5. THE GORGON'S HEAD

Rēs difficillima erat caput Gorgonis abscīdere; eius enim cōnspectū 
homines in saxum vertēbantur. Propter hanc causam Minerva
speculum Perseō dederat. Ille igitur tergum vertit, et in speculum
inspiciēbat; hōc modō ad locum vēnit ubi Medūsa dormiēbat. Tum
falce suā caput eius ūnō ictū abscīdit. Ceterae Gorgonēs statim ē 
somnō excitatae sunt, et ubi rem vīdērunt, īrā commōtae sunt.
Arma rapuērunt, et Perseum occīdere volēbant. Ille autem dum
fūgit, galeam magicam induit; et ubi hoc fēcit, statim ē cōnspectū
eārum ēvāsit.


It was really hard to cut off a Gorgon's head; because the sight of one
turned humans to stone.  It was on account of this that Minerva had given
Perseus a mirror.  So he turned his back, and looked in the mirror;
in this way he came to the place where Medusa was sleeping.
Then he cut off her head with a single stroke of his scythe.
The other Gorgons immediately woke from their sleep, and when they
saw what had happened, were moved with rage.
They grapped their weapons, and wanted to strike Perseus down.
But he fled, while donning the magic helmet; and when he did,
he immediately winked out of their sight.
