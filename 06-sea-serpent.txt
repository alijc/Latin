6. THE SEA-SERPENT

Post haec Perseus in fīnēs Aethiopum vēnit. Ibi Cēpheus quīdam 
illō tempore regnābat. Hīc Neptūnum, maris deum, ōlim
offenderat; Neptūnus autem mōnstrum saevissimum mīserat. Hoc
cotīdiē ē marī veniēbat et hominēs devorābat. Ob hanc causam
pavor animōs omnium occupāverat. Cēpheus igitur ōrāculum deī 
Hammōnis cōnsuluit, atque ā deō iussus est fīliam mōnstrō trādere.
Eius autem fīlia, nōmine Andromeda, virgō fōrmōsissima erat.
Cēpheus ubi haec audīvit, magnum dolōrem percēpit. Volēbat
tamen cīvēs suōs ē tantō perīculō extrahere, atque ob eam causam
imperāta Hammōnis facere cōnstituit.

After this Perseus entered Ethiopia, which a certain Cepheus was 
then king over.  He had once given offense to Neptune, the god of
the sea, and Neptune had released a most savage monster.  Every day
it would come out of the sea and devour people.  On account of this
terror had seized the hearts of all.  Therefore Cepheus consulted 
the oracle of the god Hammon, and was ordered by the god to deliver
his daughter to the monster.  But his daughter, Andromeda by name,
was an exceedingly beautiful maiden.  When Cepheus heard these words,
he felt a great sorrow.  Nevertheless, he wanted to rescue his countrymen
from such a great danger, and for this reason set to bring about the
commands of Hammon.
