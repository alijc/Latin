10. POLYDECTES IS TURNED TO STONE

Postquam Perseus ad īnsulam nāvem appulit, sē ad locum contulit
ubi mater ōlim habitāverat, sed domum invēnit vacuam et omnīnō
dēsertam. Trēs diēs per tōtam īnsulam mātrem quaerēbat; tandem
quartō diē ad templum Diānae pervēnit. Hūc Danaë refūgerat, quod
Polydectem timēbat. Perseus ubi haec cognōvit, īrā magnā
commōtus est; ad rēgiam Polydectis sine morā contendit, et ubi eō
vēnit, statim in ātrium irrūpit. Polydectēs magnō timōre affectus est
et fugere volēbat. Dum tamen ille fūgit, Perseus caput Medūsae
mōnstrāvit; ille autem simul atque hoc vīdit, in saxum versus est.


After Perseus had moored the ship at the island, he took himself off to the
place where his mother used to live, but found the house empty
and utterly deserted.  He looked for his mother over the whole island
for three days; and finally, on the fourth day, arrived at the temple 
of Diana.  Danae had come here for refuge, for fear of Polydectes.
When Perseus learned these things he was moved with a great rage.
He hastened to Polydectes' palace without delay, and when he got there,
immediately burst into the fore-court. Polydectes was shaken with 
terror and wished to flee.  But as he fled, Perseus showed him the
head of Medusa; and the instant he saw it, he was turned to stone.
