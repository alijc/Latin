12. THE HATRED OF JUNO

Herculēs, Alcmēnae fīlius, ōlim in Graeciā habitābat. Hic omnium 1
hominum validissimus fuisse dīcitur. At Iūnō, regīna deōrum,
Alcmēnam ōderat et Herculem adhuc īnfantem necāre voluit. Mīsit
igitur duās serpentēs saevissimās; hae mediā nocte in cubiculum
Alcmēnae venērunt, ubi Herculēs cum fratre suō dormiēbat. Nec 5
tamen in cūnīs, sed in scūtō magnō cubābant. Serpentēs iam
appropinquāverant et scūtum movēbant; itaque puerī ē somnō
excitātī sunt.


Once upon a time, Hercules, the son of Alcmena, lived in Greece.
They say that he was the strongest man in the world.
But Juno, the queen of the gods, hated Alcmena and 
wanted to kill Hercules when he was only a baby.
And so she sent two fierce and savage serpents.
In the middle of the night they came to Alcmena's bedroom, 
where Hercules was sleeping with his brother. 
But not in a cradle, but lying asleep on a great shield.
Now the serpents approached the shield and nudged it;
and so the boys were roused from their sleep.
