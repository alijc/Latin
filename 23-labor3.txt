23. 3rd LABOR: THE CERYNEAN STAG

Postquam Eurystheō caedēs Hydrae nuntiāta est, magnus timor
animum eius occupāvit. Iussit igitur Herculem cervum quendam ad
sē referre; nōluit enim virum tantae audāciae in urbe retinēre. Hic
autem cervus, cuius cornua aurea fuisse trāduntur, incrēdibilī fuit
celeritāte. Herculēs igitur prīmō vestigiīs eum in silvā
persequēbatur; deinde ubi cervum ipsum vīdit, omnibus vīribus
currere coepit. Ūsque ad vesperum currēbat, neque nocturnum
tempus sibi ad quiētem relinquēbat, frustrā tamen; nūllō enim
modō cervum cōnsequī poterat. Tandem postquam tōtum annum
cucurrerat (ita trāditur), cervum cursū exanimātum cēpit, et vīvum
ad Eurystheum rettulit.

After the killing of the Hydra had been announced to Eurystheus,
a great fear settled in his heart.  And so he ordered Hercules
fetch for him a certain stag; for he didn't want such a bold man
staying in the city.  But this stag, who is said to have had 
golden horns, had incredible speed.  Therefore Hercules at first
pursued him by his tracks in the forest; then, when he saw the stag itself,
began to run with all his might.  He ran until evening, and didn't 
leave off at night for his own rest, but in vain;
for he couldn't catch up with the stag by any means.  At last,
after he had run for an entire year (so they say), he caught
the stag, exhausted by running, and carried it, alive, to Eurystheus.
