34. THE BATTLE

Pālus erat nōn magna inter duōs exercitūs; neutrī tamen initium
trānseundī facere volēbant. Tandem Herculēs signum dedit, et ubi
palūdem trānsiit, proelium commīsit.
Amāzonēs impetum virōrum fortissimē sustinuērunt, et contrā
opīniōnem omnium tantam virtūtem praestitērunt ut multōs eōrum
occīderint, multōs etiam in fugam coniēcerint. Virī enim novō
genere pugnae perturbābantur nec magnam virtūtem praestābant.
Herculēs autem cum haec vidēret, de suīs fortunīs desperāre coepit.
Militēs igitur vehementer cohortātus est ut prīstinae virtūtis
memoriam retinērent neu tantum dēdecus admitterent, hostiumque
impetum fortiter sustinērent; quibus verbīs animōs omnium ita
ērēxit ut multī etiam quī vulneribus confectī essent proelium sine
morā redintegrārent.


There was a marsh between the two armies that wasn't very large;
but neither army was willing to be the first to cross it.  At last
Hercules gave the signal and the battle joined as soon as he had
crossed over.  The Amazons held off the attack of the men with
great courage, and, counter to everyone's expectation, showed such
great strength that they slaughtered many of Hercules' men and
threw even more into flight.  For the men were thrown into
confusion by the new type of fighting and didn't show great
courage.  But when Hercules saw this, he began to despair of his
fortune.  Then he vehemently exhorted his soldiers to hold fast to
the memory of their original courage and not permit such a
disgrace, and to bravely check the assault of the enemy; With these
words he roused everyone's courage so much that even many who had
been wounded renewed the fight without delay.
