35. THE DEFEAT OF THE AMAZONS
Diū et acriter pugnātum est; tandem tamen ad sōlis occāsum tanta 
commutātiō rērum facta est ut mulierēs terga verterent et fugā
salūtem peterent. Multae autem vulneribus defēssae dum fugiunt
captae sunt, in quō numerō ipsa erat Hippolytē. Herculēs summam
clementiam praestitit, et postquam balteum accēpit, libertātem 
omnibus captīvīs dedit. Tum vērō sociōs ad mare rēdūxit, et quod
nōn multum aestātis supererat, in Graeciam proficīscī maturāvit.
Nāvem igitur cōnscendit, et tempestātem idōneam nactus statim
solvit; antequam tamen in Graeciam pervēnit, ad urbem Troiam
nāvem appellere cōnstituit, frūmentum enim quod sēcum habēbat 
iam dēficere coeperat.


Long and bitter was the battle; yet finally, towards sundown,
such a reversal of matters came about that the women turned
their backs sought refuge in flight. But many, exhausted by
their wounds, were captured as they fled.  One of them was
Hippolyte herself.  Hercules showed her the greatest mercy, and
after he received her girdle, gave all the captives their
liberty.  Then indeed he led his allies back to the sea, and
because not much of the summer was left, hastened to depart.
Therefore he boarded the ship, and, finding a favorable wind,
set sail at once.  But before he reached Greece, he decided to
put the ship ashore at the city of Troy, because he was
beginning to run out of his supply of grain.
