39. THE GOLDEN SHIP

Dum hic morātur, Herculēs magnum incommodum ex calōre sōlis
accipiēbat; tandem igitur īrā commōtus arcum suum intendit et
sōlem sagittīs petiit. Sōl tamen audāciam virī tantum admirātus est
ut lintrem auream eī dederit. Herculēs hoc dōnum libentissimē
accēpit, nūllam enim nāvem in hīs regiōnibus invenīre potuerat.
Tum lintrem dēdūxit, et ventum nactus idōneum post breve tempus
ad īnsulam pervēnit. Ubi ex incolīs cognōvit quō in locō bovēs
essent, in eam partem statim profectus est et ā rēge Gēryone
postulāvit ut bovēs sibi trāderentur. Cum tamen ille hoc facere
nōllet, Herculēs et rēgem ipsum et Eurytiōnem, quī erat ingentī
magnitūdine corporis, interfēcit.

While he lingered there, Hercules was greatly annoyed by the heat of
the sun: and so at last, provoked by anger, he drew his bow and shot
an arrow at the sun.  Now the sun so admired the audacity of the man
that it gave him a golden ship.  Hercules accepted this gift with
great pleasure, for he hadn't been able to find a ship in this
region.  Then he launched the ship, and, after he found a favorable
wind, reached the island in a little while.  When he learned from the
inhabitants what place the oxen were in, he straightway set out for
it and demanded of King Geryon that he hand the oxen over to him.
Yet since he was unwilling to do this, Hercules killed both the king
himself and Eurytionus, who was enormous.
