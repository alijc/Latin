43. HERCULES DISCOVERS THE THEFT

Posterō diē simul atque ē somnō excitātus est, Herculēs furtum
animadvertit et bovēs āmissōs omnibus locīs quaerēbat. Hōs tamen
nusquam reperīre poterat, nōn modō quod locī natūram ignorābat,
sed quod vestigiīs falsīs deceptus est. Tandem cum magnam
partem diēī frustrā cōnsumpsisset, cum reliquīs bōbus progredī
cōnstituit. At dum proficiscī parat, ūnus ē bōbus quōs sēcum habuit
mugīre coepit. Subitō eī quī in spēluncā inclusī erant mugitum
reddidērunt, et hōc modō Herculem certiōrem fēcerunt quō in locō
cēlātī essent. Ille vehementer īrātus ad spēluncam quam celerrimē
sē cōntulit, ut praedam reciperet. At Cācus saxum ingens ita 
dēiēcerat ut adītus spēluncae omnīnō obstruerētur.

 Postero die simul atque e somno excitatus est, Hercules furtum
 animadvertit et boves amissos omnibus locis quaerebat. Hos tamen
 nusquam reperire poterat, non modo quod loci naturam ignorabat,
 sed quod vestigiis falsis deceptus est. Tandem cum magnam partem
 diei frustra consumpsisset, cum reliquis bobus progredi
 constituit. At dum proficisci parat, unus e bobus quos secum
 habuit mugire coepit. Subito ii qui in spelunca inclusi erant
 mugitum reddiderunt, et hoc modo Herculem certiorem fecerunt quo
 in loco celati essent. Ille vehementer iratus ad speluncam quam
 celerrime se contulit, ut praedam reciperet. At Cacus saxum ingens
 ita deiecerat ut aditus speluncae omnino obstrueretur.

On the next day, as soon as he awoke, Hercules noticed the theft
and searched all around for the missing oxen.  But he couldn't find
them anywhere, not only because he didn't know the nature of the
place, but also because he was misled by the false trail.  At last,
when he had spent a great part of the day in vain, he decided to go
on with the rest of the oxen.  But while he was getting ready to
set out, one of the oxen that he had with him began to
bellow. Suddenly the ones that had been shut up in the cave
bellowed back, and so made Hercules sure that they
had been hidden nearby.  Very much angered, he carried himself off
to the cave as quickly as he could to recover his spoils.  But
Cacus had thrown such a huge stone down that the cave's entrance
was blocked up altogether.
