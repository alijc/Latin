Book I section [47] 

Sed haec eius diei praefertur opinio,
 ut se utrique superiores discessisse existimarent:
 Afraniani, quod,
 cum esse omnium iudicio inferiores viderentur,
 comminus tam diu stetissent et nostrorum impetum sustinuissent
 et initio locum tumulumque tenuissent,
 quae causa pugnandi fuerat,
 et nostros primo congressu terga vertere coegissent;

But the preferred belief about that day is 
how each/which/both superior forces might have reckoned to have withdrawn:
Afranius's, because,
while they seemed to be inferior in everyone's judgement,
they had stood firm in close combat all day and had sustained
the our men's attack, and had held their position on the hill at first,
in which cause it had been about to be fought,
and had forced our men to turn tail in the first encounter;


 nostri autem,
 quod iniquo loco atque impari congressi numero quinque horis proelium
 sustinuissent,
 quod montem gladiis destrictis ascendissent,
 quod ex loco superiore terga vertere adversarios coegissent atque in oppidum
 compulissent.

But our men, because they had borne up despite their unfavorable position and,
having fought against uneven odds for five hours,
had climbed the mountain with drawn swords,
and had forced their adversaries to retreat from the higher ground 
and driven them into the town.


Illi eum tumulum, pro quo pugnatum est,
 magnis operibus munierunt praesidiumque ibi posuerunt.

These by great efforts protected the hill, for which it was fought,
and placed the garrison there.
