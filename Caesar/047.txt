Book I section [47] 

Sed haec eius diei praefertur opinio,
 ut se utrique superiores discessisse existimarent:
 Afraniani, quod,
 cum esse omnium iudicio inferiores viderentur,
 comminus tam diu stetissent et nostrorum impetum sustinuissent
 et initio locum tumulumque tenuissent,
 quae causa pugnandi fuerat,
 et nostros primo congressu terga vertere coegissent;

But this opinion of his day is preferred,
that on both sides the higher might have thought to have withdrawn:
Afranius's, because,
when the lower ones were seen to be in the judgement of all,
they had stood firm in close combat all day and had sustained
the of our men attack and had held their position on the hill at
the beginning,
in which cause it had been about to be fought,
and had forced our men to turn tail in the first encounter;


 nostri autem,
 quod iniquo loco atque impari congressi numero quinque horis proelium
 sustinuissent,
 quod montem gladiis destrictis ascendissent,
 quod ex loco superiore terga vertere adversarios coegissent atque in oppidum
 compulissent.

But our men, because they had sustained by an disadvantageous position and
having joined in battle by/to uneven number for a fight of five hours,
that/because they had climbed the mountain with swords drawn(?),
that/because from the higher ground they had forced their adversaries to retreat
and driven them into the town.


Illi eum tumulum, pro quo pugnatum est,
 magnis operibus munierunt praesidiumque ibi posuerunt.

These by great efforts protected the hill, for which it was fought,
and placed the garrison there.
