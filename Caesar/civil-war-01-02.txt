Book I section 2:

Haec Scipionis oratio, quod senatus in urbe habebatur Pompeiusque
aberat, ex ipsius ore Pompei mitti videbatur. Dixerat aliquis leniorem
sententiam, ut primo M. Marcellus, ingressus in eam orationem, non
oportere ante de ea re ad senatum referri, quam dilectus tota Italia
habiti et exercitus conscripti essent, quo praesidio tuto et libere
senatus, quae vellet, decernere auderet; ut M. Calidius, qui censebat,
ut Pompeius in suas provincias proficisceretur, ne qua esset armorum
causa: timere Caesarem ereptis ab eo duabus legionibus, ne ad eius
periculum reservare et retinere eas ad urbem Pompeius videretur; ut
M. Rufus, qui sententiam Calidii paucis fere mutatis rebus
sequebatur. Hi omnes convicio L. Lentuli consulis correpti
exagitabantur. Lentulus sententiam Calidii pronuntiaturum se omnino
negavit. Marcellus perterritus conviciis a sua sententia
discessit. Sic vocibus consulis, terrore praesentis exercitus, minis
amicorum Pompei plerique compulsi inviti et coacti Scipionis
sententiam sequuntur: uti ante certam diem Caesar exercitum dimittat;
si non faciat, eum adversus rem publicam facturum videri. Intercedit
M. Antonius, Q. Cassius, tribuni plebis. Refertur confestim de
intercessione tribunorum. Dicuntur sententiae graves; ut quisque
acerbissime crudelissimeque dixit, ita quam maxime ab inimicis
Caesaris collaudatur.

This speech of Scipio's, because the senate was held in the city
and Pompey was not present, seemed to be dispatched from the mouth
of Pompey himself. 

Someone had spoken a milder opinion, so that at first M. Marcellus,
who had embarked on the speech, that is was not previously fitting
to open a debate on the matter to the senate, that musters had been 
 held through all of Italy and an army had been raised, with
which a secure defense and the senate would freely resolve to
determine what it wished;

so that M. Calidius, who was voting for Pompey to depart for
provinces, so that there'd be no occasion for arms: that
Caesar feared that his two legions would be taken from him, 
so that Pompey would not seem to reserve and retain them at the
city to his peril; so that M. Rufus was following wildly, with
slightly different words.

They were all seized and disturbed by consul L. Lentulus' clamor.

Lentulus said that he was not going to proclaim the opinion of
Calidius, Marcellus backed away from his own opinion, thoroughly
frightened by the clamor.

Thus/so, by the voices of the consul, in fear of the army in sight,
by threats from the friends of Pompey and very many compelled
against their will and coerced followed the opinion of Scipio: so
that before a set day Caesar should dismiss his army; and if he
did not, then the republic would make him to do so by force.

M. Antonius Q. Cassius, one of the tribunes of the plebs,
interrupted.  A debate on the interruption of the tribunes was
immediately opened.

Serious opinions were stated; so that each man very stridently and
harshly spoke, so that he was praised as much as possible by the
enemies of Caesar.
