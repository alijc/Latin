Book I section 2:

Haec Scipionis oratio, quod senatus in urbe habebatur Pompeiusque
aberat, ex ipsius ore Pompei mitti videbatur. Dixerat aliquis leniorem
sententiam, ut primo M. Marcellus, ingressus in eam orationem, non
oportere ante de ea re ad senatum referri, quam dilectus tota Italia
habiti et exercitus conscripti essent, quo praesidio tuto et libere
senatus, quae vellet, decernere auderet; ut M. Calidius, qui censebat,
ut Pompeius in suas provincias proficisceretur, ne qua esset armorum
causa: timere Caesarem ereptis ab eo duabus legionibus, ne ad eius
periculum reservare et retinere eas ad urbem Pompeius videretur; ut
M. Rufus, qui sententiam Calidii paucis fere mutatis rebus
sequebatur. Hi omnes convicio L. Lentuli consulis correpti
exagitabantur. Lentulus sententiam Calidii pronuntiaturum se omnino
negavit. Marcellus perterritus conviciis a sua sententia
discessit. Sic vocibus consulis, terrore praesentis exercitus, minis
amicorum Pompei plerique compulsi inviti et coacti Scipionis
sententiam sequuntur: uti ante certam diem Caesar exercitum dimittat;
si non faciat, eum adversus rem publicam facturum videri. Intercedit
M. Antonius, Q. Cassius, tribuni plebis. Refertur confestim de
intercessione tribunorum. Dicuntur sententiae graves; ut quisque
acerbissime crudelissimeque dixit, ita quam maxime ab inimicis
Caesaris collaudatur.

This speech of Scipio's, since the senate was held in the city and
Pompey was not present, seemed to be coming from the mouth of
Pompey himself.  Someone had uttered a milder thought, so that at
first M. Marcellus, who had embarked on a speech, that is was not
fitting to open a debate on the matter to the senate, before
musters had been held through all of Italy and an army had been
raised, with which prudent protection even the senate could freely
resolve to decide what it wished; while M. Calidius was advocating
for Pompey to depart for the provinces, so that there'd be no
occasion for arms: that Caesar feared, which two legions taken away
from him, that Pompey seemed to have reserved and retained them
near the city to his peril; while M. Rufus followed, with slightly
different words.  They were all roundly reproached by consul
L. Lentulus.  Lentulus said that he was not going to proclaim the
opinion of Calidius, Marcellus backed away from his own opinion,
thoroughly frightened by the reproach.  So, by means of the
utterances of the consul, the fear of a nearby army, the threats
from the friends of Pompey and a great many, compelled and coerced
against their will, followed the opinion of Scipio: so that before
a set day Caesar must dismiss his army; and if he did not, then the
republic would be seen to make him an enemy.  M. Antonius and
Q. Cassius, the tribunes of the people, objected.  A debate on the
objection of the tribunes was immediately opened.  Serious opinions
were stated; so that each man very stridently and harshly spoke, so
that he was praised as much as possible by the enemies of Caesar.
