Book I section 2:

Haec Scipionis oratio, quod senatus in urbe habebatur Pompeiusque
aberat, ex ipsius ore Pompei mitti videbatur. Dixerat aliquis leniorem
sententiam, ut primo M. Marcellus, ingressus in eam orationem, non
oportere ante de ea re ad senatum referri, quam dilectus tota Italia
habiti et exercitus conscripti essent, quo praesidio tuto et libere
senatus, quae vellet, decernere auderet; ut M. Calidius, qui censebat,
ut Pompeius in suas provincias proficisceretur, ne qua esset armorum
causa: timere Caesarem ereptis ab eo duabus legionibus, ne ad eius
periculum reservare et retinere eas ad urbem Pompeius videretur; ut
M. Rufus, qui sententiam Calidii paucis fere mutatis rebus
sequebatur. Hi omnes convicio L. Lentuli consulis correpti
exagitabantur. Lentulus sententiam Calidii pronuntiaturum se omnino
negavit. Marcellus perterritus conviciis a sua sententia
discessit. Sic vocibus consulis, terrore praesentis exercitus, minis
amicorum Pompei plerique compulsi inviti et coacti Scipionis
sententiam sequuntur: uti ante certam diem Caesar exercitum dimittat;
si non faciat, eum adversus rem publicam facturum videri. Intercedit
M. Antonius, Q. Cassius, tribuni plebis. Refertur confestim de
intercessione tribunorum. Dicuntur sententiae graves; ut quisque
acerbissime crudelissimeque dixit, ita quam maxime ab inimicis
Caesaris collaudatur.

This speech of Scipio's, since the senate was held in the city and
Pompey was not present, seemed to be coming from the mouth of
Pompey himself.  Others had stated a milder opinion, first
M. Marcellus had advanced the argument that it was not proper to
open a debate on the matter to the senate before musters had been
held through all of Italy and an army had been raised, under whose
prudent protection the senate could freely resolve to decide what
it wished; next M. Calidius advocated for Pompey to depart for his
own provinces, so that there'd be no occasion for arms: that
Caesar feared, with two legions taken away from him, that Pompey
seemed to have reserved and retained them near the city to his
peril; then M. Rufus followed the opinion of Calidius, with
slightly different words.  They were all roundly reproached by
consul L. Lentulus.  Lentulus said that he was not going to
proclaim the opinion of Calidius. Marcellus backed away from his
own opinion, thoroughly frightened by the reproach.  So, due to
the consul's speeches, the fear of a nearby army, and the threats
from the friends of Pompey, a great many, compelled and coerced
against their will, followed the opinion of Scipio: so that before
a set day Caesar must dismiss his army; and if he did not, then he
would be seen as an enemy of the republic.  M. Antonius and
Q. Cassius, the tribunes of the people, objected.  A debate on the
objection of the tribunes was immediately opened.  Serious
opinions were stated; so that the more each man spoke stridently
and harshly, the more he was praised by the enemies of Caesar.
