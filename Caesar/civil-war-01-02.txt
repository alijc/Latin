Book I section 2:

Haec Scipionis oratio, quod senatus in urbe habebatur Pompeiusque
aberat, ex ipsius ore Pompei mitti videbatur. Dixerat aliquis leniorem
sententiam, ut primo M. Marcellus, ingressus in eam orationem, non
oportere ante de ea re ad senatum referri, quam dilectus tota Italia
habiti et exercitus conscripti essent, quo praesidio tuto et libere
senatus, quae vellet, decernere auderet; ut M. Calidius, qui censebat,
ut Pompeius in suas provincias proficisceretur, ne qua esset armorum
causa: timere Caesarem ereptis ab eo duabus legionibus, ne ad eius
periculum reservare et retinere eas ad urbem Pompeius videretur; ut
M. Rufus, qui sententiam Calidii paucis fere mutatis rebus
sequebatur. Hi omnes convicio L. Lentuli consulis correpti
exagitabantur. Lentulus sententiam Calidii pronuntiaturum se omnino
negavit. Marcellus perterritus conviciis a sua sententia
discessit. Sic vocibus consulis, terrore praesentis exercitus, minis
amicorum Pompei plerique compulsi inviti et coacti Scipionis
sententiam sequuntur: uti ante certam diem Caesar exercitum dimittat;
si non faciat, eum adversus rem publicam facturum videri. Intercedit
M. Antonius, Q. Cassius, tribuni plebis. Refertur confestim de
intercessione tribunorum. Dicuntur sententiae graves; ut quisque
acerbissime crudelissimeque dixit, ita quam maxime ab inimicis
Caesaris collaudatur.

This speech of Scipio's, because the senate was held in the city and
Pompey was not present, seemed to be sent from the mouth of Pompey
himself.  He had spoken a gentler opinion to some people, so that to
the first M. Marcellus, having embarked on the speech, to require that
debate be opened on the matter to the senate previously, which
conscription was being held by all of Italy and an army had been
raised, by which prudent protection and freely the senate, which was
willing, intended to resolve these matters; so that M Calidius, who
was judging/voting/thinking for Pompey into his provinces/commands,
lest by which cause it would be of the arms: to fear Caesar to/by
those taken by force/rescued by the two legions, lest to his peril to
spare/reserve and hold fast them(f) at/to the city Pompey was seen;
so that M. Rufus, who 
the opinion of Calidius to/by small (in general) changed the matters
supported.
All of these, chastised by consul L. Lentulus' outcry, were stirred
up/driven out.
Lentulus denied that he was going to proclaim the opinion of Calidius.
Marcellus withdrew, thoroughly frightened by the outcries from his own
opinion. Thus/so, by the voices of the consul, in dread of the
present army, by threats of the friends of Pompey and (of the)
majority driven together reluctant and compelled followed the
opinion of Scipio: so that before a certain day Caesar would
dismiss his army; and if he did not, then his opponent would
force him to do so.  M. Antonius, Q. Cassius, the tribunes of the
plebs interrupted???  A debate was immediately opened on the
intervention of the tribunes.  Serious opinions were stated; in
order that to/by each one most stridently and harshly asserted,
thus as greatly as possible by enemies Caesar was praised.
