Book I section 3:

Misso ad vesperum senatu omnes, qui sunt eius ordinis, a Pompeio evocantur.
Laudat promptos Pompeius atque in posterum confirmat, segniores castigat
atque incitat.  Multi undique ex veteribus Pompei exercitibus spe praemiorum
atque ordinum evocantur, multi ex duabus legionibus, quae sunt traditae a
Caesare, arcessuntur.  Completur urbs et ipsum comitium tribunis,
centurionibus, evocatis.  Omnes amici consulum, necessarii Pompei atque
eorum, qui veteres inimicitias cum Caesare gerebant, in senatum coguntur;
quorum vocibus et concursu terrentur infirmiores, dubii confirmantur,
plerisque vero libere decernendi potestas eripitur.  Pollicetur L. Piso
censor sese iturum ad Caesarem, item L. Roscius praetor, qui de his rebus
eum doceant: sex dies ad eam rem conficiendam spatii postulant.  Dicuntur
etiam ab nonnullis sententiae, ut legati ad Caesarem mittantur, qui
voluntatem senatus ei proponant.


Towards evening, after the senate was dismissed, everyone who was of
Pompey's company was summoned to him.  He praised those who had led and
reassured them in what was to come, and chastised and urged on the slower
ones.  Many of the veterans of Pompey's armies were summoned from all over
by the hope for rewards and advancement.  Many were sent for from the two
legions that had been handed over by Caesar.  The city and the assembly were
filled with tribunes, centurions, and veterans.  All of the consuls'
friends, all those connected to Pompey and those who held a longstanding
enmity towards Caesar, gathered in the senate.  And by their uproar and
tumult the weaker were frightened and the wavering strengthened, and indeed
the ability to freely decide was snatched away from many.  L. Piso, the
censor, promised that he himself would make the trip to Caesar, and also the
praetor L. Roscius, to report these matters to him: They request six days
for them to accomplish this.  It was also said in several statements that
envoys should be sent to Caesar, to set forth to him the goodwill of the
senate.
