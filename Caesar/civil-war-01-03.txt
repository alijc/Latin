Book I section 3:

Misso ad vesperum senatu omnes, qui sunt eius ordinis, a Pompeio evocantur.

Laudat promptos Pompeius atque in posterum confirmat, segniores castigat atque
incitat. 

Multi undique ex veteribus Pompei exercitibus spe praemiorum atque ordinum
evocantur, multi ex duabus legionibus, quae sunt traditae a Caesare,
arcessuntur. 

Completur urbs et ipsum comitium tribunis, centurionibus, evocatis. 

Omnes amici consulum, necessarii Pompei atque eorum, qui veteres inimicitias cum
Caesare gerebant, in senatum coguntur; 

quorum vocibus et concursu terrentur infirmiores, dubii confirmantur, plerisque
vero libere decernendi potestas eripitur. 

Pollicetur L. Piso censor sese iturum ad Caesarem, item L. Roscius praetor, qui
de his rebus eum doceant: 

sex dies ad eam rem conficiendam spatii postulant. 

Dicuntur etiam ab nonnullis sententiae, ut legati ad Caesarem mittantur, qui
voluntatem senatus ei proponant.


Towards evening, when the senate was dismissed, everyone who was of his rank was
summoned by Pompey.

Pompey praised those who had led and reassured those who had followed next, and
chastised and urged on the slower ones.

Many were lured out of the experienced armies of Pompey from every side by the
hope for rewards and order, many were sent for from the two legions that had
been handed over by Caesar,

The city and the assembly was satisfied by the tribunes, the centurions,
and the veterans.

All the friends of the consul, the necessities of Pompey and his men, who
were waging longstanding hostilities with Caesar, were gathered in the
senate;

By whose voices and agreement the frail were frightened, the doubtful
reassured, and indeed from many the power was shamelessly snatched away.

L. Piso, the censor, promised that he himself would march towards Caesar,
and likewise the praetor L. Roscius, who might teach him about these
matters:

They demand six days for them to complete this space.

They are also said from several opinions, to send an envoy to Caesar, who
would put forward the goodwill of the senate to him.
