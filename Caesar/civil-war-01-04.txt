Book I section 4: 

Omnibus his resistitur, omnibusque oratio consulis, Scipionis, Catonis
opponitur. Catonem veteres inimicitiae Caesaris incitant et dolor
repulsae. Lentulus aeris alieni magnitudine et spe exercitus ac provinciarum et
regum appellandorum largitionibus movetur, seque alterum fore Sullam inter suos
gloriatur, ad quem summa imperii redeat. Scipionem eadem spes provinciae atque
exercituum impellit, quos se pro necessitudine partiturum cum Pompeio
arbitratur, simul iudiciorum metus, adulatio atque ostentatio sui et potentium,
qui in re publica iudiciisque tum plurimum pollebant. Ipse Pompeius, ab inimicis
Caesaris incitatus, et quod neminem dignitate secum exaequari volebat, totum se
ab eius amicitia averterat et cum communibus inimicis in gratiam redierat,
quorum ipse maximam partem illo affinitatis tempore iniunxerat Caesari; simul
infamia duarum legionum permotus, quas ab itinere Asiae Syriaeque ad suam
potentiam dominatumque converterat, rem ad arma deduci studebat.

It was resisted by every man, and the speech of the consul Scipio, Cato was
opposed by all.  

The veterans of Caesar's war and the pain of defeat arouse
Cato. 

Lentulus is moved by the extent of foreign money and by the expectation of
the army and of the provinces and by the largess of the kings that needed to be
appealled to, and he boasts that he would be another Sulla in the forum among
his men, to whom he's return the utmost matters of command.

Likewise, the hope of the provincde and the armies impels Scipio, who himself
for the necessity of share with Pompey is considered, 
at the same time the fear of verdicts,
his flattery and ostentation and of powerful,
who exerted the most influence in the republic and by legal actions then.

Pompey himself, urged on by the enemies of Caesar, and what no one wanted by
position to be made equal with him, had turned himself completely away from his
friendship and gone back with common enemies in favor, of whom he himself 
had united to Caesar
the greatest part in that time of in-law-dom;
likewise
influenced by the the disgrace of the two legions,
that had turned back from the road to Asia and Syria to his power and domain, 
he busied himself with the matter of being drawn to arms.
