Book I section [5] 

His de causis aguntur omnia raptim atque turbate.  Nec docendi
Caesaris propinquis eius spatium datur, nec tribunis plebis
sui periculi deprecandi neque etiam extremi iuris
intercessione retinendi, quod L. Sulla reliquerat, facultas
tribuitur, sed de sua salute septimo die cogitare coguntur,
quod illi turbulentissimi superioribus temporibus tribuni
plebis octavo denique mense suarum actionum respicere ac
timere consuerant.  Decurritur ad illud extremum atque ultimum
senatus consultum, quo nisi paene in ipso urbis incendio atque
in desperatione omnium salutis sceleratorum audacia numquam
ante descensum est: dent operam consules, praetores, tribuni
plebis, quique pro consulibus sint ad urbem, ne quid res
publica detrimenti capiat.  Haec senatusconsulto perscribuntur
a.d. VII Id. Ian. Itaque V primis diebus, quibus haberi
senatus potuit, qua ex die consulatum iniit Lentulus, biduo
excepto comitiali et de imperio Caesaris et de amplissimis
viris, tribunis plebis, gravissime acerbissimeque decernitur.
Profugiunt statim ex urbe tribuni plebis seseque ad Caesarem
conferunt.  Is eo tempore erat Ravennae exspectabatque suis
lenissimis postulatis responsa, si qua hominum aequitate res
ad otium deduci posset.


For these reasons they all acted with haste and confusion.
Time was not given to those close to Caesar for informing him,
or to the people's tribunes for escaping their peril, not even
of the limit of the law of retaining the veto that L. Sulla
had left them, the power was granted, but they are forced to
consider regarding their own safety on the seventh day, where
in recent times the most unruly people's tribunes had become
accustomed to consider and to fear only in the eighth month of
their term.  Recourse is given to that final and ultimate
decision of the senate which had never before been sunk to,
unless the city is faced with fire and in dispair of all
safety from bold criminals: Let the consules, praetors,
people's tribunes and whichever proconsuls are near the city
take care lest the republic should seize defeat.  These things
were detailed in a decree of the senate on the 7th day before
the Ides of January.  Accordingly, on the first five days in
which the senate could be held, on the day that Lentulus
assumed the consulship, save for two days taken out for the
election, the matter was decided most seriously and bitterly
regarding Caesar's command and the most important men,
tribunes and plebians.  The people's tribunes fled the city at
once and betook themselves to Caesar.  At that time he was in
Ravenna and was awaiting answers to his mildest requests, if
by the fairness of men the matter could be led to a peaceful
end.
