Book I section [5] 

His de causis aguntur omnia raptim atque turbate. 

Nec docendi Caesaris propinquis eius spatium datur, nec tribunis plebis sui
periculi deprecandi neque etiam extremi iuris intercessione retinendi, quod
L. Sulla reliquerat, facultas tribuitur, sed de sua salute septimo die cogitare
coguntur, quod illi turbulentissimi superioribus temporibus tribuni plebis
octavo denique mense suarum actionum respicere ac timere consuerant.  

Decurritur ad illud extremum atque ultimum senatus consultum, quo nisi paene in
ipso urbis incendio atque in desperatione omnium salutis sceleratorum audacia
numquam ante descensum est: dent operam consules, praetores, tribuni plebis,
quique pro consulibus sint ad urbem, ne quid res publica detrimenti capiat.  

Haec senatusconsulto perscribuntur a.d. VII Id. Ian. Itaque V primis diebus,
quibus haberi senatus potuit, qua ex die consulatum iniit Lentulus, biduo
excepto comitiali et de imperio Caesaris et de amplissimis viris, tribunis
plebis, gravissime acerbissimeque decernitur. Profugiunt statim ex urbe tribuni
plebis seseque ad Caesarem conferunt.  

Is eo tempore erat Ravennae exspectabatque suis lenissimis postulatis responsa,
si qua hominum aequitate res ad otium deduci posset. 


For these reasons they all acted with haste and confusion.

Nor was time given for showing Caesar's relatives, nor to the people's tribunes
of averting the danger, not even  of the end/limit of law by veto of holding
back, that/because L. Sulla had relinquished, the opportunities are granted, 
but of his health for seven days to consider are gathered, that/because to him
the most unruly people's tribunes in the most recent times finally, in the
eighth month of his own actions they had become accustomed to consider and fear.

It is raced down to that end and to the ultimate decision of the senate,
which  if not/unless nearly into the city with an actual fire and
in desperation of all of health by the daring of the criminals
never before having been demeaned: the consules, praetors, people's tribunes
might give the work/care to whoever would be for the consuls to the city
lest the republic of defeat would seize.

These things were detailed in a decree of the senate on the 7th day before the
Ides of January.  Accordingly, on the first five days in which the senate could
be held, in which day Lentulus assumed the consulship, for two days taken out
by/to the electoral and command of Caesar and of the most important men,
tribunes and plebians, it was decided most seriously and bitterly.  
The people's tribunes fled the city at once and betook themselves to Caesar.

At that time he was in Ravenna and was awaiting answers to his mildest
requests, if by that fairness of men the matter could be led to a lull.
