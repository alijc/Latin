Book I section [6]

Proximis diebus habetur extra urbem senatus.

Pompeius eadem illa, quae per Scipionem ostenderat agit;
 senatus virtutem constantiamque collaudat;
 copias suas exponit;
 legiones habere sese paratas X;
 praeterea cognitum compertumque sibi alieno esse animo in Caesarem milites
 neque eis posse persuaderi, uti eum defendant aut sequantur. 

Statim de reliquis rebus ad senatum refertur:
 tota Italia delectus habeatur;
 Faustus Sulla propere in Mauretaniam mittatur;
 pecunia uti ex aerario Pompeio detur. 

Refertur etiam de rege Iuba, ut socius sit atque amicus;
 Marcellus vero passurum se in praesentia negat. 

De Fausto impedit Philippus, tribunus plebis. 

De reliquis rebus senatusconsulta perscribuntur. 

Provinciae privatis decernuntur duae consulares, reliquae praetoriae. 

Scipioni obvenit Syria, L. Domitio Gallia;
 Philippus et Cotta privato consilio praetereuntur,
 neque eorum sortes deiciuntur. 

In reliquas provincias praetores mittuntur. 

Neque exspectant, quod superioribus annis acciderat, ut de eorum imperio ad
populum feratur paludatique votis nuncupatis exeant. 

Consules, quod ante id tempus accidit nunquam, ex urbe proficiscuntur,
lictoresque habent in urbe et Capitolio privati contra omnia vetustatis
exempla. 

Tota Italia delectus habentur, arma imperantur; pecuniae a municipiis exiguntur,
e fanis tolluntur: omnia divina humanaque iura permiscentur.  



For the next few days the senate is held outside of of the city.

Pompey does the same things that he had shown through Scipio;
 the senate commends courage and perseverence;
 it positions its troops;
 the ten?? legions are to hold themselves in readiness;
 in addition, the known and proven by a hostile mind to them to be in Caesar
 soldiers and cannot be persuaded to oppose him or pursue him.

Of the remaining matters one is immediately proposed to the senate:
 a levy is to be held through all of Italy;
 Faustus Sulla is speedily sent to Mauretania
 to cause money to be surrendered from Pompey's treasury.

It is also proposed that King Juba could become an ally and a friend;
 However, Marcellus said that he would not allow this at present.

Philippus, the people's tribune, is obstructive about Faustus, 

Decrees of the senate are written out on the remaining matters.

The provinces are declared as the private property, two to the consuls,
the rest to the praetors.

Syria is offered to Scipio by L. Domitius Gallia;
 Philippus and Cotta are disregarded by the private debate,
 and their fates are not destroyed.

Praetors are sent to the remaining provinces.

And they do not expect what had happened in previous years, 
to bring  from their command to the people and 
of one in a military cloak might march forth by those named vows.

The consuls, because it had never happened before this time, set forth from the
city, and the lictors have in the city and Capitol of a private person
counter to all examples of antiquity.

A levy is raised through all of Italy, arms are requisitioned; 
funds are taken from the towns, and from the temples:
all divine and worldly laws are confounded.
