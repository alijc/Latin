Book I section [6]

Proximis diebus habetur extra urbem senatus.  Pompeius
eadem illa, quae per Scipionem ostenderat agit; senatus
virtutem constantiamque collaudat; copias suas exponit;
legiones habere sese paratas X; praeterea cognitum
compertumque sibi alieno esse animo in Caesarem milites
neque eis posse persuaderi, uti eum defendant aut
sequantur.  Statim de reliquis rebus ad senatum
refertur: tota Italia delectus habeatur; Faustus Sulla
propere in Mauretaniam mittatur; pecunia uti ex aerario
Pompeio detur.  Refertur etiam de rege Iuba, ut socius
sit atque amicus; Marcellus vero passurum se in
praesentia negat.  De Fausto impedit Philippus, tribunus
plebis.  De reliquis rebus senatusconsulta
perscribuntur.  Provinciae privatis decernuntur duae
consulares, reliquae praetoriae.  Scipioni obvenit
Syria, L. Domitio Gallia; Philippus et Cotta privato
consilio praetereuntur, neque eorum sortes deiciuntur.
In reliquas provincias praetores mittuntur.  Neque
exspectant, quod superioribus annis acciderat, ut de
eorum imperio ad populum feratur paludatique votis
nuncupatis exeant.  Consules, quod ante id tempus
accidit nunquam, ex urbe proficiscuntur, lictoresque
habent in urbe et Capitolio privati contra omnia
vetustatis exempla.  Tota Italia delectus habentur, arma
imperantur; pecuniae a municipiis exiguntur, e fanis
tolluntur: omnia divina humanaque iura permiscentur.



For the next few days the senate is held outside of of
the city.  Pompey reiterates what he had disclosed
through Scipio; he commends the courage and perseverence
of the senate; he reports on his troops; ten legions
holding themselves in readiness; in addition, he knows
and is assured that Caesar's soldiers are of a hostile
bent towards him and cannot be persuaded to support or
follow him.  Of the remaining matters, it is immediately
proposed to the senate: troops should be levied through
all of Italy; Faustus Sulla should be sent to Mauretania
with speed; funds should be given to Pompey from the
treasury.  Furthermore, it is proposed that King Juba
should be made an ally and a friend; However, Marcellus
says that he would not allow this at present.
Philippus, the people's tribune, is obstructive about
Faustus, Decrees of the senate are written out on the
remaining matters.  The provinces are determined as
private property, two consular and the others
praetorian.  Syria falls to Scipio, and Gaul to
L. Domitius; Philippus and Cotta are passed up in the
private debate, and their lots are not cast down.
Praetors are sent to the remaining provinces.  And they
do not wait for what had happened in previous years,
that is, taking the matter of their command to the
people, and setting out, clad in a general's cloak,
after having said their vows publicly.  The consuls set
forth from the city, which had never happened before
this time, and the lictors have in the city and Capitol
of a private person, counter to all examples of
antiquity.  A levy is raised through all of Italy, arms
are requisitioned; funds are solicited from the towns,
and taken from the temples: all divine and worldly laws
are confounded.
