Book I section [6]

Proximis diebus habetur extra urbem senatus.

Pompeius eadem illa, quae per Scipionem ostenderat agit;
 senatus virtutem constantiamque collaudat;
 copias suas exponit;
 legiones habere sese paratas X;
 praeterea cognitum compertumque sibi alieno esse animo in Caesarem milites
 neque eis posse persuaderi, uti eum defendant aut sequantur. 

Statim de reliquis rebus ad senatum refertur:
 tota Italia delectus habeatur;
 Faustus Sulla propere in Mauretaniam mittatur;
 pecunia uti ex aerario Pompeio detur. 

Refertur etiam de rege Iuba, ut socius sit atque amicus;
 Marcellus vero passurum se in praesentia negat. 

De Fausto impedit Philippus, tribunus plebis. 

De reliquis rebus senatusconsulta perscribuntur. 

Provinciae privatis decernuntur duae consulares, reliquae praetoriae. 

Scipioni obvenit Syria, L. Domitio Gallia;
 Philippus et Cotta privato consilio praetereuntur,
 neque eorum sortes deiciuntur. 

In reliquas provincias praetores mittuntur. 

Neque exspectant, quod superioribus annis acciderat, ut de eorum imperio ad
populum feratur paludatique votis nuncupatis exeant. 

Consules, quod ante id tempus accidit nunquam, ex urbe proficiscuntur,
lictoresque habent in urbe et Capitolio privati contra omnia vetustatis
exempla. 

Tota Italia delectus habentur, arma imperantur; pecuniae a municipiis exiguntur,
e fanis tolluntur: omnia divina humanaque iura permiscentur.  



For the next few days the senate is held outside of of the city.

Pompey does the same things that he had shown through Scipio;
 the senate commends courage and perseverence;
 it sets out its troops;
 the ten?? legions are to hold themselves in readiness;
 in addition, the known and proven to them by a hostile mind to be in Caesar
 soldiers and not to be able to be persuaded, in order to ward off or pursue.

At once from the remaining matters it is proposed to the senate:
 a levy to be held in all of Italy;
 Faustus Sulla is speedily sent to Mauretania;
 in order that money be surrendered from Pompey's treasury.

It is also proposed concerning King Juba, that he might be an ally and a friend;
 Indeed, Marcellus denied that he would allow it at present.

Philippus, the people's tribune, hinders concerning Faustus, 

On the remaining matters decrees of the senate are reported.

The provinces are declared as the private property of the two consules,
the rest to the praetors.

Syria, L. Domitio Gallia, meets to Scipio, 
 Philippus and Cotta are disregarding by the private debate,
 and their fates are not routed.

Praetors are sent to the remaining provinces.

And they do not expect what had happened in previous years, 
in order from their command to the people it was brought and 
those wearing military cloaks might march forth to/by those named vows.

The consuls, because it had never happened before this time, set forth from the
city, and the lictors have in the city and Capitol of a private person
all examples of antiquity.

A levy is held through all of Italy, arms are raised; 
funds are driven out from the towns, and from the temples:
all divine and worldly laws are confounded.
