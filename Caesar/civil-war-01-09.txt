Book I section [9] 

Quae res etsi nihil ad levandas iniurias pertinere videbantur, tamen idoneos
nactus homines, per quos ea, quae vellet, ad eum perferrentur, petit ab utroque,
quoniam Pompei mandata ad se detulerint, ne graventur sua quoque ad eum
postulata deferre, si parvo labore magnas controversias tollere atque omnem
Italiam metu liberare possint. 

 Although these matters seemed to do nothing towards relieving the injustices,
 nevertheless, having met with suitable men, whom he wished to convey news to
 Pompei, he asks, since they brought Pompei's demands to him, that in return,
 that they not object to carry his own demands to him, since by a little effort
 they might be able to alleviate great disputes and free all Italy from fear.

Sibi semper primam rei publicae fuisse dignitatem vitaque potiorem. 

 That "the foremost worth of the republic was greater than life to him.

Doluisse se, quod populi Romani beneficium sibi per contumeliam ab inimicis
extorqueretur, ereptoque semenstri imperio in urbem retraheretur, cuius absentis
rationem haberi proximis comitiis populus iussisset.

 He himself had suffered having the favor of the Roman people torn away
 from him by his enemies through insults, and, robbed of six months of command,
 had been called back to the city, by whose absence he was held by the next
 elections that the people had decreed.

Tamen hanc iacturam honoris sui rei publicae causa aequo animo tulisse; 

 Nevertheless, he had born the damage to his honor on account of a mind
 favorable to the republic;

cum litteras ad senatum miserit, ut omnes ab exercitibus discederent, ne id
quidem impetravisse. 

 when he had sent a letter to the senate, to demobilize all men from the armies,
 to no avail.

Tota Italia delectus haberi, retineri legiones II, quae ab se simulatione
Parthici belli sint abductae, civitatem esse in armis.

 All Italy was holding a draft, the two legions that had been drawn off by the
 pretense of the Parthians war were kept back, the state was in arms.

Quonam haec omnia nisi ad suam perniciem pertinere? 

 What for, unless all these things led to his ruin?

Sed tamen ad omnia se descendere paratum atque omnia pati rei publicae causa.

 But nevertheless he was ready to lower himself to all of it, and to suffer even
 all this for the sake of the republic.

Proficiscatur Pompeius in suas provincias, ipsi exercitus dimittant, discedant
in Italia omnes ab armis, metus e civitate tollatur, libera comitia atque omnis
res publica senatui populoque Romano permittatur.

 Let Pompei depart into his provinces, let them dismiss the armies,
 let everyone in Italy down arms, let fear be lifted from the city,
 let free elections and all the republic be allowed for the senate and
 Roman people.

Haec quo facilius certisque condicionibus fiant et iureiurando sanciantur, aut
ipse propius accedat aut se patiatur accedere:

 Therefore let these things be more easily done by fixed agreements and be
 confirmed by an oath, let either he himself approach Pompey, or let Pompey
 suffer himself to aproach Caesar:

fore uti per colloquia omnes controversiae componantur.

 so that all disputes might be settled through dialog.
