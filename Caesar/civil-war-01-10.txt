Book I section [10] 

Acceptis mandatis Roscius cum L. Caesare Capuam pervenit ibique consules
Pompeiumque invenit; postulata Caesaris renuntiat. Illi deliberata re respondent
scriptaque ad eum mandata per eos remittunt; quorum haec erat summa: Caesar in
Galliam reverteretur, Arimino excederet, exercitus dimitteret; quae si fecisset,
Pompeium in Hispanias iturum. Interea, quoad fides esset data Caesarem facturum,
quae polliceretur, non intermissuros consules Pompeiumque delectus.

Roscius, having accepted the commision reached Capua along with L. Caesar,
and finds the consuls and Pompey there.  He announces Caesar's demands.
They reply in a deliberate manner and send back written things to him 
ordered by them; of which these are the foremost things; let Caesar return to
Gaul, pass by Ariminus, disband his army; if these things had been done,
Pompey would march into Spain.  In the meantime, as long as he'd be loyal gifts
would be given to Caesar, he would promise these things, not having chosen the
interrupted consuls and Pompey.
