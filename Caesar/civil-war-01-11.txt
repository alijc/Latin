Erat iniqua condicio postulare, ut Caesar Arimino excederet atque in
provinciam reverteretur, ipsum et provincias et legiones alienas
tenere; exercitum Caesaris velle dimitti, delectus habere; polliceri
se in provinciam iturum neque, ante quem diem iturus sit, definire,
ut, si peracto consulatu Caesar profectus esset, nulla tamen mendacii
religione obstrictus videretur; tempus vero colloquio non dare neque
accessurum polliceri magnam pacis desperationem afferebat.  Itaque ab
Arimino M. Antonium cum cohortibus V Arretium mittit; ipse Arimini cum
duabus subsistit ibique delectum habere instituit; Pisaurum, Fanum,
Anconam singulis cohortibua occupat.


It was an unfair proposition to demand that Caesar should withdraw from
Ariminum and return to his province, while Pompey was keeping another's
provinces and legions; wishing to dismiss Caesar's army, while Pompey
was holding levies; promising that Pompey should go to his province
without setting the day when he should leave, so that, if on the
completion of his consulship Caeser had departed, he would still seem
to be bound with no sanction of falsehood; setting no time for a
genuine conference and not offering to approach bore a great despair
for peace.  And so he sends M. Antonius from Ariminum to Arretium,
along with 5 cohorts; he himself stays in Ariminum with two and there
arranges to hold a levy; he occupies Pisaurum, Fanum, Ancona with a
cohort apiece.
