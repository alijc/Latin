Erat iniqua condicio postulare, ut Caesar Arimino excederet atque in provinciam
 reverteretur, ipsum et provincias et legiones alienas tenere;
 exercitum Caesaris velle dimitti, delectus habere;
 polliceri se in provinciam iturum neque, ante quem diem iturus sit, definire,
 ut, si peracto consulatu Caesar profectus esset,
 nulla tamen mendacii religione obstrictus videretur;
 tempus vero colloquio non dare neque accessurum polliceri magnam pacis
 desperationem afferebat.
 Itaque ab Arimino M. Antonium cum cohortibus V Arretium mittit;
 ipse Arimini cum duabus subsistit ibique delectum habere instituit;
 Pisaurum, Fanum, Anconam singulis cohortibua occupat.


It was with an unfair proposition to demand that Caesar should withdraw from
Ariminum and return to his province, as he himself (Pompey?) was causing
the keeping of another's provinces and legions;
the wish to dismiss Caesar's army, holding the levies;
promising that he himself should go to his province and did not,
before that day when he might go, 
settling it so that, if Caeser had departed with a disrupted consulship,
nevertheless the obligated one might be seen with no sanction of falsehood;
not giving time for a genuine conversation and should not approach 
was conveying/reporting to promise a great desparate act of peace.
And so he sends M. Antonius from Ariminum along with V Arretius;
he himself (of Ariminum) stands with two and there sets up to hold a levy;
he occupies Pisaurum, Fanum, Ancona with two cohorts apiece.
