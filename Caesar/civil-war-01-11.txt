Erat iniqua condicio postulare, ut Caesar Arimino excederet atque in provinciam
 reverteretur, ipsum et provincias et legiones alienas tenere;
 exercitum Caesaris velle dimitti, delectus habere;
 polliceri se in provinciam iturum neque, ante quem diem iturus sit, definire,
 ut, si peracto consulatu Caesar profectus esset,
 nulla tamen mendacii religione obstrictus videretur;
 tempus vero colloquio non dare neque accessurum polliceri magnam pacis
 desperationem afferebat.
 Itaque ab Arimino M. Antonium cum cohortibus V Arretium mittit;
 ipse Arimini cum duabus subsistit ibique delectum habere instituit;
 Pisaurum, Fanum, Anconam singulis cohortibua occupat.


It was with an unfair agreement to demand, that Caesar should withdraw from
Ariminum and return to his province, as he himself (Pompey?) held another's
provinces and legions;
to wish to dismiss Caesar's army, selected to have;
to promise himself that he should go o the province and not,
before that day when he might go, to define/end/settle,
so that, if with a disruptted consulship Caeser might have departe,
nevertheless with no sanction of falsehood the obligated one might seem;
time, by genuine converstion, not to give and should not approach 
was conveying/reporting to promise a great desparate act of peace.
And so he sends M. Antonius from Ariminum along with V Arretius;
he himself (of Ariminum) stands with two and there sets up to hold the chosen;
he occupies Pisaurum, Fanum, Ancona with two cohorts apiece.
