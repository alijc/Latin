Book I section[12] 

Interea certior factus Iguvium Thermum praetorem cohortibus V tenere,
 oppidum munire, omniumque esse Iguvinorum optimam erga se voluntatem,
 Curionem cum tribus cohortibus, quas Pisauri et Arimini habebat, mittit.

Cuius adventu cognito diffisus municipii voluntati Thermus cohortes ex urbe
reducit et profugit. 

Milites in itinere ab eo discedunt ac domum revertuntur. 

Curio summa omnium voluntate Iguvium recepit. 

Quibus rebus cognitis confisus municipiorum voluntatibus Caesar cohortes
 legionis XIII ex praesidiis deducit Auximumque proficiscitur;
 quod oppidum Attius cohortibus introductis tenebat delectumque
 toto Piceno circummissis senatoribus habebat. 

Meanwhile, having made sure that Iguvius, the judge of the hot baths held five
cohorts, to fortify the town, and of all the Iguviuses to be of the best good
well towards him, he sent Curio with three cohorts, which he was holding at Pisa
and Arminius.

Having learned of whose arrival, Thermus, dispairing of the town's good will,
pulled the cohortes out of the city and fled.

The soldiers on route marched away from him and returned home.

Curio recovered Iguvius with the greatest goodwill of all.

Who, having learned these things, Caesar, with confidence in the town's
goodwill, led the cohorts of the 8th legion out of the garrison and departed for
Auximum;  
because Attius, having brought in cohorts, was holding the town
and was having a levy throughout Piceee, having sent around to the senators.
