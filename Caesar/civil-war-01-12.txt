Interea certior factus Iguvium Thermum praetorem cohortibus V tenere,
oppidum munire, omniumque esse Iguvinorum optimam erga se voluntatem,
Curionem cum tribus cohortibus, quas Pisauri et Arimini habebat, mittit.
Cuius adventu cognito diffisus municipii voluntati Thermus cohortes ex
urbe reducit et profugit.  Milites in itinere ab eo discedunt ac domum
revertuntur.  Curio summa omnium voluntate Iguvium recepit.  Quibus
rebus cognitis confisus municipiorum voluntatibus Caesar cohortes
legionis XIII ex praesidiis deducit Auximumque proficiscitur; quod
oppidum Attius cohortibus introductis tenebat delectumque toto Piceno
circummissis senatoribus habebat.

Meanwhile, having determined that Iguvium contained Thermus the praetor,
with five cohorts to fortify the town, and that all of the Iguviumians
were of the best goodwill towards him, he sent Curio with three cohorts
that he had at Pisa and Arminius.  And having learned of his arrival,
Thermus, dispairing of the town's good will, pulled his cohorts out of
the city and fled.  When soldiers were on the road they marched away
from him and returned home.  Curio recovered Iguvium with the greatest
goodwill of all.  And when he had learned these things, Caesar,
confident in the town's goodwill, led the cohorts of the 8th legion out
of the garrison and departed for Auximum; which town Attius held, having
brought in cohorts, and was holding a levy throughout Picenum, having
sent senators around.
