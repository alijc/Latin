Adventu Caesaris cognito decuriones Auximi ad Attium Varum frequentes
conveniunt; docent sui iudicii rem non esse; neque se neque reliquos
municipes pati posse C. Caesarem imperatorem, bene de re publica
meritum, tantis rebus gestis oppido moenibusque prohiberi; proinde
habeat rationem posteritatis et periculi sui. Quorum oratione
permotus Varus praesidium, quod introduxerat, ex oppido educit ac
profugit. Hunc ex primo ordine pauci Caesaris consecuti milites
consistere coegerunt. Commisso proelio deseritur a suis Varus;
nonnulla pars militum domum discedit; reliqui ad Caesarem perveniunt,
atque una cum eis deprensus L. Pupius, primi pili centurio,
adducitur, qui hunc eundem ordinem in exercitu Cn. Pompei antea
duxerat. At Caesar milites Attianos collaudat, Pupium dimittit,
Auximatibus agit gratias seque eorum facti memorem fore pollicetur.

On learning of Caesar's arrival, the decurions of Auximun come
together to Attius Varus repeatedly.  They point out that the matter
of their court/judgment is not; neither they nor the rest of the
citizenry can endure C Caesar commander in chief, well deserved of
the republic, such great things having been carried out to forbid
fortifications to the town; hence he/it had an reason of posterity
and of the danger of his of those who by speech.

Of those who by speech Varus was deeply moved, the garrison that he
had brought in, he led back out of the town and escaped/ran away.

A few soldiers of Caesar's first rank forced him to stop.
After committing to battle Varus is abandoned by him(self?);
a few parties of soldiers march off home;
the rest come to Caesar, and one of these was found to be L Pupius,
first centurion of the legion,
he was led to/away, who had formerly commanded that selfsame class in the
army of Gn Pompey.
But Caesar extolled the Attian soldiers, sent Pupius away,
gave thanks to the Auximians and promises that he will be of them
made mindful.
