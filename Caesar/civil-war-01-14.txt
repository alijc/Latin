Quibus rebus Romam nuntiatis tantus repente terror invasit,
 ut cum Lentulus consul ad aperiendum aerarium venisset
 ad pecuniamque Pompeio ex senatusconsulto proferendam,
 protinus aperto sanctiore aerario ex urbe profugeret. 

When these things had been reported to Rome a great panic suddenly engulfed it,
in order that when consul Lentulus had come to open the treasury
and to advance payment to Pompey by the decree of the senate,
having immediately opened the consecrated treasury he fled the city.


Caesar enim adventare iam iamque et adesse eius equites falso nuntiabantur. 

For it was reported, falsely, that Caesar had already approached and that his
cavalry was near at hand.


Hunc Marcellus collega et plerique magistratus consecuti sunt. 

His colleage Marcellus and most of the magistracy followed him.


Cn. Pompeius pridie eius diei ex urbe profectus iter ad legiones habebat,
 quas a Caesare acceptas in Apulia hibernorum causa disposuerat. 

The previous day, Gnaeus Pompey, having set out from the city made a journey to
the legions, which having been received by Caesar in Apulia, he posted for the
sake of the Irish.


Delectus circa urbem intermittuntur;
 nihil citra Capuam tutum esse omnibus videtur. 

The levies going on around the city were interrupted.


Capuae primum se confirmant et colligunt delectumque colonorum,
 qui lege Iulia Capuam deducti erant, habere instituunt;
 gladiatoresque, quos ibi Caesar in ludo habebat,
 ad forum productos Lentulus spe libertatis confirmat
 atque iis equos attribuit et se sequi iussit;
 quos postea monitus ab suis,
 quod ea res omnium iudicio reprehendebatur,
 circum familias conventus Campani custodiae causa distribuit.

To Capua first they strengthen themselves and muster the draft of the farmers,
who had been diverted by law by Julia to Capua, they set up to have;
and gladiators, whom Caesar had there in sport,
led on to the forum Lentulus confirms the hope liberty
and assign(s/ed) horses to them and order(s/ed) them to follow:
whom afterwards warned by his men,
that the matter of all was held back by legal action,
he distributed around the families the agreement of Campainius on account of the
protection.
