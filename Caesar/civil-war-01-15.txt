Book I section[15] 

Auximo Caesar progressus omnem agrum Picenum percurrit. 

 Caesar, after advancing to Auximum, overran the entire district of Picenum.


Cunctae earum regionum praefecturae libentissimis animis eum recipiunt
exercitumque eius omnibus rebus iuvant. 

 Each of the prefectures of the region received him most willingly
 and assisted his army in all things.


Etiam Cingulo, quod oppidum Labienus constituerat suaque pecunia
exaedificaverat, ad eum legati veniunt quaeque imperaverit se cupidissime
facturos pollicentur. Milites imperat: mittunt. 

 Even from Cingulum, the town that Labienus had established and 
 constructed with his own money, envoys came to him and
 promised that they would do whatever he commanded.
 He ordered the soldiers: They sent/released.


Interea legio XII Caesarem consequitur. 

 Meanwhile the 12th legion followed Caesar.


Cum his duabus Asculum Picenum proficiscitur. 

 He departed Asculum Picenum with these two (legions?).


Id oppidum Lentulus Spinther X cohortibus tenebat;
 qui Caesaris adventu cognito profugit ex oppido cohortesque secum abducere
 conatus magna parte militum deseritur. 

Lentulus Spinther held the town with 10 cohorts;
 but he fled from the town when he learned of Caesar's arrival 
 and after attempting to lead the cohorts away with him,
 was cut off, along with a large part of his soldiers.


Relictus in itinere cum paucis incidit in Vibullium Rufum missum a Pompeio in
agrum Picenum confirmandorum hominum causa. 

 Left behind on the road with only a few (men) he happened upon Vibullius Rufus,
 sent from Pompey into the district of Picenum for the sake of supporting 
 the men.


A quo factus Vibullius certior, quae res in Piceno gererentur, milites ab eo
accipit, ipsum dimittit. 

 And this made Vibullius more certain about what was going on in Picenum, 
 so he took his soldiers and dismissed him.

Item ex finitimis regionibus quas potest contrahit cohortes ex delectibus
 Pompeianis;
 in his Camerino fugientem Lucilium Hirrum cum sex cohortibus, quas ibi in
 praesidio habuerat, excipit;
 quibus coactis XII efficit. 

 Likewise, he assembled from the neighboring regions, where he was able,
 cohorts of Pompey's choosing;
 with these he withdrew to Camerinus Lucilius Hirrus,
 who had fled with the six cohorts that he had had there in the garrison.

Cum his ad Domitium Ahenobarbum Corfinium magnis itineribus pervenit Caesaremque
adesse cum legionibus duabus nuntiat. 

 With these he came to Domitius Ahenobarbus Corfinius after a long journey
 and announced that Caesar was near at hand with two legions.

Domitius per se circiter XX cohortes Alba, ex Marsis et Paelignis, finitimis ab
regionibus coegerat.  

 Domitius rounded up for himself about 20 cohorts Alba,
 from the Marsi and Peligni, which bordered those regions.
