 qui ab eo discesserant, delectumque institui iubet;
 ipse unum diem ibi rei frumentariae causa moratus Corfinium contendit. 

After taking Firmus in and driving Lentulus out,
Caesar gave orders that the soldiers who had desserted him be hunted down
and that a draft be set up; he himself delayed there in Corfinium for a day for
the sake of his supply of grain. 


Eo cum venisset, cohortes V praemissae a Domitio ex oppido pontem fluminis
interrumpebant, qui erat ab oppido milia passuum circiter III. 

When he'd gotten there, the five cohorts that had been sent ahead from the town
 by Domitius were breaking up the bridge over the river, which was about three

Ibi cum antecursoribus Caesaris proelio commisso celeriter Domitiani a ponte
repulsi se in oppidum receperunt. 

There when to/by Caesar's scouts to/by the battle having been engaged rapidly
Domitius' men were repulsed from the bridge they recovered the town.
