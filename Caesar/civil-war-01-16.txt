Book I section [16] 

Recepto Firmo expulsoque Lentulo Caesar conquiri milites,
 qui ab eo discesserant, delectumque institui iubet;
 ipse unum diem ibi rei frumentariae causa moratus Corfinium contendit. 

After driving Lentulus out and retaking Firmum,
Caesar gave orders that the soldiers who had desserted him be hunted down
and that a draft be set up; he himself strained to reach Corfinium in a day for
the sake of its grain supply. 


Eo cum venisset, cohortes V praemissae a Domitio ex oppido pontem fluminis
interrumpebant, qui erat ab oppido milia passuum circiter III. 

When he'd gotten there, the five cohorts that had been sent ahead from the town
 by Domitius were breaking up the bridge over the river, which was about three
 miles from the town.


Ibi cum antecursoribus Caesaris proelio commisso celeriter Domitiani a ponte
repulsi se in oppidum receperunt. 

After Caesar's vanguard had swiftly engaged a battle and
Domitius' men were repulsed from the bridge, they recovered the town.


Caesar legionibus transductis ad oppidum constitit iuxtaque murum castra posuit.

Caesar, having led the legions across to the town, took a position and pitched
camp beside the town wall.
