Book I section [16] 

Recepto Firmo expulsoque Lentulo Caesar conquiri milites, qui ab eo
discesserant, delectumque institui iubet; ipse unum diem ibi rei
frumentariae causa moratus Corfinium contendit.  Eo cum venisset,
cohortes V praemissae a Domitio ex oppido pontem fluminis
interrumpebant, qui erat ab oppido milia passuum circiter III.  Ibi cum
antecursoribus Caesaris proelio commisso celeriter Domitiani a ponte
repulsi se in oppidum receperunt.  Caesar legionibus transductis ad
oppidum constitit iuxtaque murum castra posuit.


After driving Lentulus out and retaking Firmum, Caesar gave orders that
the soldiers who had desserted him be hunted down and that a draft be
set up; he himself, having delayed there for a day for the sake of his
grain supply, extended himself to reach Corfinium.  When he'd gotten
there, the five cohorts that had been sent ahead from the town by
Domitius were breaking up a bridge over the river, which was about
three miles from the town.  When Caesar's vanguard engaged battle, 
Domitius' men were swiftly repulsed from the bridge and withdrew into
the town.  Caesar, having led the legions across to the town, took a
position and pitched camp beside the town wall.
