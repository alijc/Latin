Re cognita Domitius ad Pompeium in Apuliam peritos regionum magno
proposito praemio cum litteris mittit, qui petant atque orent, ut
sibi subveniat: Caesarem duobus exercitibus et locorum angustiis
facile intercludi posse frumentoque prohiberi.  Quod nisi fecerit,
se cohortesque amplius XXX magnumque numerum senatorum atque
equitum Romanorum in periculum esse venturum.  Interim suos
cohortatus tormenta in muris disponit certasque cuique partes ad
custodiam urbis attribuit; militibus in contione agros ex suis
possessionibus pollicetur, quaterna in singulos iugera, et pro
rata parte centurionibus evocatisque.


When he learns of this business, Domitius uses the proposal of a
large reward to send knowledgeable local men with a letter to
Pompey in Apulia, entreating and begging him to come to his aid:
writing that Caesar could easily be cut off and prevented from
resupplying with two armies on account of the narrow passages of
the region.  That unless he did so, he and more than 30 cohorts
and a great number of senators and knights of Rome would come to
be in danger.  Meanwhile, having encouraged his men, he disposes
war machines on the walls and assigns individual posts to the city
watch; he promises the assembled soldiers fields, out of his own
property, amounting to 2 1/2 acres apiece, and proportionally to
the centurions and veterans.
