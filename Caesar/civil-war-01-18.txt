Interim Caesari nuntiatur Sulmonenses,
 quod oppidum a Corfinio VII milium intervallo abest,
 cupere ea facere, quae vellet,
 sed a Q. Lucretio senatore et Attio Peligno prohiberi,
 qui id oppidum VII cohortium praesidio tenebant. 

In the meantime it is reported to Caesar the Sulmones....
 that the town was 7 miles away from Corfinium,
 to desire to do these things, that he might want,
 but to be restrained by Senator Q. Lucretius and Attius Pelignus,
 who held the town with the aid of 7 cohorts.

Mittit eo M. Antonium cum legionis XIII cohortibus V. Sulmonenses simul
 atque signa nostra viderunt,
 portas aperuerunt universique, et oppidani et milites,
 obviam gratulantes Antonio exierunt. 

He sends by him M. Antonius with 8 cohorts of the legion V Sulmonenses
 at the same time as they see our battle standard,
 they open all of the gates , both civilians and soldiers,
 sallying forth to give thanks to Antonius on the road.

Lucretius et Attius de muro se deiecerunt. 

 Lucretius and Attius threw themselves down from the wall.

Attius ad Antonium deductus petit ut ad Caesarem mitteretur. 

 Attius, having been taken to Antonius, asked that he be sent to Caesar.

Antonius cum cohortibus et Attio eodem die, quo profectus erat, revertitur. 

 Antonius returned with the cohorts and with Attius, who had departed that same
 day. 

Caesar eas cohortes cum exercitu suo coniunxit Attiumque incolumem dimisit. 

 Caesar joined the cohorts up with his army and sent Attius away unharmed.

Caesar primis diebus castra magnis operibus munire et ex finitimis municipiis
frumentum comportare reliquasque copias exspectare instituit. 

 During the next few days Caesar prepared to strengthen the camp with extensive
 fortifications, to bring in crops from the surrounding area, and to wait
 for the rest of his supplies.

Eo triduo legio VIII ad eum venit cohortesque ex novis Galliae dilectibus XXII
equitesque ab rege Norico circiter CCC. 

 In three days the 8th legion and 22 cohorts came to him from a new levy from
 Gaul and around 300 horsemen from King Noricus.

Quorum adventu altera castra ad alteram oppidi partem ponit;
 his castris Curionem praefecit. 

 Upon their arrival he placed a second camp on the other side of the town;
  he put Curiones in charge of these camps.

Reliquis diebus oppidum vallo castellisque circummunire instituit. 

 For the remaining days he prepared to invest the town with a wall and
 redoubts. 

Cuius operis maxima parte effecta eodem fere tempore missi a Pompeio
revertuntur. 

 Whose fortifications by the greatest part brought about by the same nearly time
 as a messenger returned from Pompey.
