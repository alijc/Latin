Book I section [19] 

Litteris perlectis Domitius dissimulans in consilio pronuntiat Pompeium
celeriter subsidio venturum hortaturque eos, ne animo deficiant quaeque usui ad
defendendum oppidum sint parent. 

 Having read over the letter, Domitius hiding in the plan pronounced Pompey
 quickly by help about to come and encouraged them not to let their spirits
 fail, whatever to advantage to defending the town they might be ????


Ipse arcano cum paucis familiaribus suis colloquitur consiliumque fugae capere
constituit. 

 He himself, in secret, speaks with a few members of his household, and the
 council and prepares to take flight.

Cum vultus Domiti cum oratione non consentiret, atque omnia trepidantius
timidiusque ageret, quam superioribus diebus consuesset, multumque cum suis
consiliandi causa secreto praeter consuetudinem colloqueretur, concilia
conventusque hominum fugeret, res diutius tegi dissimularique non potuit. 

 Since Domitius' face did not agree with his speech, and in all respects he
 acted with more trembling and fearfulness, than he'd been wont to in recent
 days, and conversing much with his men taking counsel on account of secretly
 contrary to the experience.

Pompeius enim rescripserat: sese rem in summum periculum deducturum non esse,
 neque suo consilio aut voluntate Domitium se in oppidum Corfinium contulisse;
 proinde, si qua fuisset facultas, ad se cum omnibus copiis veniret. 

 For Pompey had written in reply: that he was not about to be drawn into the
 greatest danger, nor by his plan or desire Domitius to collect himself in the
 town of Corfinium; so then, if it had been by what means, he himself would have
 come with all of his troops.

Id ne fieri posset, obsidione atque oppidi circummunitione fiebat.

 It could not be done, it was happening with the siege and the investing of the
 town.
