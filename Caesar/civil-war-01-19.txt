Book I section [19] 

Litteris perlectis Domitius dissimulans in consilio pronuntiat Pompeium
celeriter subsidio venturum hortaturque eos, ne animo deficiant quaeque usui ad
defendendum oppidum sint parent. 

 Having read the letter through, Domitius hiding in the counsel announces that
 Pompey will soon arrive with aid and encourages them not to let their spirits
 flag and to prepare whatever they could use for defending the town.


Ipse arcano cum paucis familiaribus suis colloquitur consiliumque fugae capere
constituit. 

 He himself speaks secretly with a few members of his household and readies a
 plan to take flight.


Cum vultus Domiti cum oratione non consentiret, atque omnia trepidantius
timidiusque ageret, quam superioribus diebus consuesset, multumque cum suis
consiliandi causa secreto praeter consuetudinem colloqueretur, concilia
conventusque hominum fugeret, res diutius tegi dissimularique non potuit. 

 Since Domitius' demeanor did not match his speech, and in all respects he
 acted with more trembling and fearfulness than he'd been wont to in
 recent days, and took much counsel in secret with his men, and
 avoided the councils and gatherings of people, which was a matter that
 he could not conceal for very long.

Pompeius enim rescripserat: sese rem in summum periculum deducturum non esse,
 neque suo consilio aut voluntate Domitium se in oppidum Corfinium contulisse;
 proinde, si qua fuisset facultas, ad se cum omnibus copiis veniret. 

 For Pompey had written in reply: that he was not about to be drawn into
 the greatest danger, nor by his plan or desire to join Domitius in the
 town of Corfinium; and so, had there been any means whatsoever, he himself
 would have come with all of his troops.

Id ne fieri posset, obsidione atque oppidi circummunitione fiebat.

 It could not be done, it was happening with the siege and the investing of the
 town.
