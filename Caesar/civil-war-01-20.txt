Book I section [20] 

Divulgato Domiti consilio milites, qui erant Corfinii, prima
vesperi secessionem faciunt atque ita inter se per tribunos
militum centurionesque atque honestissimos sui generis
colloquuntur: obsideri se a Caesare, opera munitionesque
prope esse perfectas; ducem suum Domitium, cuius spe atque
fiducia permanserint, proiectis omnibus fugae consilium
capere: debere se suae salutis rationem habere.  Ab his
primo Marsi dissentire incipiunt eamque oppidi partem, quae
munitissima videretur, occupant, tantaque inter eos
dissensio exsistit, ut manum conserere atque armis dimicare
conentur; post paulo tamen internuntiis ultro citroque
missis quae ignorabant, de L. Domiti fuga, cognoscunt.
Itaque omnes uno consilio Domitium productum in publicum
circumsistunt et custodiunt legatosque ex suo numero ad
Caesarem mittunt: sese paratos esse portas aperire, quaeque
imperaverit facere et L. Domitium vivum in eius potestati
tradere.



When the soldiers in Corfinium catch wind of Domitius' plan,
they get together the next evening and say this among
themselves, through the soldiers' tribunes and centurions
and the most distinguished of their rank: that they were
besieged by Caesar, whose works and fortifications were
nearly complete: that their leader Domitius, by whose
expectation and confidence they were to hold out, had thrown
them all away to seize a plan of flight: that they ought to
have regard for their own safety.  At first the Marsi start
out disagreeing with this, and they occupy the part of the
town which seemed to be most defendable, and thus a quarrel
breaks out among them, so that they try to join a band and
to contend with arms; but after a little while, when
intermediaries had been sent ovet to the side that didn't
know, they become aware of the flight of L Domitius.  And so
they all surround Domitius, who had been led out, with a
single common resolution and guard him, and send legates of
their number to Caesar: that they were prepared to open the
gates, do whatever he commanded and to hand over
L. Domitius, alive, into his power.
