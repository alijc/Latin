Book I section [21] 

Quibus rebus cognitis Caesar, 
etsi magni interesse arbitrabatur quam primum oppido potiri cohortesque ad se in
castra traducere, 
ne qua aut largitionibus aut animi confirmatione aut falsis nuntiis commutatio
fieret voluntatis, 
quod saepe in bello parvis momentis magni casus intercederent, tamen veritus, 
ne militum introitu et nocturni temporis licentia oppidum diriperetur, 
eos, qui venerant, collaudat atque in oppidum dimittit, 
portas murosque adservari iubet. 

After Caesar learned of these matters,
although (of)great(s) he/it was considered to be in between 
than at first to gain possession by the town and cohorts to self to bring across
into the camp,
lest by which/where/by which route either by bribery or by firmness of mind
or by false messengers a reversal might be done of wills,
that/because often in war by a small effort great fortunes may come between,
yet feared,
lest by the soldier's entrance and disorder of night the town might be
plundered,
he commends those who had come and sends them away into the town,
and orders the gates and walls to be guarded.

Ipse eis operibus, quae facere instituerat, 
milites disponit non certis spatiis intermissis, 
ut erat superiorum dierum consuetudo, sed perpetuis vigiliis stationibusque, 
ut contingant inter se atque omnem munitionem expleant; 
tribunos militum et praefectos circummittit atque hortatur, 
non solum ab eruptionibus caveant, 
sed etiam singulorum hominum occultos exitus adservent. 

He himself, by/to the fortifications that he had prepared to build,
posts soldiers not by fixed spaces interrupted,
as the normal practice in previous days was,
but by/to a continuous watches and outposts,
so that they touch between themselves and fill out the whole fortification;
he sends around and encourages the soldiers' tribunes and commanders,
not only that they might take defense against sorties,
but also of each man that they might observe/guard the hidden exits.


Neque vero tam remisso ac languido animo quisquam omnium fuit, 
qui ea nocte conquieverit. 

And not truly so having sent back and with a faint spirit anyone was each,
who took rest in the night.

Tanta erat summae rerum exspectatio, 
ut alius in aliam partem mente atque animo traheretur, 
quid ipsis Corfiniensibus, 
quid Domitio, quid Lentulo, quid reliquis accideret, 
qui quosque eventus exciperent.

There was such a high exspectation of things,
that each into another part was drawn in mind and spirit,
that by they themselves, from Corfinium,
that by Domitius, that by Lentulus, what might befall the rest,
those who would follow whichever outcomes.
