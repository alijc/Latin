Book I section [21] 

Quibus rebus cognitis Caesar, 
etsi magni interesse arbitrabatur quam primum oppido potiri cohortesque ad se in
castra traducere, 
ne qua aut largitionibus aut animi confirmatione aut falsis nuntiis commutatio
fieret voluntatis, 
quod saepe in bello parvis momentis magni casus intercederent, tamen veritus, 
ne militum introitu et nocturni temporis licentia oppidum diriperetur, 
eos, qui venerant, collaudat atque in oppidum dimittit, 
portas murosque adservari iubet. 

After Caesar learned of these matters,
although (of)great(s) he considered to lie between 
than at first to gain possession by the town and to lead the cohorts 
into his camp,
lest a change of mind be brought about on that side, 
either by bribery or by firmness of will or by false messages.
because in war often great fortunes may come between with smalls efforts,
yet fearing that the town would be destroyed
by the entrance of the soldier and the disorder of night,
he commends those who had come and sends them away into the town,
and orders the gates and walls to be guarded.

Ipse eis operibus, quae facere instituerat, 
milites disponit non certis spatiis intermissis, 
ut erat superiorum dierum consuetudo, sed perpetuis vigiliis stationibusque, 
ut contingant inter se atque omnem munitionem expleant; 
tribunos militum et praefectos circummittit atque hortatur, 
non solum ab eruptionibus caveant, 
sed etiam singulorum hominum occultos exitus adservent. 

He himself posts soldiers along the fortifications that he had caused to be erected,
not at fixed intervals, as the normal practice had been heretofore,
but in continuous watches and outposts,
so that they touch between themselves and fill out the whole fortification;
he sends around and encourages the soldiers' tribunes and commanders,
not only that they might guard against sorties,
but also of each man that they might watch for undercover eqresses.


Neque vero tam remisso ac languido animo quisquam omnium fuit, 
qui ea nocte conquieverit. 

And not truly so having sent back and with a faint spirit anyone was each,
who took rest in the night.

Tanta erat summae rerum exspectatio, 
ut alius in aliam partem mente atque animo traheretur, 
quid ipsis Corfiniensibus, 
quid Domitio, quid Lentulo, quid reliquis accideret, 
qui quosque eventus exciperent.

There was such a high exspectation of things,
that each into another part was drawn in mind and spirit,
what would befall the Corfinians themselves,
Domitius, Lentulus, and everyone else,
those who would follow whichever outcomes.
