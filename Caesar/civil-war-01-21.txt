Book I section [21] 

Quibus rebus cognitis Caesar, etsi magni interesse
arbitrabatur quam primum oppido potiri cohortesque ad se in
castra traducere, ne qua aut largitionibus aut animi
confirmatione aut falsis nuntiis commutatio fieret
voluntatis, quod saepe in bello parvis momentis magni casus
intercederent, tamen veritus, ne militum introitu et
nocturni temporis licentia oppidum diriperetur, eos, qui
venerant, collaudat atque in oppidum dimittit, portas
murosque adservari iubet.  Ipse eis operibus, quae facere
instituerat, milites disponit non certis spatiis
intermissis, ut erat superiorum dierum consuetudo, sed
perpetuis vigiliis stationibusque, ut contingant inter se
atque omnem munitionem expleant; tribunos militum et
praefectos circummittit atque hortatur, non solum ab
eruptionibus caveant, sed etiam singulorum hominum occultos
exitus adservent.  Neque vero tam remisso ac languido animo
quisquam omnium fuit, qui ea nocte conquieverit.  Tanta erat
summae rerum exspectatio, ut alius in aliam partem mente
atque animo traheretur, quid ipsis Corfiniensibus, quid
Domitio, quid Lentulo, quid reliquis accideret, qui quosque
eventus exciperent.


After Caesar learned of these matters, he
considered it to be of great importance to gain possession
of the town as quickly as possible and to draw the cohorts
over into his camp, lest a change of mind be brought about
on that side, either by bribery or by firmness of will or by
false messages, because in war great fortunes may often come
to pass from small efforts.  But he feared that the town
would be plundered by the entry of his soldiers in the
disorder of night, so he commends those who had come and
sends them back into the town, and orders the gates and
walls to be guarded.  He himself posts soldiers along the
fortifications that he had caused to be erected, not at
fixed intervals, as his practice had been heretofore, but in
continuous watches and outposts, so that they are adjacent
to each other and fill out the whole fortification; he sends
the soldiers' tribunes and commanders around and charges
them, not only that to guard against sorties, but also to
watch for individual escapes.  And indeed, so unrelaxed and
unsluggish was every man that no one took rest that night.
There was such a high expectation of events, that each man
was drawn off in mind and spirit; what would happen to the
Corfinians themselves, and Domitius, and Lentulus, and
everyone else, which outcomes would follow from which.
