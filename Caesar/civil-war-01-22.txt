Quarta vigilia circiter Lentulus Spinther de muro cum vigiliis
custodibusque nostris colloquitur; velle, si sibi fiat potestas,
Caesarem convenire.  Facta potestate ex oppido mittitur, neque ab eo
prius Domitiani milites discedunt, quam in conspectum Caesaris
deducatur.  Cum eo de salute sua agit, orat atque obsecrat, ut sibi
parcat, veteremque amicitiam commemorat Caesarisque in se beneficia
exponit; quae erant maxima: quod per eum in collegium pontificum
venerat, quod provinciam Hispaniam ex praetura habuerat, quod in
petitione consulatus erat sublevatus.  Cuius orationem Caesar
interpellat: se non maleficii causa ex provincia egressum, sed uti se a
contumeliis inimicorum defenderet, ut tribunos plebis in ea re ex
civitate expulsos in suam dignitatem restitueret, ut se et populum
Romanum factione paucorum oppressum in libertatem vindicaret.  Cuius
oratione confirmatus Lentulus, ut in oppidum reverti liceat, petit:
quod de sua salute impetraverit, fore etiam reliquis ad suam spem
solatio; adeo esse perterritos nonnullos, ut suae vitae durius
consulere cogantur.  Facta potestate discedit.


At around the fourth watch Lentulus Spinther, from the wall, converses
with our sentries and guards; that he wishes, if at all possible, to
come and meet with Caesar.  The opportunity having been granted, he is
sent from the town, and Domitius' soldiers do not leave him until he is
escorted into Caesar's presence.  He speaks with him about his safety,
he begs and entreats that he be spared, and mentions their old
friendship and relates Caesar's favors to himself, which were great:
that he had come into the college of high priests with his aid, that he
had held the province of Spain after his praetorship, that he had been
raised up into the consulship by his candidacy.  Caesar interrupts his
speech, saying that he had not marched out of the province for the sake
of a crime, but in order to defend himself from the affronts of his
enemies, to restore the peoples' tribunes back into their position
after their expulsion from the city, to vindicate himself and the Roman
people, suppressed in their liberty by a faction of the elite.
Encouraged by this speech Lentulus asks that he might be permitted to
return to the town: since he had obtained his own safety, it would also
be, for the others, the consolation of their own hope; precisely that
there were some men terrified enough to be forced to look out roughly
for their own lives.  The opportunity having been granted, he
withdraws.
