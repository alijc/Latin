Book I section [24] 

Pompeius his rebus cognitis, quae erant ad Corfinium gestae,
 Luceria proficiscitur Canusium atque inde Brundisium. 

When Pompey learns of what had been done at Corfinium,
he departs from Luceria to Canusium and from there to Brundisium.
 

Copias undique omnes ex novis dilectibus ad se cogi iubet;
 servos, pastores armat atque eis equos attribuit;
 ex his circiter CCC equites conficit. 

He orders troops from new levies from the country round to assemble to him;
he arms slaves and shepherds and distributes horses to them;
out of these he readies about 300 cavalry.

L. Manlius praetor Alba cum cohortibus sex profugit,
 Rutilius Lupus praetor Tarracina cum tribus;
 quae procul equitatum Caesaris conspicatae, cui praeerat Vibius Curius,
 relicto praetore signa ad Curium transferunt atque ad eum transeunt. 

Praetor L Manlius escapes Alba with six cohorts, 
and Praetor Rutilius Lupus Tarracina with three;
which having sighted in the distance Caesar's cavalry, 
commanded by Vibius Curius,
by the remaining praetor they carry the battle standard to Curius
and go over to him.

Item reliquis itineribus nonnullae cohortes in agmen Caesaris,
 aliae in equites incidunt. 

Likewise, by the remaining journeys several cohorts reach Caesar's train,
 and others his cavalry.

Reducitur ad eum deprensus ex itinere N. Magius Cremona, praefectus fabrum
Cn. Pompei. 

He leads N. Magius Cremona back to him, seized from the road, put in charge
of the workers of Cn. Pompey.

Quem Caesar ad eum remittit cum mandatis:
 quoniam ad id tempus facultas colloquendi non fuerit,
 atque ipse Brundisium sit venturus,
 interesse rei publicae et communis salutis se cum Pompeio colloqui;
 neque vero idem profici longo itineris spatio,
 cum per alios condiciones ferantur,
 ac si coram de omnibus condicionibus disceptetur.

Caesar sends him back to him with orders:
because there was not means or time for speaking at it,
and he himself was abut to come to Brundisium,
to lie between of the republic and to/by common safety for him to speak with
 Pompey; 
and not, indeed, likewise by a long space of journey,
when they brought through other terms,
and if he might dispute in person about all the conditions.
