Book I section [24] 

Pompeius his rebus cognitis, quae erant ad Corfinium gestae,
 Luceria proficiscitur Canusium atque inde Brundisium. 

When Pompey learned of what had been done at Corfinium,
Luceria departs Canusium and from there to Brundisium.
 

Copias undique omnes ex novis dilectibus ad se cogi iubet;
 servos, pastores armat atque eis equos attribuit;
 ex his circiter CCC equites conficit. 

He orders the troops from every side from new levies to collect to him;
he arms slaves, shepherds and allots horses to them;
out of these he accomplishes around 300 cavalry.

L. Manlius praetor Alba cum cohortibus sex profugit,
 Rutilius Lupus praetor Tarracina cum tribus;
 quae procul equitatum Caesaris conspicatae, cui praeerat Vibius Curius,
 relicto praetore signa ad Curium transferunt atque ad eum transeunt. 

Praetor L Manlius Alba escapes with six cohorts, 
Praetor Rutilius Lupus Tarracina with three;
which far off ridden of Caesar's sight, to whom Vibius Curium was in charge,
to/by the remaining praetor they carry battle standard to the meeting house
and cross over to him.

Item reliquis itineribus nonnullae cohortes in agmen Caesaris,
 aliae in equites incidunt. 

Likewise, by the remaining journeys several cohorts into the column of Caesar,
 others happend upon the cavalry.

Reducitur ad eum deprensus ex itinere N. Magius Cremona, praefectus fabrum
Cn. Pompei. 

He leads back to him, seized from the road N. Magius Cremona, put in charge
at the craftsman of Cn. Pompey.

Quem Caesar ad eum remittit cum mandatis:
 quoniam ad id tempus facultas colloquendi non fuerit,
 atque ipse Brundisium sit venturus,
 interesse rei publicae et communis salutis se cum Pompeio colloqui;
 neque vero idem profici longo itineris spatio,
 cum per alios condiciones ferantur,
 ac si coram de omnibus condicionibus disceptetur.

Whom Caesar sends back to him with orders:
 because there was not means or time for speaking at it,
and he himself was abut to come to Brundisium,
to lie between of the republic and to/by common safety for him to speak with
 Pompey; 
and not, indeed, likewise by a long space of journey,
when they brought through other terms,
and if he might dispute in person about all the conditions.
