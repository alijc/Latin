Book I section [24] 

Pompeius his rebus cognitis, quae erant ad Corfinium gestae,
 Luceria proficiscitur Canusium atque inde Brundisium.
 Copias undique omnes ex novis dilectibus ad se cogi iubet;
 servos, pastores armat atque eis equos attribuit; ex his
 circiter CCC equites conficit.  L. Manlius praetor Alba cum
 cohortibus sex profugit, Rutilius Lupus praetor Tarracina
 cum tribus; quae procul equitatum Caesaris conspicatae, cui
 praeerat Vibius Curius, relicto praetore signa ad Curium
 transferunt atque ad eum transeunt.  Item reliquis
 itineribus nonnullae cohortes in agmen Caesaris, aliae in
 equites incidunt.  Reducitur ad eum deprensus ex itinere
 N. Magius Cremona, praefectus fabrum Cn. Pompei.  Quem
 Caesar ad eum remittit cum mandatis: quoniam ad id tempus
 facultas colloquendi non fuerit, atque ipse Brundisium sit
 venturus, interesse rei publicae et communis salutis se cum
 Pompeio colloqui; neque vero idem profici longo itineris
 spatio, cum per alios condiciones ferantur, ac si coram de
 omnibus condicionibus disceptetur.




When Pompey learns of what had happened at Corfinium, he
departs from Luceria to Canusium and from there to
Brundisium.  He orders the troops from the new levies to
assemble to his side; he arms slaves and shepherds and
distributes horses to them; he readies about 300 cavalry out
of these.  Praetor L Manlius escapes Alba with six cohorts,
and Praetor Rutilius Lupus Tarracina with three.  The
cohorts, having sighted Caesar's cavalry, which was
commanded by Vibius Curius, in the distance, having
abandoned the praetor they go over to Curius, carrying the
battle standard.  Likewise, by the various routes, some
cohorts fall in with Caesar's train, and others his cavalry.
N. Magius of Cremona, chief of Cn. Pompey's sappers, is
seized on the road and escorted to him.  Caesar sends him
back to him with a commission: Seeing that there hadn't been
means or time for a conversation, and he himself would be
coming to Brundisium to speak with Pompey on what lay
between the republic and the public weal; and indeed, after
not much time, after bearing others conditions, and if he
might debate about all terms in person.
