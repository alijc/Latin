Book I section [25] 

His datis mandatis Brundisium cum legionibus VI pervenit,
veteranis III et reliquis, quas ex novo dilectu confecerat
atque in itinere compleverat; Domitianas enim cohortes
protinus a Corfinio in Siciliam miserat.  Reperit consules
Dyrrachium profectos cum magna parte exercitus, Pompeium
remanere Brundisii cum cohortibus viginti; neque certum
inveniri poterat, obtinendine Brundisii causa ibi
remansisset, quo facilius omne Hadriaticum mare ex ultimis
Italiae partibus regionibusque Graeciae in potestate
haberet atque ex utraque parte bellum administrare posset,
an inopia navium ibi restitisset, veritusque ne ille
Italiam dimittendam non existimaret, exitus
administrationesque Brundisini portus impedire instituit.
Quorum operum haec erat ratio.  Qua fauces erant
angustissimae portus, moles atque aggerem ab utraque parte
litoris iaciebat, quod his locis erat vadosum mare.
Longius progressus, cum agger altiore aqua contineri non
posset, rates duplices quoquoversus pedum XXX e regione
molis collocabat.  Has quaternis ancoris ex IIII angulis
destinabat, ne fluctibus moverentur.  His perfectis
collocatisque alias deinceps pari magnitudine rates
iungebat.  Has terra atque aggere integebat, ne aditus
atque incursus ad defendendum impediretur.  A fronte atque
ab utroque latere cratibus ac pluteis protegebat; in quarta
quaque earum turres binorum tabulatorum excitabat, quo
commodius ab impetu navium incendiisque defenderet.


After these orders were given he arrives at Brundisium with 6
legions, 3 of them made up of veterans and the rest
assembled from the new levies and supplied on the road; for
he had sent Domitius' cohorts straight from Corfinium to
Sicily.  He discovers that the consuls had left for
Dyrrachium with a large part of the army, that Pompey had
stayed at Brundisium with twenty cohorts; and it could not
be ascertained whether he had remained there for the sake
of occupying Brundisium (as he might easily strongly hold
all of the Adriatic Sea with the end of Italy and regions
of Greece and could manage the war from the other region)
or whether he stood firm there because of his lack of
ships, and fearing that Pompey wasn't planning on quitting
Italy, prepares to prevent the departures and operations of
the port of Brundisium.  His plan consisted of these
fortifications.  Since the approaches to the port were very
narrow, he built jetties and piers on both sides of the
shore, because in these places the sea was shallow.  Having
advanced beyond this, since he could not continue in the
deeper water, he positioned double rafts 30 feet long and
wide reaching beyond the jetties.  He anchored these from
the four corners, to keep them from being moved by the
waves.  Having completed and arranged these things, he
connected the other rafts in order of equal size.  He
covered these with mounds of earth, so that an attack or
assault would be hindered and repelled.  He covered the
front and the other side with brush and breastworks; on
every fourth raft he erected towers two stories tall, from
which it might more easily be defended from attack of the
ships and fires.
