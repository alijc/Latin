Book I section [26] 

Contra haec Pompeius naves magnas onerarias,
 quas in portu Brundisino deprehenderat, adornabat. 

In opposition to these things, Pompey equipped large cargo ships
that he had seized in the port of Brundisinum.


Ibi turres cum ternis tabulatis erigebat easque multis tormentis
 et omni genere telorum completas ad opera Caesaris adpellebat,
 ut rates perrumperet atque opera disturbaret. 

He erected three-story towers there and struck Caesar's fortifications
with many catapults filled with every sort of projectile,
in order to break up the rafts and demolish the fortifications.


Sic cotidie utrimque eminus fundis, sagittis reliquisque telis pugnabatur. 

So daily from both sides from a distance, with slings, arrows and other darts
the battle was fought.


Atque haec Caesar ita administrabat, 
ut condiciones pacis dimittendas non existimaret;
 ac tametsi magnopere admirabatur Magium,
 quem ad Pompeium cum mandatis miserat,
 ad se non remitti,
 atque ea res saepe temptata etsi impetus eius consiliaque tardabat,
 tamen omnibus rebus in eo perseverandum putabat. 

And Caesar commanded these things so,
in order to value the conditions/options for peace about to be abandoned;
and even if he greatly admired Magius,
whom he had sent to Pompey with a commission,
and whom had not been sent back,
and the thing often tested even if he checked his attack and plans,
nevertheless he thought with all things in this to be continued.


Itaque Caninium Rebilum legatum,
 familiarem necessariumque Scriboni Libonis,
 mittit ad eum colloquii causa;
 mandat, ut Libonem de concilianda pace hortetur;
 imprimis, ut ipse cum Pompeio colloqueretur, postulat;
 magnopere sese confidere demonstrat, si eius rei sit potestas facta, fore,
 ut aequis condicionibus ab armis discedatur. 

And so he sends legate Caninius Rebilus, 
and the intimate and connection of Scribonius Libo,
to him in order to converse;
he commands Libo to urge the acquisition of peace;
firstly, he demands that Pompey speak with him in person;
he points out that he himself greatly trusts, if it were within his power,
to withdraw from arms with equal conditions.


Cuius rei magnam partem laudis atque existimationis ad Libonem perventuram,
 si illo auctore atque agente ab armis sit discessum. 

To whose matters ... a great part of praise with opinions arriving to Libo,
if by that authority and advocate he had lain down his arms.


Libo a colloquio Canini digressus ad Pompeium proficiscitur. 

Libo set out from meeting with departed Caninius to Pompey.


Paulo post renuntiat, quod consules absint,
 sine illis non posse agi de compositione. 

A little after he returns, because the consuls are not present,
without whom an agreement cannot be reached.


Ita saepius rem frustra temptatam Caesar aliquando dimittendam sibi iudicat et
de bello agendum.

So more often Caesar judges the matter tried in vain about to be abandoned to
himself and prepares to wage war.
