Contra haec Pompeius naves magnas onerarias, quas in portu
Brundisino deprehenderat, adornabat.  Ibi turres cum ternis
tabulatis erigebat easque multis tormentis et omni genere
telorum completas ad opera Caesaris adpellebat, ut rates
perrumperet atque opera disturbaret.  Sic cotidie utrimque
eminus fundis, sagittis reliquisque telis pugnabatur.  Atque
haec Caesar ita administrabat, ut condiciones pacis dimittendas
non existimaret; ac tametsi magnopere admirabatur Magium, quem
ad Pompeium cum mandatis miserat, ad se non remitti, atque ea
res saepe temptata etsi impetus eius consiliaque tardabat, tamen
omnibus rebus in eo perseverandum putabat.  Itaque Caninium
Rebilum legatum, familiarem necessariumque Scriboni Libonis,
mittit ad eum colloquii causa; mandat, ut Libonem de concilianda
pace hortetur; imprimis, ut ipse cum Pompeio colloqueretur,
postulat; magnopere sese confidere demonstrat, si eius rei sit
potestas facta, fore, ut aequis condicionibus ab armis
discedatur.  Cuius rei magnam partem laudis atque existimationis
ad Libonem perventuram, si illo auctore atque agente ab armis
sit discessum.  Libo a colloquio Canini digressus ad Pompeium
proficiscitur.  Paulo post renuntiat, quod consules absint, sine
illis non posse agi de compositione.  Ita saepius rem frustra
temptatam Caesar aliquando dimittendam sibi iudicat et de bello
agendum.



Faced with this, Pompey equipped large cargo ships that he had
seized in the port of Brundisinum.  He erected three-story
towers on them and struck Caesar's fortifications with many
catapults loaded with every sort of projectile, to break up the
rafts and demolish the fortifications.  So a battle was waged
daily, at a distance, with slings, arrows and other darts from
both sides.  Caesar arranged matters without considering
abandoning options for peace; and even if he wondered why
Magius, whom he had sent to Pompey with a commission, had not
been sent back, and the thing often tested even if he checked
his attack and plans, nevertheless he thought with all things in
this to be continued.  And so he sends the legate Caninius
Rebilus, an intimate and relative of Scribonius Libo, to Pompey
to parlay; he commands him to urge Libo to make peace; first of
all, he asks him to speak with Pompey; he points out that he
himself has every confidence, if at all possible, that they'd
lay down their arms, given equitable terms.  To which matters, a
great renown of opinion would be settled on Libo, if by his
authority and advocacy they would lay down their arms.  After
Caninius departed from the meeting, Libo preceeds to Pompey.  A
little later he returns, because the consuls, without whom an
agreement cannot be reached, are absent.  So Caesar frequently
judges the matter to be tried in vain and should be henceforth
abandoned, and readies himself to wage war.
