Book I section [27] 

Prope dimidia parte operis a Caesare effecta
diebusque in ea re consumptis VIIII naves a consulibus Dyrrachio
remissae, quae priorem partem exercitus eo deportaverant,
Brundisium revertuntur.  Pompeius sive operibus Caesaris
permotus sive etiam quod ab initio Italia excedere constituerat,
adventu navium profectionem parare incipit et, quo facilius
impetum Caesaris tardaret, ne sub ipsa profectione milites
oppidum irrumperent, portas obstruit, vicos plateasque
inaedificat, fossas transversas viis praeducit atque ibi sudes
stipitesque praeacutos defigit.  Haec levibus cratibus terraque
inaequat; aditus autem atque itinera duo, quae extra murum ad
portum ferebant, maximis defixis trabibus atque eis praeacutis
praesepit.  His paratis rebus milites silentio naves conscendere
iubet, expeditos autem ex evocatis, sagittariis funditoribusque
raros in muro turribusque disponit.  Hos certo signo revocare
constituit, cum omnes milites naves conscendissent, atque eis
expedito loco actuaria navigia relinquit.


When Caesar had finished about half of the work, which took 9
days, the ships that had carried the first part of the army were
sent back from Dyrrachium by the consuls, returning to
Brundisium.  Upon the ships' arrival, Pompey, either agitated by
Caesar's fortifications or because he had decided to withdraw
from Italy from the beginning, begins to prepare for departure
and to more easily check Caesar's assault and to keep his
soldiers from breaking into the town when they decamped, he
barricades the gates, walls up the streets and avenues,
constructs trenches across the roads and fixes sharpened stakes
in them.  He surfaces these with smooth wicker-works and dirt;
but he encloses the approach and the two passages (which run
beyond the walls to the port), with very large sharpened logs
that are driven into the earth.  When these things were
prepared, he orders the soldiers to embark in silence, but he
posts a few of the veterans, with bow and slings, but no armor,
on the wall and in the towers.  He sets these to recall at a
certain signal after all of the soldiers had boarded their
ships, and leaves swift ships behind for them in a clear spot.
