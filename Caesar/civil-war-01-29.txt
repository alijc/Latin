Book I section [29] 

Caesar etsi ad spem conficiendi negotii maxime probabat
 coactis navibus mare transire et Pompeium sequi,
 priusquam ille sese transmarinis auxiliis confirmaret,
 tamen eius rei moram temporisque longinquitatem timebat,
 quod omnibus coactis navibus Pompeius praesentem facultatem insequendi
 sui ademerat.

Even though Caesar was especially keen on getting on with the business
of crossing over the sea on a fleet and pursuing Pompey,
he needed to first confirm that he would have support on the other side of the sea,
nevertheless he feared delay and length of time in the matter,
because by the whole fleet Pompey had removed the means at hand to
overtake him.


Relinquebatur, ut ex longinquioribus regionibus Galliae Picenique et a freto
 naves essent exspectandae.

He remained where he was, expecting ships from more remote regions of Gaul and
Picenum and from the straits.


Id propter anni tempus longum atque impeditum videbatur. 

It seemed tedious and difficult on account of the time of year.


Interea veterem exercitum, duas Hispanias confirmari, 
quarum erat altera maximis beneficiis Pompei devincta, 
auxilia, equitatum parari, 
Galliam Italiamque temptari se absente nolebat.

In the meantime ... the experienced/standing army, to be confirmed two Spains,
of which one was obligated by great service to Pompey,
in aid, furnished cavalry,
he was unwilling to be tested Gaul in his absence.
