Book I section [29] 

Caesar etsi ad spem conficiendi negotii maxime probabat
 coactis navibus mare transire et Pompeium sequi,
 priusquam ille sese transmarinis auxiliis confirmaret,
 tamen eius rei moram temporisque longinquitatem timebat,
 quod omnibus coactis navibus Pompeius praesentem facultatem insequendi
 sui ademerat.

Even though Caesar was particularly keen on getting on
with the business of crossing over the sea on a fleet
and pursuing Pompey, he needed to first confirm that he
would have support on the other side of the sea, and yet
he feared delay and length of time in the matter,
because by removing the entire fleet Pompey had deprived
him of the means at hand for overtaking him.


Relinquebatur, ut ex longinquioribus regionibus Galliae Picenique et a freto
 naves essent exspectandae.

He remained where he was, expecting ships from the more
remote regions of Gaul and Picenum and from the straits.


Id propter anni tempus longum atque impeditum videbatur. 

It seemed tedious and difficult on account of the time of year.


Interea veterem exercitum, duas Hispanias confirmari, 
quarum erat altera maximis beneficiis Pompei devincta, 
auxilia, equitatum parari, 
Galliam Italiamque temptari se absente nolebat.

In the meantime he was unwilling 
for the experienced army, the two Spanish provinces,
of which one was obligated to Pompey by a great many services,
to be strengthened,
or for the auxilies and cavalry to be readied,
or for Gaul and Italy to be tested in his absence.
