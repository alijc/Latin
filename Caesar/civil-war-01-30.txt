Book I section [30] 

Itaque in praesentia Pompei sequendi rationem omittit, 
 in Hispaniam proficisci constituit: 
 duumviris municipiorum omnium imperat,
 ut naves conquirant Brundisiumque deducendas curent. 

And so he lays aside his plan of pursuing Pompey for the present
and decides to set out for Spain.
He orders pairs of magistrates for every town,
to seek out ships and arrange for bringing them to Brundisium.


Mittit in Sardiniam cum legione una Valerium legatum,
 in Siciliam Curionem pro praetore cum legionibus duabus;
 eundem, cum Siciliam recepisset,
 protinus in Africam traducere exercitum iubet. 

He sends Valerius as legate to Sardinia with one legion,
and Curio to be praetor of Sicily with two legions;
also, after he had recovered Sicily,
he immediately orders the army to be brought across into Africa.


Sardiniam obtinebat M. Cotta, Siciliam M. Cato;
 Africam sorte Tubero obtinere debebat. 

M. Cotta held Sardinia, and M. Cato Sicily;
 Tubero was chosen by lot to hold Africa.


Caralitani, simul ad se Valerium mitti audierunt,
 nondum profecto ex Italia sua sponte Cottam ex oppido eiciunt. 

The Caralitans, once they heard that Valerium was being sent to them,
accord tossed Cotta, who hadn't yet left, out of town of their own.


Ille perterritus, quod omnem provinciam consentire intellegebat,
 ex Sardinia in Africam profugit. 

He was terrified, because he understood that the entire province was united,
and fled Sardinia for Africa.


Cato in Sicilia naves longas veteres reficiebat,
 novas civitatibus imperabat. 

In Sicily, Cato was repairing ancient galleys,
and ordering new ones from the cities.


Haec magno studio agebat. 

He did these things with great zeal.


In Lucanis Brutiisque per legatos suos civium Romanorum delectus habebat,
 equitum peditumque certum numerum a civitatibus Siciliae exigebat. 

In Lucania and Brutius he held, through his legates, a levy of Roman citizens, 
he expelled a certain number of cavalry and foot from the towns of Sicily.


Quibus rebus paene perfectis adventu Curionis cognito queritur
 in contione sese proiectum ac proditum a Cn. Pompeio,
 qui omnibus rebus imparatissimis non necessarium bellum suscepisset
 et ab se reliquisque in senatu interrogatus omnia sibi esse
 ad bellum apta ac parata confirmavisset. 

These matters were close to completion when he learned of the arrival of Curio.
He complained in an audience that he himself was thrown down and advanced by
Cn. Pompey,
who, although unprepared, had undertaken an unnecessary war
and had been questioned by himself and others in the senate
he had declared that to him everything for the war was suitable and prepared. 


Haec in contione questus ex provincia fugit.

After protesting these things in the assembly,
he fled the province.
