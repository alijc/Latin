Book I section [30] 

Itaque in praesentia Pompei sequendi rationem omittit,
in Hispaniam proficisci constituit: duumviris
municipiorum omnium imperat, ut naves conquirant
Brundisiumque deducendas curent.  Mittit in Sardiniam
cum legione una Valerium legatum, in Siciliam Curionem
pro praetore cum legionibus duabus; eundem, cum
Siciliam recepisset, protinus in Africam traducere
exercitum iubet.  Sardiniam obtinebat M. Cotta,
Siciliam M. Cato; Africam sorte Tubero obtinere
debebat.  Caralitani, simul ad se Valerium mitti
audierunt, nondum profecto ex Italia sua sponte Cottam
ex oppido eiciunt.  Ille perterritus, quod omnem
provinciam consentire intellegebat, ex Sardinia in
Africam profugit.  Cato in Sicilia naves longas veteres
reficiebat, novas civitatibus imperabat.  Haec magno
studio agebat.  In Lucanis Brutiisque per legatos suos
civium Romanorum delectus habebat, equitum peditumque
certum numerum a civitatibus Siciliae exigebat.  Quibus
rebus paene perfectis adventu Curionis cognito queritur
in contione sese proiectum ac proditum a Cn. Pompeio,
qui omnibus rebus imparatissimis non necessarium bellum
suscepisset et ab se reliquisque in senatu interrogatus
omnia sibi esse ad bellum apta ac parata
confirmavisset.  Haec in contione questus ex provincia
fugit.




And so he lays aside his plan of pursuing Pompey for
the present and decides to set out for Spain.  He
orders the magistrates of every town to seek out ships
and arrange for bringing them to Brundisium.  He sends
Valerius as legate to Sardinia with one legion, and
Curio as praetor to Sicily with two legions; and
orders him, after he has recovered Sicily, to
immediately carry the army across into Africa.
M. Cotta held Sardinia, and M. Cato Sicily; and Tubero
was chosen by lot to hold Africa.  The Caralians, once
they heard that Valerius was being sent to them,
tossed Cotta out of town of their own accord, before
Valerius even left Italy.  Cotta was terrified,
because he understood that the entire province was
united against him, and fled Sardinia for Africa.  In
Sicily, Cato was repairing ancient galleys, and
ordering new ones from the cities.  He performed these
tasks with great zeal.  In Lucania and Brutius he
held, through his legates, a levy of Roman citizens,
and took a certain number of cavalry and foot from the
towns of Sicily.  These matters were close to
completion when he learned of the arrival of Curio.
He complained in a meeting that he himself had been
cast out and betrayed by Cn. Pompey, who, although
unprepared, had undertaken an unnecessary war and had
been questioned by himself and others in the senate he
had declared that to him everything for the war was
suitable and prepared.  After protesting these things
in the meeting, he fled the province.
