Book I section  [31] 

Nacti vacuas ab imperiis Sardiniam Valerius, Curio Siciliam,
 cum exercitibus eo perveniunt. 

Those who had received command reached, along with their armies,
uncommanded territories, Valerius at Sardiniam and Curio at Sicily.

Tubero cum in Africam venisset,
 invenit in provincia cum imperio Attium Varum;
 qui ad Auximum, ut supra demonstravimus,
 amissis cohortibus protinus ex fuga in Africam pervenerat
 atque eam sua sponte vacuam occupaverat
 delectuque habito duas legiones effecerat,
 hominum et locorum notitia et usu eius provinciae nactus aditus ad ea conanda,
 quod paucis ante annis ex praetura eam provinciam obtinuerat.

After Tubero arrived in Africa, 
 he found the province under the command of Attius Varus,
who, as we have shown above, 
 had fled to Africa right after losing his cohorts at Auximum
and finding it uncommanded, had freely captured it
and, raising a levy, had mustered two legions,

of men and of places by acquaintance and by experience of his province 
having recieved access/opportunity to be about to test the things,

because a few years earlier he had obtained the province after his praetorship.

 Hic venientem Uticam navibus Tuberonem portu atque oppido prohibet
 neque adfectum valetudine filium exponere in terra patitur,
 sed sublatis ancoris excedere eo loco cogit.

This man keeps Tubero, coming to Utica by ship, from the harbor and town
and, not being endowed with good health, allows his son to land,
but having weighed anchor he gathers to withdraw from that place.
