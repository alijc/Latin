Book I section  [31] 

Nacti vacuas ab imperiis Sardiniam Valerius, Curio Siciliam,
 cum exercitibus eo perveniunt. 

Those who had met? reached, along with their armies, lands empty of command,
Valerius to Sardiniam and Curio to Sicily.

Tubero cum in Africam venisset,
 invenit in provincia cum imperio Attium Varum;
 qui ad Auximum, ut supra demonstravimus,
 amissis cohortibus protinus ex fuga in Africam pervenerat
 atque eam sua sponte vacuam occupaverat
 delectuque habito duas legiones effecerat,
 hominum et locorum notitia et usu eius provinciae nactus aditus ad ea conanda,
 quod paucis ante annis ex praetura eam provinciam obtinuerat.

When Tubero had arrived in Africa, 
 he found Attius Varus with authority in the province;
who to Auximum, as we have shown above,
having lost his cohorts had at once fled to Africa
and had captured it, empty, of his own accord
and, having held a levy, mustered two legions,
 of men and of places by acquaintance and by experience of his province 
having recieved access/opportunity to be about to test the things,
because a few years before from the praetorship he had obtained the province.

 Hic venientem Uticam navibus Tuberonem portu atque oppido prohibet
 neque adfectum valetudine filium exponere in terra patitur,
 sed sublatis ancoris excedere eo loco cogit.

This man bars Tubero, coming to Utica by ship, from the harbor and town
and his son, not endowed with good health, allows to set out into the region,
but having weighed anchor he gathers to withdraw from that place.
