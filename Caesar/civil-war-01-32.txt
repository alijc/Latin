Book I section [32] 

His rebus confectis Caesar, 
ut reliquum tempus a labore intermitteretur, 
milites in proxima municipia deducit; 
ipse ad urbem proficiscitur. 

After completing these actions, Caesar
turns his troops aside into the neighboring towns to take some rest.
He himself proceeds to the city.


Coacto senatu iniurias inimicorum commemorat. 

After convening the senate he places his injuries from his enemies on record.


Docet se nullum extraordinarium honorem appetisse, 
sed exspectato legitimo tempore consulatus eo fuisse contentum, 
quod omnibus civibus pateret. 

He points out the he had sought no special honor
but waited for the proper time to seek the consulship,
because he had been open to all citizens.


Latum ab X tribunis plebis contradicentibus inimicis, 
Catone vero acerrime repugnante et pristina consuetudine dicendi mora dies
extrahente, 
ut sui ratio absentis haberetur, ipso consule Pompeio ; 
qui si improbasset, cur ferri passus esset? 

Supported by 10 tribunes of the people, speaking in opposition to his enemies,
with Cato indeed opposing most fiercely and by old habit filibustering for days,
so that the reason for his absence was held, under consul Pompey himself;
who, if he had disapproved, why had he allowed it to be carried out?


Si probasset, cur se uti populi beneficio prohibuisset? 

If he had approved, why had he forbidden the people the right of use?


Patientiam proponit suam, cum de exercitibus dimittendis ultro postulavisset; 
in quo iacturam dignitatis atque honoris ipse facturus esset. 

He relates his patience, when he had requested that the armies be
disbanded;
in which he himself would receive a loss of dignity and honor.


Acerbitatem inimicorum docet, 
qui, quod ab altero postularent, in se recusarent, 
atque omnia permisceri mallent, quam imperium exercitusque dimittere. 

He points out the bitterness of his enemies,
who, because they were demanding by another, were objecting to himself,
and preferred to embroil everything, than to dismiss the command and army.


Iniuriam in eripiendis legionibus praedicat, 
crudelitatem et insolentiam in circumscribendis tribunis plebis; 
condiciones a se latas, expetita colloquia et denegata commemorat. 

He proclaims his injury in the legions that had been snatched away,
the cruelty and insolence in confining the tribunes of the people;
relates the conditions by himself brought, the talks that were requested and denied.


Pro quibus rebus hortatur ac postulat, 
ut rem publicam suscipiant atque una secum administrent. 

On account of these things he urges and demands,
so that they might support the republic and manage only/some with him.


Sin timore defugiant, 
illis se oneri non futurum et per se rem publicam administraturum. 

But if they were to escape dread,
to/by those self to the burden not going to be and 
through self at the republic going to direct.


Legatos ad Pompeium de compositione mitti oportere, neque se reformidare, 
quod in senatu Pompeius paulo ante dixisset, ad quos legati mitterentur, 
his auctoritatem attribui timoremque eorum, qui mitterent significari. 

Legates to Pompey from the arrangement to be sent to require,
and not self to dread,
because/that in the senate Pompey had spoken a little earlier,
to whom the legates had been sent,
to/by these authority to be assigned and their fear,
who might send to be shown.


Tenuis atque infirmi haec animi videri. 

Of feeble and frail these things soul to be seen.


Se vero, ut operibus anteire studuerit,
sic iustitia et aequitate velle superare.

Self, in truth, so that to/by the works he would desire to go ahead,
so justice and fairness to wish to overcome.
