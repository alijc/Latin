Book I section [33] 

Probat rem senatus de mittendis legatis:
 sed, qui mitterentur, non reperiebantur,
 maximeque timoris causa pro se quisque id munus legationis recusabat. 

The senate approves the motion about sending legates:
but they didn't figure out who would be sent,
and especially due to the fear for himself each one refused this embassy.


Pompeius enim discedens ab urbe in senatu dixerat eodem se habiturum loco,
 qui Romae remansissent et qui in castris Caesaris fuissent. 

For Pompey, marching off from the city, had said in the senate 
by that very spot he was going to have,
those who had remained behind and who had been in the field.


Sic triduum disputationibus excusationibusque extrahitur. 

Thus was it dragged out for three days by disputes and excuses.


Subicitur etiam L. Metellus, tribunus plebis, ab inimicis Caesaris,
 qui hanc rem distrahat, reliquasque res,
 quascumque agere instituerit, impediat. 

Even L. Metellus, the tribune of the people, was exposed by Caesar's enemies ,
who would wrench the matter apart, and the remaining business,
and would hinder whatever matters they had decided to take up.


Cuius cognito consilio Caesar frustra diebus aliquot consumptis,
 ne reliquum tempus amittat, infectis eis, quae agere destinaverat,
 ab urbe proficiscitur atque in ulteriorem Galliam pervenit.

Of whom having learned of the plan Caesar in vain several days were eaten up,
lest he lose the remaining time, without accomplished what had been intended,
departed from the city and reached outer Gaul.
