Book I section [33] 

Probat rem senatus de mittendis legatis:
 sed, qui mitterentur, non reperiebantur,
 maximeque timoris causa pro se quisque id munus legationis recusabat. 

The senate approves the motion about sending legates:
but they didn't figure out who would be sent,
and each one turned this embassy down
out of a particular fear for his own safety.


Pompeius enim discedens ab urbe in senatu dixerat eodem se habiturum loco,
 qui Romae remansissent et qui in castris Caesaris fuissent. 

For Pompey, marching off from the city, had said in the senate 
by that very spot he was going to have,
those of Rome who had remained behind and those who had been in Caesar's camps.


Sic triduum disputationibus excusationibusque extrahitur. 

Thus was it dragged out for three days with disputes and excuses.


Subicitur etiam L. Metellus, tribunus plebis, ab inimicis Caesaris,
 qui hanc rem distrahat, reliquasque res,
 quascumque agere instituerit, impediat. 

Even L. Metellus, the tribune of the people, was brought low by Caesar's enemies,
who would tear apart first one bit, then the rest,
and would hinder whatever matters they had decided to take up.


Cuius cognito consilio Caesar frustra diebus aliquot consumptis,
 ne reliquum tempus amittat, infectis eis, quae agere destinaverat,
 ab urbe proficiscitur atque in ulteriorem Galliam pervenit.

By the time Caesar had understood their plan several days had been uselessly
eaten up.
To keep from losing the time left to him, 
he left what he'd intended undone,
and left the city and for outer Gaul.
