Book I section [33] 

Probat rem senatus de mittendis legatis: sed, qui mitterentur, non
reperiebantur, maximeque timoris causa pro se quisque id munus legationis
recusabat.  Pompeius enim discedens ab urbe in senatu dixerat eodem se
habiturum loco, qui Romae remansissent et qui in castris Caesaris
fuissent.  Sic triduum disputationibus excusationibusque extrahitur.
Subicitur etiam L. Metellus, tribunus plebis, ab inimicis Caesaris, qui
hanc rem distrahat, reliquasque res, quascumque agere instituerit,
impediat.  Cuius cognito consilio Caesar frustra diebus aliquot
consumptis, ne reliquum tempus amittat, infectis eis, quae agere
destinaverat, ab urbe proficiscitur atque in ulteriorem Galliam pervenit.



The senate approves the motion about sending legates: but they didn't
figure out who would be sent, for each one turned this embassy down out
of a particular fear for his own safety.  For Pompey, on leaving the
city, had said in the senate that he would lump together those who had
remained in Rome with those who had been in Caesar's camps.  It was
dragged out in this way for three days with disputes and excuses.  Even
L. Metellus, the tribune of the people, was suborned by Caesar's enemies.
He would tear apart first one bit, then the rest, and would hinder
whatever matters he had decided to take up.  By the time Caesar had
understood his plan several days had been uselessly eaten up.  To keep
from losing the time left to him, he left what he'd intended undone, and
left the city for outer Gaul.
