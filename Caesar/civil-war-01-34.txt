Book I section [34] 

Quam ob rem placuit ei ut ad Ariovistum legatos mitteret,
 qui ab eo postularent uti aliquem locum medium utrisque conloquio deligeret:
 velle sese de re publica et summis utriusque rebus cum eo agere.

On account of this matter it pleased him to send envoys to Ariovistus,
to ask him to pick some middle ground from them both to parlay:
that he himself wished to deal with matters about the republic 
that were of the highest concern to the both of them.


Ei legationi Ariovistus respondit:
 si quid ipsi a Caesare opus esset, sese ad eum venturum fuisse;
 si quid ille se velit, illum ad se venire oportere. 

Ariovistus responded to this embassy:
if anything to himself by Caesar would be need,
he himself would be about to come to him:
if anything that he wished, it would be needful for him to come to him.


Praeterea se neque sine exercitu in eas partes Galliae venire audere
 quas Caesar possideret,
 neque exercitum sine magno commeatu atque
 molimento in unum locum contrahere posse. 

Besides, he himself did not dare to enter, without an army, the parts of Gaul 
that Caesar held,
nor could an army assemble in one place without a great deal of travel and
exertion. 


Sibi autem mirum videri quid in sua Gallia,
 quam bello vicisset,
 aut Caesari aut omnino populo Romano negotii esset.

But to himself a wonderful thing to seem what in his Gaul,
that he had won by war,
either to Caeser or to the entire population or Roman it would be of trouble.
