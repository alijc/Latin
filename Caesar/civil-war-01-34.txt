Book I section [34] 

Quo cum venisset, cognoscit missum a Pompeio Vibullium Rufum, quem
paucis ante diebus Corfinio captum ipse dimiserat; profectum item
Domitium ad occupandam Massiliam navibus actuariis septem, quas
Igilii et in Cosano a privatis coactas servis, libertis, colonis
suis compleverat; praemissos etiam legatos Massilienses domum,
nobiles adulescentes, quos ab urbe discedens Pompeius erat
adhortatus, ne nova Caesaris officia veterum suorum beneficiorum in
eos memoriam expellerent.  Quibus mandatis acceptis Massilienses
portas Caesari clauserant; Albicos, barbaros homines, qui in eorum
fide antiquitus erant montesque supra Massiliam incolebant, ad se
vocaverant; frumentum ex finitimis regionibus atque ex omnibus
castellis in urbem convexerant; armorum officinas in urbe
instituerant; muros portas classem reficiebant.



After he got there, he learned that Pompey had sent Vibullius
Rufus, who had been captured at Corfinium and whom he himself had
released a few days earlier, into Spain.  Also, Domitius had
departed to attack Massilia with seven swift ships, which he had
furnished at Igilium and in Cosanum and manned with his personal
slaves, freedmen and tenant-farmers.  Envoys had even been sent
ahead to the Massilians, well born youths, whom Pompey had urged,
when he left Rome, to not let the new services of Caesar drive out
the memory of the kindnesses of his veterans.  When they received
these orders the Massilians closed their gates to Caesar; they
called to them the Albicans, barbarians, who were in their trust of
old and inhabited the mountains above Massilia, they gathered the
crops from the neighboring regions and from all of the fortresses
in the city; they prepared of the arms workshops in the city; they
repaired the wall, the gates and the fleet.
