Book I section [36]  

Haec dum inter eos aguntur,
 Domitius navibus Massiliam pervenit atque ab eis receptus urbi praeficitur;
 summa ei belli administrandi permittitur. 

While these were passing between them, 
Domitius arrived at Massilia by ship and was accepted by them and placed in
command of the city;
the highest to him of the war about to be managing he was let through.


Eius imperio classem quoquo versus dimittunt;
 onerarias naves, quas ubique possunt,
 deprehendunt atque in portum deducunt,
 parum clavis aut materia atque armamentis instructis ad reliquas armandas
 reficiendasque utuntur;
 frumenti quod inventum est, in publicum conferunt;
 reliquas merces commeatusque ad obsidionem urbis,
 si accidat, reservant. 

By his command, they disband the levy everywhere;
they impound all the cargo ships that they can,
and escort them into port,
of equal by nails or wood and rigging equipped to the rest of the fitted-out
and repaired they make use of;
the supplies that were found, they assembled in public;
the rest of the merchandise and provisions to the seige of the city,
if it were to happen, they reserve.


Quibus iniuriis permotus Caesar legiones tres Massiliam adducit;
 turres vineasque ad oppugnationem urbis agere,
 naves longas Arelate numero XII facere instituit.

By these injustices Caesar, aroused, leads up three legions to Massilia;
he prepares to build towers and vines to conduct an assault of the city
and galleys Arelate? to the number of 12.


Quibus effectis armatisque diebus XXX,
 a qua die materia caesa est,
 adductisque Massiliam his D. Brutum praeficit,
 C. Trebonium legatum ad oppugnationem Massiliae relinquit.

By which, having been accomplished within 30 days, 
from which day the wood was cut down,
and these things having been contracted he puts D. Brutus in charge of Massilia,
leaves C. Trebonius as his commander of the assault of Massilia.
