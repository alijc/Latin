Book I section [36]  

Haec dum inter eos aguntur, Domitius navibus Massiliam pervenit
atque ab eis receptus urbi praeficitur; summa ei belli
administrandi permittitur.  Eius imperio classem quoquo versus
dimittunt; onerarias naves, quas ubique possunt, deprehendunt
atque in portum deducunt, parum clavis aut materia atque
armamentis instructis ad reliquas armandas reficiendasque
utuntur; frumenti quod inventum est, in publicum conferunt;
reliquas merces commeatusque ad obsidionem urbis, si accidat,
reservant.  Quibus iniuriis permotus Caesar legiones tres
Massiliam adducit; turres vineasque ad oppugnationem urbis
agere, naves longas Arelate numero XII facere instituit.  Quibus
effectis armatisque diebus XXX, a qua die materia caesa est,
adductisque Massiliam his D. Brutum praeficit, C. Trebonium
legatum ad oppugnationem Massiliae relinquit.



While these messages are passing between them Domitius arrives
at Massilia with his ships and is received by them and
placed in command of the city; he is given the utmost powers of
managing the war.  At his command, they send the fleet out in
all directions; they impound all the cargo ships that they can
and escort them into port, they use the nails, timbers and
rigging of the inadequate ones to outfit and repair the rest;
they gather what supplies they could find into the public
coffers; they reserve the rest of the merchandise and provisions
against a seige of the city, if it should happen.  Caesar,
aroused by these injustices, leads three legions up to Massilia;
he prepares towers and shelters to conduct an assault of the
city and orders galleys to built at Arelate, to the number of 12.
After accomplishing these things in 30 days from the day that
the wood was cut, and leading them to fruition, he puts
D. Brutus in command of Massilia, leaving C. Trebonius as
commander of the assault of Massilia.
