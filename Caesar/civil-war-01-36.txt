Book I section [36]  

Haec dum inter eos aguntur,
 Domitius navibus Massiliam pervenit atque ab eis receptus urbi praeficitur;
 summa ei belli administrandi permittitur. 

While these were passing between them, 
Domitius arrived at Massilia by ship and was received by them and placed in
command of the city;
he is permitted the utmost matters of managing the war.


Eius imperio classem quoquo versus dimittunt;
 onerarias naves, quas ubique possunt,
 deprehendunt atque in portum deducunt,
 parum clavis aut materia atque armamentis instructis ad reliquas armandas
 reficiendasque utuntur;
 frumenti quod inventum est, in publicum conferunt;
 reliquas merces commeatusque ad obsidionem urbis,
 si accidat, reservant. 

By his command, they disband the levy everywhere;
they impound all the cargo ships that they can and escort them into port,
they make use of insufficient nails or wood and prepared rigging to outfit and
repair the rest of the ships;
they gather what supplies they could find in common;
they reserve the rest of the merchandise and provisions against a seige of the
city, in case it happens.


Quibus iniuriis permotus Caesar legiones tres Massiliam adducit;
 turres vineasque ad oppugnationem urbis agere,
 naves longas Arelate numero XII facere instituit.

Caesar, aroused by these injustices, leads three legions up to Massilia;
he prepares towers and shelters to conduct an assault of the city
and to build galleys at Arelate? to the number of 12.


Quibus effectis armatisque diebus XXX,
 a qua die materia caesa est,
 adductisque Massiliam his D. Brutum praeficit,
 C. Trebonium legatum ad oppugnationem Massiliae relinquit.

After accomplishing these things in 30 days from the day that the wood was cut,
and leading them to fruition,
 he puts D. Brutus in command of Massilia,
leaving C. Trebonius as commander of the assault of Massilia.
