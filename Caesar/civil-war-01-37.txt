Book I section [37]  

Dum haec parat atque administrat, C. Fabium legatum cum
legionibus III, quas Narbone circumque ea loca hiemandi
causa disposuerat, in Hispaniam praemittit celeriterque
saltus Pyrenaeos occupari iubet, qui eo tempore ab
L. Afranio legato praesidiis tenebantur.  Reliquas
legiones, quae longius hiemabant, subsequi iubet.  Fabius,
ut erat imperatum, adhibita celeritate praesidium ex saltu
deiecit magnisque itineribus ad exercitum Afrani contendit.

While he is preparing and managing these matters, he sends
C. Fabius ahead to Spain, with three legions that he had
had wintered at Narbone and there about, and orders him to
swiftly seize the Pyrenean passes, which at that time were
held by detachments commanded by L. Afranius.  He orders
the remaining legions, whose winter quarters were further
away, to follow them.  Fabius, as he had been commanded,
with all due speed dislodged the garrison from the pass and
by means of a forced march hastened to the army of
Afranius.
