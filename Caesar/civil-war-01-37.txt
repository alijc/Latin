Book I section [37]  

Dum haec parat atque administrat,
 C. Fabium legatum cum legionibus III,
 quas Narbone circumque ea loca hiemandi causa disposuerat,
 in Hispaniam praemittit celeriterque saltus Pyrenaeos occupari iubet,
 qui eo tempore ab L. Afranio legato praesidiis tenebantur. 

While he is preparing and managing these matters,
he sends C. Fabius ahead to Spain
along with three legions
that he had posted at Narbonum for the winter
and orders them to swiftly seize the Pyrenees passes,
which at that time were held by the garrisons commanded by L. Afranius.


Reliquas legiones, quae longius hiemabant, subsequi iubet. 

He orders the remaining legions, that were still wintering over, to follow them.


Fabius, ut erat imperatum,
 adhibita celeritate praesidium ex saltu deiecit
 magnisque itineribus ad exercitum Afrani contendit.

Fabius, as he had been commanded,
having employed speed, overthrew the garrison from the pass
and by means of a forced march hastened to the army of Afranius.
