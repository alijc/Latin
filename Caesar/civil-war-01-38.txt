Adventu L.Vibulli Rufi,
 quem a Pompeio missum in Hispaniam demonstratum est,
 Afranius et Petreius et Varro, legati Pompei,
 quorum unus Hispaniam citeriorem tribus legionibus,
 alter ulteriorem a saltu Castulonensi ad Anam duabus legionibus,
 tertius ab Ana Vettonum agrum Lusitaniamque pari numero legionum optinebat,
 officia inter se partiuntur,
 uti Petreius ex Lusitania per Vettones cum omnibus copiis ad Afranium
 proficiscatur,
 Varro cum eis, quas habebat,
 legionibus omnem ulteriorem Hispaniam tueatur.

Afranius and Petreius and Varro, envoys of Pompey,
of whom one held the near side of Spain with three legions,
the next the far side from the Castulonenian pass to Ana with two legions,
and the third from Ana the Vettonum field and Lusitania with an equal number of
legions,

he could protect all of further Spain with legions.


His rebus constitutis equites auxiliaque
 toti Lusitaniae a Petreio, Celtiberiae, Cantabris barbarisque omnibus,
 qui ad Oceanum pertinent, ab Afranio imperantur. 

After these matters had been resolved the knights and auxiliaries
of all of Lusitania from Petreium, Celtiberia and all of barbarian Cantabrum,
which extend to the ocean, were commanded by Afranius.


Quibus coactis celeriter Petreius per Vettones ad Afranium pervenit,
 constituuntque communi consilio bellum ad Ilerdam propter ipsius opportunitatem
 gerere.

And when they'd been collected Pervenit came to Afranius through Vettones,
and by a common plan resolved to wage war to Ilerda at their earlies
convenience.
