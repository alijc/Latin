Adventu L.Vibulli Rufi, quem a Pompeio missum in
Hispaniam demonstratum est, Afranius et Petreius et
Varro, legati Pompei, quorum unus Hispaniam
citeriorem tribus legionibus, alter ulteriorem a
saltu Castulonensi ad Anam duabus legionibus,
tertius ab Ana Vettonum agrum Lusitaniamque pari
numero legionum optinebat, officia inter se
partiuntur, uti Petreius ex Lusitania per Vettones
cum omnibus copiis ad Afranium proficiscatur, Varro
cum eis, quas habebat, legionibus omnem ulteriorem
Hispaniam tueatur.  His rebus constitutis equites
auxiliaque toti Lusitaniae a Petreio, Celtiberiae,
Cantabris barbarisque omnibus, qui ad Oceanum
pertinent, ab Afranio imperantur.  Quibus coactis
celeriter Petreius per Vettones ad Afranium
pervenit, constituuntque communi consilio bellum ad
Ilerdam propter ipsius opportunitatem gerere.


Upon the arrival of L. Vibullius Rufus, whom, as has
been mentioned, Pompey sent into Spain, Afranius and
Petreius and Varro were Pompey's legates.  One held
the near side of Spain with three legions, the next
the far side, from the Castillian forest to the
Anas, with two legions, and the third Lusitania and
the Vettones' territory, from the Anas on, with the
same number of legions.  They divided their duties
between them, so that Petreius should leave
Lusitania with all his forces and march through the
land of the Vettones to Afranius, and Varro should
protect all of outer Spain with the legions that he
commanded.  After these matters had been resolved
Petreius requisitioned knights and auxiliaries from
all of Lusitania, and Afranius those of Celtiberia
and all of barbarian Cantabrum, which extend to the
ocean.  And when they'd been collected Petreius
speedily came to Afranius by way of the Vettones,
and by a common plan they resolved to wage war
before Ilerda because it was a convenient location.
