Erant, ut supra demonstratum est, legiones Afranii tres, Petreii duae,
praeterea scutatae citerioris provinciae et caetratae ulterioris
Hispaniae cohortes circiter LXXX equitumque utriusque provinciae
circiter V milia.  Caesar legiones in Hispaniam praemiserat VI,
auxilia peditum V milia, equitum III milia, quae omnibus superioribus
bellis habuerat, et parem ex Gallia numerum, quam ipse pacaverat,
nominatim ex omnibus civitatibus nobilissimo et fortissimo quoque
evocato, huc optimi generis hominum ex Aquitanis montanisque, qui
Galliam provinciam attingunt addiderat.  Audierat Pompeium per
Mauretaniam cum legionibus iter in Hispaniam facere confestimque esse
venturum.  Simul a tribunis militum centurionibusque mutuas pecunias
sumpsit; has exercitui distribuit.  Quo facto duas res consecutus est,
quod pignore animos centurionum devinxit et largitione militum
voluntates redemit.


There were, as has already been mentioned, three of Afranius' legions
and two of Petreius', besides about 80 cohorts of the nearby province
(with long shields) and of further Spain (with small ones) and
close to 5000 provincial horse.  Caesar had sent 6 legions ahead
into Spain, with 5000 auxiliaries of infantry and 3000 of horse that he had
commanded in previous wars, and an equal number from Gaul (which he
himself had subdued).  He also summoned the noblest and strongest from
all the cities by name, to which he added men of the best families
from Aquitane and from the mountains that touch the province of Gaul;
for he had heard that Pompey had made a journey through Mauretania
into Spain with his legions and that his arrival was imminent.  At the
same time he borrowed money from the soldiers' tribunes and the
centurions and distributed it to the army.  When this was done two
things resulted, that he bound fast the spirit of the centurions with
this pledge and bought the good will of the soldiers by his generosity.
