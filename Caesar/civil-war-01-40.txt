Book I section[40] 

Fabius finitimarum civitatum animos litteris nuntiisque temptabat. 

Fabius tested the courage of the neighoring cities with a letter and messengers.


In Sicori flumine pontes effecerat duos distantes inter se milia passuum IIII. 

He completed two separate bridges on the River Sicoris 4 miles apart.


His pontibus pabulatum mittebat,
 quod ea quae citra flumen fuerant,
 superioribus diebus consumpserat. 

He sent forage over these bridges,
because he had already used up what was on the near side of the river 
in the preceeding days. 


Hoc idem fere atque eadem de causa Pompeiani exercitus duces faciebant,
 crebroque inter se equestribus proeliis contendebant. 

The generals were doing this wildly, same and same, on account of Pompey's army,
and were frequently contending battles between themselves with cavalry.


Huc cum cotidiana consuetudine congressae pabulatoribus praesidio
 propiore ponte legiones Fabianae duae flumen transissent,
 impedimentaque et omnis equitatus sequeretur,
 subito vi ventorum et aquae magnitudine pons est interruptus
 et reliqua multitudo equitum interclusa. 

Having approached this place on a daily basis
 by the foragers under the protection
two of Fabianus' legions crossed the river over the nearer bridge,
and the heavy baggage and all the cavalry followed.
Suddenly the bridge was broken up by a powerful surge of wind and water
and a great number of the remaining horse were cut off.


Quo cognito a Petreio et Afranio ex aggere atque cratibus,
 quae flumine ferebantur, celeriter suo ponte Afranius,
 quem oppido castrisque coniunctum habebat,
 legiones IIII equitatumque omnem traiecit
 duabusque Fabianis occurrit legionibus. 

When Petreius and Afranius learned of this, from the wreckage
carried down on the river, Afranius,
who had excellent communication with the camp,
quickly transferred 4 legions and the whole cavalry to his own bridge
and Fabianis opposed them with two legions.


Cuius adventu nuntiato L. Plancus,
 qui legionibus praeerat,
 necessaria re coactus locum capit superiorem
 diversamque aciem in duas partes constituit,
 ne ab equitatu circumveniri posset. 

Upon the arrival of his messenger, L Plancus, who commanded the legions,
compelled by the unavoidable matter,
siezed the high ground and established separate battle lines in two sections,
to prevent his being encircled by cavalry.


Ita congressus impari numero magnos impetus legionum equitatusque sustinet. 

And so, engaging with an unequal number he sustained powerful assaults of
infantry and horse.


Commisso ab equitibus proelio signa legionum duarum procul ab utrisque
 conspiciuntur, quas C. Fabius ulteriore ponte subsidio nostris miserat
 suspicatus fore id,
 quod accidit,
 ut duces adversariorum occasione et beneficio fortunae ad nostros opprimendos
 uterentur. 

When the cavalry had joined the battle, the standards of two legions were
spied at a distance, which C. Fabius had sent to the further
bridge with the reinforcements of our men. 


Quarum adventu proelium dirimitur, ac suas uterque legiones reducit in castra.

The battle was interrupted by their arrival,
and he led back both of his own legions into the camp.
