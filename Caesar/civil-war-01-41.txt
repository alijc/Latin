Eo biduo Caesar cum equitibus DCCCC, quos sibi praesidio
reliquerat, in castra pervenit.  Pons, qui fuerat tempestate
interruptus, paene erat refectus; hunc noctu perfici iussit.
Ipse cognita locorum natura ponti castrisque praesidio sex
cohortes reliquit atque omnia impedimenta et postero die
omnibus copiis triplici instructa acie ad Ilerdam
proficiscitur et sub castris Afranii constitit et ibi
paulisper sub armis moratus facit aequo loco pugnandi
potestatem.  Potestate facta Afranius copias educit et in
medio colle sub castris constituit.  Caesar, ubi cognovit per
Afranium stare, quo minus proelio dimicaretur, ab infimis
radicibus montis intermissis circiter passibus CCCC castra
facere constituit et, ne in opere faciundo milites repentino
hostium incursu exterrerentur atque opere prohiberentur,
vallo muniri vetuit, quod eminere et procul videri necesse
erat, sed a fronte contra hostem pedum XV fossam fieri
iussit.  Prima et secunda acies in armis, ut ab initio
constituta erat, permanebat; post has opus in occulto a III
acie fiebat.  Sic omne prius est perfectum, quam
intellegeretur ab Afranio castra muniri.  Sub vesperum Caesar
intra hanc fossam legiones reducit atque ibi sub armis
proxima nocte conquiescit.




In two days Caesar arrived at the camp with a detachment of
900 horse that he had kept with him.  The repairs for bridge
that had been broken up in the storm were nearly done; he
ordered it to be completed during the night.  After
acquainting himself with the environs, he leaves six cohorts
to guard the bridge and the camp and all the baggage.  He
sets out for Ilerda on the next day with all his troops,
drawn up in three lines, and comes to a halt before the camp
of Afranius.  After a short wait, under arms, he offers the
opportunity of fighting on even ground.  After this offer was
made, Afranius leads out his troops and draws them up in the
middle of a hill before his camp.  When he learned that
Afranius was standing pat, by which he was risking less than
in a battle, Caesar made camp about 400 paces from the foot
of the mountain and, to keep the soldiers from being
surprised in their labor by an enemy attack, he did not allow
a palisade to be erected because it would unavoidably stand
out and be visible from a distance.  But he did order a 15
foot trench to be dug at the front, facing the enemy.  The
first and second battle lines remained under arms, as they
had been from the beginning; behind them fortifications were
built by the third line, in secret.  And so all the work was
completed, before it was learned by Afranius that the camp
was fortified.  In the evening Caesar leads the legions
within this ditch and there takes his rest under arms in the
coming night.
