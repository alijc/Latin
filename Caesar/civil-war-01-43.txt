Book I section  [43] 

Erat inter oppidum Ilerdam et proximum collem,
 ubi castra Petreius atque Afranius habebant,
 planities circiter passuum CCC,
 atque in hoc fere medio spatio tumulus erat paulo editior; 

There was, between the town of Ilerda and the next hill,
where Petreius and Afranius had their camp,
a flat spot about 300 feet across,
and very nearly in the middle of this space was a small hillock;


quem si occupavisset Caesar et communisset,
 ab oppido et ponte et commeatu omni,
 quem in oppidum contulerant,
 se interclusurum adversarios confidebat. 

which, had Caesar seized it and fortified it,
by/from the town and the bridge and all the supplies,
that they'd gathered in the town,
he had confidence that he could blockade his oppponents.


Hoc sperans legiones III ex castris educit
 acieque in locis idoneis instructa unius legionis antesignanos procurrere
 atque eum tumulum occupare iubet. 

Hoping this he led three legions out of the camp
and having drawn up a battle line in the suitable places 
he ordered the front rank of one legion to run ahead
and capture the hillock.


Qua re cognita celeriter
 quae in statione pro castris erant Afranii cohortes
 breviore itinere ad eundem occupandum locum mittuntur. 

Which thing having been quickly learned about
of which in the outposts before the camp were the cohorts of Afranius
by a shorter march to capture the same place were sent.


Contenditur proelio, et quod prius in tumulum Afraniani venerant,
 nostri repelluntur
 atque aliis submissis subsidiis terga vertere
 seque ad signa legionum recipere coguntur.

This is disputed with a battle, because/which before/earlier on the hillock
Afranius' troops had come,
are repelled by our troops
and other reinforcements having been relieved, to turn the rear
and they are forced to accept a legion to the standard.
