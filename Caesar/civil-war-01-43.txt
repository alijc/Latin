Book I section  [43] 

Erat inter oppidum Ilerdam et proximum collem, ubi castra
Petreius atque Afranius habebant, planities circiter passuum
CCC, atque in hoc fere medio spatio tumulus erat paulo
editior; quem si occupavisset Caesar et communisset, ab
oppido et ponte et commeatu omni, quem in oppidum
contulerant, se interclusurum adversarios confidebat.  Hoc
sperans legiones III ex castris educit acieque in locis
idoneis instructa unius legionis antesignanos procurrere
atque eum tumulum occupare iubet.  Qua re cognita celeriter
quae in statione pro castris erant Afranii cohortes breviore
itinere ad eundem occupandum locum mittuntur.  Contenditur
proelio, et quod prius in tumulum Afraniani venerant, nostri
repelluntur atque aliis submissis subsidiis terga vertere
seque ad signa legionum recipere coguntur.



Between the town of Ilerda and the next hill, where Petreius
and Afranius had their camp, there was a flat spot about 300
paces across, and very nearly in the middle of this space
was a small hillock.  If Caesar could capture and fortify
it, then he was confident that he could block his oppponents
from the town and the bridge and from all the supplies that
they'd gathered in the town, In hopes of this he led three
legions out of the camp and, after drawing a battle line up
in suitable positions, he ordered the front ranks of one
legion to run ahead and capture the hillock.  Afranius
quickly learned of this and sent his cohorts, which were in
the outposts in front of the camp, by a shorter route to
capture the same position.  It's disputed in battle and,
since Afranius' trooips had gotten to the hillock first,
ours are repelled, and after more reinforcements are sent
in, they are forced to turn tail and retreat to the standard
of the legions.
