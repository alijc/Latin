Book I section [44]  

Genus erat pugnae militum illorum,
 ut magno impetu primo procurrerent,
 audacter locum caperent,
 ordines suos non magnopere servarent,
 rari dispersique pugnarent; 

There was a sort of fighting of those soldiers,
 that they would first charge in a powerful attack 
 to boldly capture the position,
 they wouldn't keep their ranks overly much,
 they might fight scattered and dispersed;

si premerentur,
 pedem referre et loco excedere non turpe existimarent
 cum Lusitanis reliquisque barbaris barbaro genere quodam pugnae assuefacti;

if they were hard pressed,
 they wouldn't reckon it disgraceful to retreat and withdraw from the position, 
 with Lusitanus' troops and the rest of the foreigners by a certain sort of
 foreigner trained to fighting;


quod fere fit, quibus quisque in locis miles inveteraverit,
 ut multum earum regionum consuetudine moveatur. 

that is fiercely contended, wherein each soldier might settle in the country,
 so that he might move with great familiarity of his own regions.


Haec tum ratio nostros perturbavit insuetos huius generis pugnae: 

At the time this course confused our men, unaccustomed to this sort of fighting:


circumiri enim sese ab aperto latere procurrentibus singulis arbitrabantur; 

for they thought that they were outflanked on their unprotected side
in charging separately;


ipsi autem suos ordines servare neque ab signis discedere
 neque sine gravi causa eum locum,
 quem ceperant, dimitti censuerant oportere. 

but they themselves thought it necessary to be released to hold their ranks and
not abandon the position that they'd captured without a serious reason,


Itaque perturbatis antesignanis legio, quae in eo cornu constiterat,
 locum non tenuit atque in proximum collem sese recepit.

And so, with the advance troops in disarray, the legion, 
 which had made a stand on its wing,
 did not hold its position and retreated to the neighboring hill.
