Book I section [44]  

Genus erat pugnae militum illorum, ut magno impetu primo procurrerent,
audacter locum caperent, ordines suos non magnopere servarent, rari
dispersique pugnarent; si premerentur, pedem referre et loco excedere non
turpe existimarent cum Lusitanis reliquisque barbaris barbaro genere quodam
pugnae assuefacti; quod fere fit, quibus quisque in locis miles
inveteraverit, ut multum earum regionum consuetudine moveatur.  Haec tum
ratio nostros perturbavit insuetos huius generis pugnae: circumiri enim sese
ab aperto latere procurrentibus singulis arbitrabantur; ipsi autem suos
ordines servare neque ab signis discedere neque sine gravi causa eum locum,
quem ceperant, dimitti censuerant oportere.  Itaque perturbatis antesignanis
legio, quae in eo cornu constiterat, locum non tenuit atque in proximum
collem sese recepit.



Those soldiers had a manner of fighting where they would first charge
in a powerful attack to boldly capture a position, not holding their
ranks overly much, but fighting scattered and dispersed.  If they
were hard pressed, they didn't count it as a disgrace to retreat and
withdraw from the position, having gotten accustomed to fighting this
way with the Lusitanians and other barbarians, as often happens when
any soldier lives a long time in a country, so that he is affected
with a great familiarity of the region.  At the time this course of
action confused our men, who were unaccustomed to this sort of
fighting: for they thought that they were being outflanked on their
unprotected side by those advancing disjointedly; but they themselves
thought it necessary to hold their ranks and not abandon the position
that they'd captured without a serious reason.  And so, with the
first ranks in disarray, the legion, which had halted on that wing,
did not hold its position and retreated to the neighboring hill.
