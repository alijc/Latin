Book I section [44]  

Genus erat pugnae militum illorum,
 ut magno impetu primo procurrerent,
 audacter locum caperent,
 ordines suos non magnopere servarent,
 rari dispersique pugnarent; 

The rank of the battle was of those soldiers,
 so that by a powerful attack at first they could run out ahead,
 they might boldly capture the spot,
 they might not particularly guard our ranks,
 they might fight scattered and dispersed;

si premerentur,
 pedem referre et loco excedere non turpe existimarent
 cum Lusitanis reliquisque barbaris barbaro genere quodam pugnae assuefacti;

if they were pressed hard,
 they wouldn't disgracefully judge to retreat and to withdraw from the place 
 with Lusitanus' troops and the rest of the foreigners by a certain sort of
 foreigner trained to battle;


quod fere fit, quibus quisque in locis miles inveteraverit,
 ut multum earum regionum consuetudine moveatur. 

that/because it is nearly made, to/by whom and whom-all a soldier  might grow
old/become established in the localities,
 so that he might move much of his regions.


Haec tum ratio nostros perturbavit insuetos huius generis pugnae: 

Then this plan confused our unaccustomed men by this type of fighting:


circumiri enim sese ab aperto latere procurrentibus singulis arbitrabantur; 

for to be encircled themselves by the open flank they were considered by running
ahead apiece;


ipsi autem suos ordines servare neque ab signis discedere
 neque sine gravi causa eum locum,
 quem ceperant, dimitti censuerant oportere. 

but they themselves ... to protect their own ranks and not withdraw from the
standards without a serious reason the location,
that they had judged, the judged to require to be sent away.


Itaque perturbatis antesignanis legio, quae in eo cornu constiterat,
 locum non tenuit atque in proximum collem sese recepit.

And so, having confused the skirmishers, the legion, 
 which had made a stand on its wing,
 did not hold its position and retreated to the neighboring hill.
