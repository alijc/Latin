Book I section [45]   

Caesar paene omni acie perterrita,
 quod praeter opinionem consuetudinemque acciderat,
 cohortatus suos legionem nonam subsidio ducit; 

Caesar, with his whole battle array all but terrified,
because what had happened was contrary to expectation and custom,
after encouraging his men, leads the ninth legion in for reinforcements;


hostem insolenter atque acriter nostros insequentem supprimit
 rursusque terga vertere seque ad oppidum Ilerdam recipere
 et sub muro consistere cogit. 

he excessively and fiercely checks our men, the pursued enemy,
and assembles our men to turn and withdraw to the town of Ilerda,
to stand fast under the wall.


Sed nonae legionis milites elati studio,
 dum sarcire acceptum detrimentum volunt,
 temere insecuti longius fugientes in locum iniquum progrediuntur
 et sub montem,
 in quo erat oppidum positum Ilerda,
 succedunt. 

But the soldiers of the ninth legion, carried away in their zeal
and wishing to make good the loss that they'd recieved,
after rashly pursuing the fleeing men further unto a slope they
go on and advance up to the mountain that the town of Ilerda was on.


Hinc se recipere cum vellent, rursus illi ex loco superiore nostros premebant. 

They'd rather withdraw from here, as the others pressed our
men hard from higher ground.


Praeruptus locus erat utraque ex parte derectus
 ac tantum in latitudinem patebat,
 ut tres instructae cohortes eum locum explerent,
 ut neque subsidia ab lateribus submitti
 neque equites laborantibus usui esse possent. 

The steep site was partly level and extended just wide enough for
three armed cohorts to fill it completely,
so that reinforcements could not be sent in from the flanks,
neither could the cavalry could be put to use for those in distress.


Ab oppido autem declivis locus tenui fastigio vergebat in longitudinem passuum
circiter CCCC. 

But from the town the place sloped down from a slight elevation 
for about four miles.


Hac nostris erat receptus,
 quod eo incitati studio inconsultius processerant; 

By this it was retreated by our men,
because by it they had advanced urged on by overly rash zeal;


hoc pugnabatur loco,
 et propter angustias iniquo
 et quod sub ipsis radicibus montis constiterant,
 ut nullum frustra telum in eos mitteretur. 

this was fought by the place,
and on account of the narrow passes disadvantageously
and because they had made a stand at the very foot of the mountains,
so that no spear was hurled into them.


Tamen virtute et patientia nitebantur atque omnia vulnera sustinebant. 

Nevertheless by courage and hardiness they advanced and endured all their wounds.


Augebatur illis copia,
 atque ex castris cohortes per oppidum crebro submittebantur,
 ut integri defessis succederent. 

An ample supply was augmented by them,
and the cohorts were frequently relieved from the camp by way of the town,
so that fresh troops succeeded the exhausted ones.


Hoc idem Caesar facere cogebatur,
 ut submissis in eundem locum cohortibus defessos reciperet.

Caesar himself was summoned to do this,
so that by/to the relieved in the same place might take in the exhausted men by
the cohorts.
