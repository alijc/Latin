Book I section [45]   

Caesar paene omni acie perterrita, quod praeter opinionem
consuetudinemque acciderat, cohortatus suos legionem nonam
subsidio ducit; hostem insolenter atque acriter nostros
insequentem supprimit rursusque terga vertere seque ad
oppidum Ilerdam recipere et sub muro consistere cogit.  Sed
nonae legionis milites elati studio, dum sarcire acceptum
detrimentum volunt, temere insecuti longius fugientes in
locum iniquum progrediuntur et sub montem, in quo erat
oppidum positum Ilerda, succedunt.  Hinc se recipere cum
vellent, rursus illi ex loco superiore nostros premebant.
Praeruptus locus erat utraque ex parte derectus ac tantum in
latitudinem patebat, ut tres instructae cohortes eum locum
explerent, ut neque subsidia ab lateribus submitti neque
equites laborantibus usui esse possent.  Ab oppido autem
declivis locus tenui fastigio vergebat in longitudinem
passuum circiter CCCC.  Hac nostris erat receptus, quod eo
incitati studio inconsultius processerant; hoc pugnabatur
loco, et propter angustias iniquo et quod sub ipsis radicibus
montis constiterant, ut nullum frustra telum in eos
mitteretur.  Tamen virtute et patientia nitebantur atque
omnia vulnera sustinebant.  Augebatur illis copia, atque ex
castris cohortes per oppidum crebro submittebantur, ut
integri defessis succederent.  Hoc idem Caesar facere
cogebatur, ut submissis in eundem locum cohortibus defessos
reciperet.



Caesar, with his whole battle array on the verge of panic,
because what had happened was contrary to expectation and
custom, rallies his men and leads the ninth legion in
as reinforcements.  He checks the enemy that are excessively
and fiercely pursuing our men, and forces them to turn and
withdraw to the town of Ilerda, to make a stand under the
wall.  But the soldiers of the ninth legion, carried away in
their zeal and wishing to redeem the loss that they'd
recieved, after rashly pursuing the fleeing men further unto
a slope they go on and advance up to the mountain that the
town of Ilerda was on.  When they wished to withdraw from
here, the enemy attacked our men from the higher ground.  The
steep site was uneven and just wide enough for three armed
cohorts to fit in it, so that reinforcements could not be
sent in from the flanks, neither could the cavalry could be
put to use for those in distress.  But from the town the
place sloped down from a slight elevation for about four
hundred paces, which gave our men a means of retreat from the
place that they had advanced urged on by overly rash zeal.
The battle was waged in this spot, and on account of the
steep, narrow passes and because they'd made a stand at the
very foot of the mountains, no spear was cast into them to no
purpose.  Nevertheless by courage and hardiness they
sustained themselves and endured all their wounds.  The
enemy's troops kept increasing, and their cohorts were
frequently relieved from the camp by way of the town, so that
fresh troops succeeded the exhausted ones.  Caesar himself
was forced to do the same, sending in cohorts to the same
position to relieve exhausted men.
