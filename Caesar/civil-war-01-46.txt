Book I section [46] 

Hoc cum esset modo pugnatum continenter horis quinque
nostrique gravius a multitudine premerentur, consumptis
omnibus telis gladiis destrictis impetum adversus montem in
cohortes faciunt, paucisque deiectis reliquos sese convertere
cogunt.  Submotis sub murum cohortibus ac nonnullam partem
propter terrorem in oppidum compulsis facilis est nostris
receptus datus.  Equitatus autem noster ab utroque latere,
etsi deiectis atque inferioribus locis constiterat, tamen
summa in iugum virtute connititur atque inter duas acies
perequitans commodiorem ac tutiorem nostris receptum dat.  Ita
vario certamine pugnatum est.  Nostri in primo congressu
circiter LXX ceciderunt, in his Q. Fulginius ex primo hastato
legionis XIIII, qui propter eximiam virtutem ex inferioribus
ordinibus in eum locum pervenerat; vulnerantur amplius DC.  Ex
Afranianis interficiuntur T. Caecilius, primi pili centurio,
et praeter eum centuriones IIII, milites amplius CC.



After the battle had raged in this way for five hours without
pause and our men, pressed hard by greater numbers, had used
up all their javelins, they drew their swords and attacked the
mountain in cohorts, and after a few were cut down they forced
the rest to withdraw.  With the cohorts dislodged from under
the wall and driven into the town in several places on account
of their panic, our men gained an easy retreat.  Moreover, our
cavalry, although it had been driven out from both flanks and
was in an inferior position, nevertheless strained the yoke
with the greatest courage and, riding between the two battle
lines it covered our men and covered our men's retreat.  Thus
the battle raged over various actions.  About 70 of our men
fell in the first clash.  Among these was Q. Fulginius, from
the first rank of the 14th legion, who had been promoted to
that position due to his extraordinary courage.  More than 600
were wounded.  Of Afranicus' men T. Caecilius, the first
centurion, and four other centurions, along with more than 200
soldiers were killed.
