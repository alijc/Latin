Book I section [47] 

Sed haec eius diei praefertur opinio, ut se utrique superiores
discessisse existimarent: Afraniani, quod, cum esse omnium
iudicio inferiores viderentur, comminus tam diu stetissent et
nostrorum impetum sustinuissent et initio locum tumulumque
tenuissent, quae causa pugnandi fuerat, et nostros primo
congressu terga vertere coegissent; nostri autem, quod iniquo
loco atque impari congressi numero quinque horis proelium
sustinuissent, quod montem gladiis destrictis ascendissent,
quod ex loco superiore terga vertere adversarios coegissent
atque in oppidum compulissent.  Illi eum tumulum, pro quo
pugnatum est, magnis operibus munierunt praesidiumque ibi
posuerunt.




But the revelation about that day is how each side considered
that they had come out on top.  Afranius' men because,
although everyone had deemed them inferior, they had stood
firm in close combat all day and had withstood our men's
attack, and from the beginning had held their position on the
hill that had been the reason for the fight and had forced our
men to turn tail in their first encounter.  Our men, on the
other hand, because they had borne up despite their
unfavorable position and, after fighting against uneven odds
for five hours had climbed the mountain with drawn swords and
had forced their adversaries to retreat from the higher ground
and driven them into the town.  Afranius' men fortified the
hill that they'd done battle for with many works and stationed
a garrison there.
