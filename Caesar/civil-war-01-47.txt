Accidit etiam repentinum incommodum biduo, quo haec gesta sunt.

Furthermore, something unexpected and inconvenient happens for two days,
by which these things were borne.


Tanta enim tempestas cooritur,
 ut numquam illis locis maiores aquas fuisse constaret. 

For such storms arise, 
 so that never in those parts was said to be more water.


Tum autem ex omnibus montibus nives proluit
 ac summas ripas fluminis superavit pontesque ambo,
 quos C. Fabius fecerat, uno die interrupit. 

But then out of all the mountains snows wash(ed) away
and overcome the highest banks of the river and bridges both,
That C. Fabius had built, broken up in a single day.


Quae res magnas difficultates exercitui Caesaris attulit. 

Which thing brought great difficulties to Caesar's army.


Castra enim, ut supra demonstratum est, cum essent inter flumina duo,
 Sicorim et Cingam, spatio milium XXX, neutrum horum transiri poterat,
 necessarioque omnes his angustiis continebantur.

For the camp, as has been already described, since it was between two rivers,
Sicori and Cinga, in a space of 300 paces, neither of these could be crossed,
and by necessity all these were being confined in a narrow space.


Neque civitates, quae ad Caesaris amicitiam accesserant,
 frumentum supportare, neque ei, qui pabulatum longius progressi erant,
 interclusi fluminibus reverti neque maximi commeatus,
 qui ex Italia Galliaque veniebant, in castra pervenire poterant. 

Neither the towns, which to Caesar had approached friendship,
to transport supplies, nor those, who had advanced far off forage,
cut off by the rivers, turned back and not with the greatest provisions,
who were coming out of Italy and Gaul, could reach the camp.


Tempus erat autem difficillimum,
 quo neque frumenta in hibernis erant neque multum a maturitate aberant;

But the time was very difficult,
by whihc neither the supplies were in winters nor were far from ripe;


 ac civitates exinanitae,
 quod Afranius paene omne frumentum ante Caesaris adventum Ilerdam convexerat,
 reliqui si quid fuerat,
 Caesar superioribus diebus consumpserat; 

and the emptied towns,
that Afranius nearly all supplies before Caesar's arrival had conveyed to
Ilerda, the rest if anything had been,
Caesar had eaten up in the recent days;


pecora, quod secundum poterat esse inopiae subsidium,
 propter bellum finitimae civitates longius removerant. 

the cattle, that next he could to be a relief of want,
on account of the war the neighboring towns had removed a long time ago.


Qui erant pabulandi aut frumentandi causa progressi,
 hos levis armaturae Lusitani peritique earum regionum
 cetrati citerioris Hispaniae consectabantur;

Those who were foraging and foraging on account of having advanced,
those of light armor of Lusitanians and skilled of the regions
armed with a light shield on the side of Spain they were pursuing;


quibus erat proclive tranare flumen,
 quod consuetudo eorum omnium est,
 ut sine utribus ad exercitum non eant.

to/by which was sloping down to swim across the river,
which by/to their custom is of all,
so that without skin to the army they do not go.
