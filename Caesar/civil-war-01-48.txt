Accidit etiam repentinum incommodum biduo, quo haec gesta sunt.
Tanta enim tempestas cooritur, ut numquam illis locis maiores
aquas fuisse constaret.  Tum autem ex omnibus montibus nives
proluit ac summas ripas fluminis superavit pontesque ambo, quos
C. Fabius fecerat, uno die interrupit.  Quae res magnas
difficultates exercitui Caesaris attulit.  Castra enim, ut supra
demonstratum est, cum essent inter flumina duo, Sicorim et
Cingam, spatio milium XXX, neutrum horum transiri poterat,
necessarioque omnes his angustiis continebantur.  Neque
civitates, quae ad Caesaris amicitiam accesserant, frumentum
supportare, neque ei, qui pabulatum longius progressi erant,
interclusi fluminibus reverti neque maximi commeatus, qui ex
Italia Galliaque veniebant, in castra pervenire poterant.  Tempus
erat autem difficillimum, quo neque frumenta in hibernis erant
neque multum a maturitate aberant; ac civitates exinanitae, quod
Afranius paene omne frumentum ante Caesaris adventum Ilerdam
convexerat, reliqui si quid fuerat, Caesar superioribus diebus
consumpserat; pecora, quod secundum poterat esse inopiae
subsidium, propter bellum finitimae civitates longius removerant.
Qui erant pabulandi aut frumentandi causa progressi, hos levis
armaturae Lusitani peritique earum regionum cetrati citerioris
Hispaniae consectabantur; quibus erat proclive tranare flumen,
quod consuetudo eorum omnium est, ut sine utribus ad exercitum
non eant.



Furthermore, two days later something unexpected and inconvenient
occurred.  For such a storm arose that it was said that there had
never been so much water in those parts.  And then snowmelt from
all the mountains overtopped the banks of the river, and both the
bridges that C. Fabius had built were swept away in a single day.
And this matter brought great difficulties to Caesar's army.  For
the camp, as has been already described, was between two rivers,
the Sicoris and the Cinga, neither of which could be crossed
within 30 miles, and by necessity everyone was confined in a
narrow space.  The towns, that had undertaken an alliance with
Caesar for transporting his supplies, could not reach the camp.
Neither could the men who were out foraging far afield and who
had been cut off and turned back by the rivers, or those who were
coming from Italy and Gaul with a great amount of provisions.
Moreover it was the most difficult time of year, when the grain
was not yet in storage and not quite ripe.  And the towns were
desolate, because before Caesar's arrival Afranius had all but
emptied them of supplies, which he'd transported to Ilerda, and
in the last few days Caesar had used up whatever had been left.
And due to the war the neighboring towns had driven off the
cattle, which could have been a secondary reserve.  Those who
were out foraging and gathering grain were harassed by the
lightly-armed Lusitanians, and shield-bearers of nearer Spain,
who were well-acquainted with the region.  who were ready to swim
across the river, because the custom of all of them is that they
don't go into the army without carrying swim bladders.
