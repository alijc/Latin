[49] At exercitus Afranii omnium rerum abundabat copia. Multum erat
frumentum provisum et convectum superioribus temporibus, multum ex
omni provincia comportabatur; magna copia pabuli suppetebat. Harum
omnium rerum facultates sine ullo periculo pons Ilerdae praebebat et
loca trans flumen integra, quo omnino Caesar adire non poterat.

But Afranius' army had all supplies in abundance.
There was much grain provided and collected from the previous season,
much was brought in from the whole province;
many supplies of fodder were at hand.
Of all these things the means without any danger the bridge of Ilerda
supplied and untouched places across the river,
by all of which Caesar could not approach.
