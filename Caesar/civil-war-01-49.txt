[49] At exercitus Afranii omnium rerum abundabat copia. Multum erat
frumentum provisum et convectum superioribus temporibus, multum ex
omni provincia comportabatur; magna copia pabuli suppetebat. Harum
omnium rerum facultates sine ullo periculo pons Ilerdae praebebat et
loca trans flumen integra, quo omnino Caesar adire non poterat.

But Afranius' army had abundant supplies of everything.  Much grain
had been provisioned and stored from the previous season, much was
being brought in from the whole province; a large supply of fodder
was at hand.  Ilerda's bridge supplied access, without any danger,
to all of these things and to unexhausted places across the river,
which Caesar could not reach at all.
