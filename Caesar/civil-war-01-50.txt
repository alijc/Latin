[50] Hae permanserunt aquae dies complures. Conatus est Caesar
reficere pontes; sed nec magnitudo fluminis permittebat, neque ad
ripam dispositae cohortes adversariorum perfici patiebantur. Quod
illis prohibere erat facile cum ipsius fluminis natura atque aquae
magnitudine, tum quod ex totis ripis in unum atque angustum locum tela
iaciebantur; atque erat difficile eodem tempore rapidissimo flumine
opera perficere et tela vitare.

These waters remained for several days.
Caesar attempted to rebuild the bridges;
but the magnitude of the river did not permit it, 
nor did the enemy cohorts that had been positioned on the shore allow it.
What/because to/by them to hinder it/he was easy with the nature of that river
and the height of the water, then what/that/because out of the whole backs in
one and a narrow spot spears were thrown;
and it was difficult at the time by the swift current to complete the work
and avoid the spears.
