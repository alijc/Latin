His tamen omnibus annona crevit; quae fere res non solum inopia
praesentis, sed etiam futuri temporis timore ingravescere
consuevit.  Iamque ad denarios L in singulos modios annona
pervenerat, et militum vires inopia frumenti deminuerat, atque
incommoda in dies augebantur; et ita paucis diebus magna erat
facta rerum commutatio ac se fortuna inclinaverat, ut nostri
magna inopia necessariarum rerum conflictarentur, illi omnibus
abundarent rebus superioresque haberentur.  Caesar eis
civitatibus, quae ad eius amicitiam accesserant, quod minor erat
frumenti copia, pecus imperabat; calones ad longinquiores
civitates dimittebat; ipse praesentem inopiam quibus poterat
subsidiis tutabatur.


Nevertheless, the cost of provisions increased from all of this;
which were not only in short supply at present, but were also
feared to get worse in the future.  Already the price of grain
had reached 50 denarii a peck, and the lack of grain had reduced
the soldiers' strength, and the losses had been increasing for
days.  Within a few days the change was so great and our fortune
had grown worse, that while our men were ruined by their great
want of necessities, the enemy's had an abundance of everything
and might be held as the victors.  Because there was less grain,
Caesar ordered cattled from the towns that had entered into an
alliance with him, he sent the soldiers' servants away to the
rear; he himself was guarding against the current lack with
whatever aid he could muster.
