His tamen omnibus annona crevit;
 quae fere res non solum inopia praesentis,
 sed etiam futuri temporis timore ingravescere consuevit. 

Nevertheless, our provisions were increased because of all of these;
which thing nearly not just lacking in the present circumstance,
but also of future time by dread to grow heavy he was accustomed.


Iamque ad denarios L in singulos modios annona pervenerat,
 et militum vires inopia frumenti deminuerat,
 atque incommoda in dies augebantur;
 et ita paucis diebus magna erat facta rerum commutatio
 ac se fortuna inclinaverat,
 ut nostri magna inopia necessariarum rerum conflictarentur,
 illi omnibus abundarent rebus superioresque haberentur. 

And already/yet the provisions had come to 50 silver coins per peck,
and of the soldiers the men lack of grain had reduced,
and the setbacks were increasing within days;
and so in a few days an alteration of the things was great deeds
and fortune had grown worse,
so that our great want of necessities was assailed,
to him/they to/by all things might abound and they were held the highest.


Caesar eis civitatibus,
 quae ad eius amicitiam accesserant,
 quod minor erat frumenti copia, pecus imperabat;
 calones ad longinquiores civitates dimittebat;
 ipse praesentem inopiam quibus poterat subsidiis tutabatur.

Caesar, to/by the towns,
which to his friendship had agreed,
because/that it was less supply of grain, he ordered cattle;
he sent away the soldiers' servants to the rear;
he himself might guard the current lack to/by who he could by/to relief.
