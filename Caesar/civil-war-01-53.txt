Haec Afranius Petreiusque et eorum amici pleniora etiam atque
uberiora Romam ad suos perscribebant; multa rumor affingebat,
ut paene bellum confectum videretur.  Quibus litteris
nuntiisque Romam perlatis magni domum concursus ad Afranium
magnaeque gratulationes fiebant; multi ex Italia ad
Cn. Pompeium proficiscebantur, alii, ut principes talem
nuntium attulisse, alii ne eventum belli exspectasse aut ex
omnibus novissimi venisse viderentur.

Afranius and Petreius and their friends reported these
matters completely and even more so to their friends in Rome.
Hearsay was adding many embellishments, so that it almost
seemed that the war was over.  When these letters and
messages were carried to Rome an assembly of the nobility
gathered at Afranius' house and many congratulations were
passed about.  Many men set out from Italy to Cn. Pompey,
some, to be first in bringing him such excellent news,
others, so that it wouldn't look like they'd waited for the
outcome of the war or to have been the last ones to show up.
