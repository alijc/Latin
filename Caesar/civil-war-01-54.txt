[54] 

Cum in his angustiis res esset, atque omnes viae ab Afranianis
militibus equitibusque obsiderentur, nec pontes perfici
possent, imperat militibus Caesar, ut naves faciant, cuius
generis eum superioribus annis usus Britanniae docuerat.
Carinae ac prima statumina ex levi materia fiebant; reliquum
corpus navium viminibus contextum coriis integebatur.  Has
perfectas carris iunctis devehit noctu milia passuum a castris
XXII militesque his navibus flumen transportat continentemque
ripae collem improviso occupat.  Hunc celeriter, priusquam ab
adversariis sentiatur, communit.  Huc legionem postea traicit
atque ex utraque parte pontem instituit, biduo perficit.  Ita
commeatus et qui frumenti causa processerant tuto ad se
recipit et rem frumentariam expedire incipit.


Since the business was in these straits, with all the roads
clogged with Afranius' soldiers and cavalry and the bridges
impossible to complete, Caesar ordered the soldiers to make
boats, a better sort of boat, that he'd seen used in Britain.
The keels and ribs were made from lightweight wood; while the
rest of the body was made from twigs woven together and
covered with hides.  Once completed, he conveyed these by
joined wagons 22 miles from the camp by night and used them
to transport soldiers across the river.  There he stealthily
occupied the high ground adjacent to the shore, and fortified
it with great speed, before the enemy knew he was there.  He
next transported a legion to that spot and built a bridge
working from both ends, finishing it in two days.  And so he
safely recovered his supplies along with the men who had gone
out foraging, and began to secure his grain supply.
