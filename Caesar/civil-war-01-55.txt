55.1 

Eodem die equitum magnam partem flumen traiecit.  Qui inopinantes
pabulatores et sine ullo dissipatos timore aggressi magnum
numerum iumentorum atque hominum intercipiunt cohortibusque
cetratis subsidio missis scienter in duas partes sese
distribuunt, alii ut praedae praesidio sint, alii ut venientibus
resistant atque eos propellant, unamque cohortem, quae temere
ante ceteras extra aciem procurrerat, seclusam ab reliquis
circumveniunt atque interficiunt incolumesque cum magna praeda
eodem ponte in castra revertuntur.


On the same day he transported a large portion of his cavalry
over the river.  And they caught the dispersed foragers
unawares, and seized a large number of mules and men.  After
some shield-bearing cohorts had been sent for their relief they
skillfully divided themselves into two parts, some to guard the
spoils, and others to make a stand against and drive off the
approaching troops.  They encircled and destroyed one cohort
that had rashly run out in front of the others beyond the line
of battle and was far from the others, and returned safely to
camp on the same bridge with a great deal of plunder.
