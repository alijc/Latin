55.1 

Eodem die equitum magnam partem flumen traiecit. 

Qui inopinantes pabulatores et
 sine ullo dissipatos timore aggressi magnum numerum iumentorum
 atque hominum intercipiunt
 cohortibusque cetratis subsidio missis scienter in duas partes sese
 distribuunt,
 alii ut praedae praesidio sint,
 alii ut venientibus resistant atque eos propellant,
 unamque cohortem,
 quae temere ante ceteras extra aciem procurrerat,
 seclusam ab reliquis circumveniunt atque interficiunt
 incolumesque cum magna praeda eodem ponte in castra revertuntur.


On the same day the river transported a great part of the cavalry.

Those cut off the off-guard foragers and scattered men
with no fear of the approach a number of mules and men  
and by/to shield-carrying/lightly armed cohorts to/by relief
 to/by messengers/men having been sent skillfully divided themselves into two
 parts,
some to be a guard of the spoils,
some/others to make a stand to/by coming and to drive them off,
and they encircled and destroyed one cohort,
which had rashly run out before the rest beyond the line of battle,
and was far from the others,
and returned safely with a great plunder on the same bridge into the camp.
