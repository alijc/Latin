Dum haec ad Ilerdam geruntur, Massilienses usi L. Domitii
consilio naves longas expediunt numero XVII, quarum erant
XI tectae.  Multa huc minora navigia addunt, ut ipsa
multitudine nostra classis terreatur.  Magnum numerum
sagittariorum, magnum Albicorum, de quibus supra
demonstratum est, imponunt atque hos praemiis
pollicitationibusque incitant.  Certas sibi deposcit naves
Domitius atque has colonis pastoribusque, quos secum
adduxerat, complet.  Sic omnibus rebus instructa classe
magna fiducia ad nostras naves procedunt, quibus praeerat
D. Brutus.  Hae ad insulam, quae est contra Massiliam,
stationes obtinebant.


While these events were taking place at Ilerda, the
Masislians, having made use of L Domitius' plan, ready
galleys, 17 in number, of which 11 were decked.  They add
many smaller ships to these, in order to frighten our fleet
by its great size.  They station a great number of archers
and Albicans, who have been described above, and rouse
these with rewards and promises.  Domitius demands certain
ships for himself, and he fills these with farmers and
shepherds that he had brought with him.  And so, in their
fitted out fleet, they proceeded towards our ships, which
were under the command of D. Brutus.  These ships held
their station by an island that is opposite Massilia.
