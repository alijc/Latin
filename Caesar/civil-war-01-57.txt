[57] 

Erat multo inferior numero navium Brutus; sed electos ex omnibus
legionibus fortissimos viros, antesignanos, centuriones, Caesar ei
classi attribuerat, qui sibi id muneris depoposcerant.  Hi manus
ferreas atque harpagones paraverant magnoque numero pilorum,
tragularum reliquorumque telorum se instruxerant.  Ita cognito
hostium adventu suas naves ex portu educunt, cum Massiliensibus
confligunt.  Pugnatum est utrimque fortissime atque acerrime; neque
multum Albici nostris virtute cedebant, homines asperi et montani,
exercitati in armis; atque hi modo digressi a Massiliensibus recentem
eorum pollicitationem animis continebant, pastoresque Domitii spe
libertatis excitati sub oculis domini suam probare operam studebant.

Brutus had a much smaller number of ships; but Caesar had picked out,
from all the legions, the strongest men, the commanders and
centurions who had demanded this duty for themselves, and had
assigned them to the fleet.  These men had prepared grappling hooks
and had equipped themselves with a great many javelins and darts and
the rest of the spears.  So, when they learn of the enemy's approach,
they put out to sea and engage the Massilians.  The battle was waged
on both sides most boldly and bitterly; and the Albicians did not
yield much to our strength.  They were rough men from the mountains,
experienced in arms; and as they had just left Massilia they kept the
recent promises to them in mind.  And Domitius' shepherds, who had
been encouraged with the hope of liberty, were eager to prove their
service under the eyes of their master.
