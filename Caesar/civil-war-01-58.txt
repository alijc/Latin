Ipsi Massilienses et celeritate navium et scientia gubernatorum
confisi nostros eludebant impetusque eorum excipiebant et, quoad
licebat latiore uti spatio, producta longius acie circumvenire nostros
aut pluribus navibus adoriri singulas aut remos transcurrentes
detergere, si possent, contendebant; cum propius erat necessario
ventum, ab scientia gubernatorum atque artificiis ad virtutem
montanorum confugiebant.  Nostri cum minus exercitatis remigibus
minusque peritis gubernatoribus utebantur, qui repente ex onerariis
navibus erant producti neque dum etiam vocabulis armamentorum
cognitis, tum etiam tarditate et gravitate navium impediebantur;
factae enim subito ex humida materia non eundem usum celeritatis
habebant.  Itaque, dum locus comminus pugnandi daretur, aequo animo
singulas binis navibus obiciebant atque iniecta manu ferrea et retenta
utraque nave diversi pugnabant atque in hostium naves transcendebant
et magno numero Albicorum et pastorum interfecto partem navium
deprimunt, nonnullas cum hominibus capiunt, reliquas in portum
compellunt.  Eo die naves Massiliensium cum eis, quae sunt captae,
intereunt VIIII.


The Massilians themselves, relying on both the speed of their ships
and the skill of their helmsmen, eluded the attacks of our forces.
For as long as they were able to make use of a broad extent of sea,
they strove to extend their battle-line to encircle our forces, or to
attack our ships singly with many of theirs, or to break our oars to
pieces by sailing through them.  When it came to closer fighting, they
would of necessity turn from the skill and experience of their
helmsmen and to the courage of their mountaineers.  Our forces were
using less experienced oarsmen and less skilled helmsmen, who had been
suddenly brought forward from the cargo ships and had not yet learned
the designations of the rigging.  At the same time they were also
burdened with the sluggishness and the ponderousness of the ships;
for, having been built quickly from unseasoned wood, they didn't have
the use of speed.  Even so, when an opportunity for close fighting was
offered, with flat-out courage they would throw each of their ships
between two of the enemy's and after hurling a grappling-hook into a
ship, would separately give battle and board the enemy ships and,
having killed a great number of Albicans and shepherds, they sink some
of the ships and capture several along with their crews, while driving
the rest back into the harbor.  On that day the Massilians lost 9
ships, including the ones that were captured.
