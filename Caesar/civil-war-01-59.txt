Hoc primum Caesari ad Ilerdam nuntiatur;
 simul perfecto ponte celeriter fortuna mutatur. 

Illi perterriti virtute equitum minus libere,
 minus audacter vagabantur,
alias non longo a castris progressi spatio,
 ut celerem receptum haberent,
 angustius pabulabantur, 
alias longiore circuitu custodias stationesque equitum vitabant,
 aut aliquo accepto detrimento aut procul equitatu viso ex medio itinere
 proiectis sarcinis fugiebant. 

Postremo et plures intermittere dies et praeter consuetudinem omnium noctu
constituerant pabulari. 


this first to Caesar is reported at Ilerda;
at the same time the bridge having been completed quickly his luck changes.

they, terrified by the army of horsemen a little frankly,
a little boldly were wandering,
some not far/long out of camp having marched out,
 to have/hold a quick retreat,
 were foraging somewhat crampedly,
others on a longer circuit were avoiding the pickets and horsemen,
 or by anyone having received defeat or at a distance having seen cavalry on the
 march they would flee, having thrown down their packs.

at last both to interrupt the days and contrary to custom of all by night
theay decided to forage.
