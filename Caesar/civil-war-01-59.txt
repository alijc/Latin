59.1 

Hoc primum Caesari ad Ilerdam nuntiatur; simul perfecto ponte
celeriter fortuna mutatur.  Illi perterriti virtute equitum
minus libere, minus audacter vagabantur, alias non longo a
castris progressi spatio, ut celerem receptum haberent,
angustius pabulabantur, alias longiore circuitu custodias
stationesque equitum vitabant, aut aliquo accepto detrimento aut
procul equitatu viso ex medio itinere proiectis sarcinis
fugiebant.  Postremo et plures intermittere dies et praeter
consuetudinem omnium noctu constituerant pabulari.


This is first reported to Caesar at Ilerda, at the same time as
the bridge is completed.  His luck changes at once.  The enemy
were not ranging as freely, frightened by the courage of our
horsemen.  Some were foraging near at hand, going only a little
way from camp so as to have a short retreat.  Others were making
a wide circuit to avoid our pickets and horsemen, and would
throw down their packs and flee at the slightest reverse, or
even because they'd seen our cavalry on the road at a distance.
In the end they, contrary to custom, decided to leave off
foraging for many days and switched to doing it in the night.
