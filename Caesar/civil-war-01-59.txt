Hoc primum Caesari ad Ilerdam nuntiatur;
 simul perfecto ponte celeriter fortuna mutatur. 

Illi perterriti virtute equitum minus libere,
 minus audacter vagabantur,
alias non longo a castris progressi spatio,
 ut celerem receptum haberent,
 angustius pabulabantur, 
alias longiore circuitu custodias stationesque equitum vitabant,
 aut aliquo accepto detrimento aut procul equitatu viso ex medio itinere
 proiectis sarcinis fugiebant. 

Postremo et plures intermittere dies et praeter consuetudinem omnium noctu
constituerant pabulari. 


This is first reported to Caesar at Ilerda,
at the same time as the bridge is completed.
His luck changes at once.

They were wandering about, frankly, a little terrified by the army of horsemen,
a little boldly.
Some were foraging somewhat crampedly, after going only a short way from camp,
in order to have a quick retreat.
Others were making a wide circuit to avoid the pickets and horsemen,
 and would flee any which way,
 either because they'd accepted defeat
 or because they'd seen cavalry on the march at a distance.

In the end many of them, contrary to custom, decided to leave off foraging
in the day and switched to doing it in the night.
