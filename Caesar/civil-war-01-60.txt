Interim Oscenses et Calagurritani, qui erant Oscensibus contributi,
mittunt ad eum legatos seseque imperata facturos pollicentur.  Hos
Tarraconenses et Iacetani et Ausetani et paucis post diebus
Illurgavonenses, qui flumen Hiberum attingunt, insequuntur.  Petit ab
his omnibus, ut se frumento iuvent.  Pollicentur atque omnibus undique
conquisitis iumentis in castra deportant.  Transit etiam cohors
Illurgavonensis ad eum cognito civitatis consilio et signa ex statione
transfert.  Magna celeriter commutatio rerum.  Perfecto ponte, magnis
quinque civitatibus ad amicitiam adiunctis, expedita re frumentaria,
exstinctis rumoribus de auxiliis legionum, quae cum Pompeio per
Mauritaniam venire dicebantur, multae longinquiores civitates ab Afranio
desciscunt et Caesaris amicitiam sequuntur.


Meanwhile the Oscenses and the Calagurriti (who had been attached to the
Oscenses) send him envoys and pledge to obey his orders.  The
Tarraconenses, the Iacetani, the Ausetani and, a few days later, the
Illurgavonenses, who live along the river Hiberum, follow them.  He asks
for assistance with the grain supply from all of them.  They promise to
help, and bring everything that they gathered from all sides into the
camp on mules.  A cohort of Illurgavonenses also crosses over to him,
after learning of the resolution of their town, and transfers their
battle standard from its station.  This great reversal of affairs
happened quickly.  With the bridge completed, with five large towns
added to the alliance, with his supply lines secured, having squelched
the rumors about the auxiliaries, which were said to be crossing with
Pompey by way of Mauritania, many distant towns defected from Afranius
and pursued alliances with Caesar.
