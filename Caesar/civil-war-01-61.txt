Quibus rebus perterritis animis adversariorum Caesar, ne
semper magno circuitu per pontem equitatus esset mittendus,
nactus idoneum locum fossas pedum XXX in latitudinem complures
facere instituit, quibus partem aliquam Sicoris averteret
vadumque in eo flumine efficeret.  His paene effectis magnum
in timorem Afranius Petreiusque perveniunt, ne omnino frumento
pabuloque intercluderentur, quod multum Caesar equitatu
valebat.  Itaque constituunt illis locis excedere et in
Celtiberiam bellum transferre.  Huic consilio suffragabatur
etiam illa res, quod ex duobus contrariis generibus, quae
superiore bello cum Sertorio steterant civitates, victae nomen
atque imperium absentis Pompei timebant, quae in amicitia
manserant, magnis affectae beneficiis eum diligebant; Caesaris
autem erat in barbaris nomen obscurius.  Hic magnos equitatus
magnaque auxilia exspectabant et suis locis bellum in hiemem
ducere cogitabant.  Hoc inito consilio toto flumine Hibero
naves conquiri et Octogesam adduci iubent.  Id erat oppidum
positum ad Hiberum miliaque passuum a castris aberat XXX.  Ad
eum locum fluminis navibus iunctis pontem imperant fieri
legionesque duas flumen Sicorim traducunt, castraque muniunt
vallo pedum XII.


His adversaries were disheartened by these events since, with
the bridge, Caesar need not send his cavalry riding on a wide
circuit.  After finding a suitable spot, he undertook to dig
30-foot deep trenches, with which he could divert a large part
of the river Sicoris and effect a ford in it.  When these
things were nearly finished, Afranius and Petreius fell into a
great fear that they might be cut off from all provisions and
fodder, because Caesar's cavalry was commanding.  And so they
decided to withdraw from those localities and to carry the war
into Celtiberia.  This resolve was supported by this
intelligence, that of the two differing factions, in the one
where the citizens had stood with Sertorius in the previous
war and been vanquished, they feared the name and the command
of the absent Pompey, and in the one where they had remained
in his good graces, they esteemed him for his great favors;
but Caesar's name was little known among these foreigners.
They waited for cavalry and a large auxiliary force here and
due to their positions they intended to conduct the war into
winter.  After they came to this conclusion they commanded
that ships be gathered along the length of the Hiberus River
and taken to Octogesa.  This was a town located on the Hiberus
and 30 miles from the camp.  They ordered a bridge to be made
of joined ships at this point on the river and transferred two
legions across the river Sicorim and fortified the camp with a
wall of 12 feet.
