Qua re per exploratores cognita summo labore militum Caesar
continuato diem noctemque opere in flumine avertendo huc iam rem
deduxerat, ut equites, etsi difficulter atque aegre fiebat, possent
tamen atque auderent flumen transire, pedites vero tantummodo umeris
ac summo pectore exstarent et cum altitudine aquae tum etiam
rapiditate fluminis ad transeundum impedirentur.  Sed tamen eodem
fere tempore pons in Hibero prope effectus nuntiabatur, et in Sicori
vadum reperiebatur.

By the time the scouts learned of this business Caesar had, through
the utmost exertion of his soldiers, working continuously, day and
night, already succeeded in diverting the river to the point of
drawing it down, so that the cavalry, albeit only with difficulty,
were nevertheless able to venture to cross the river, Indeed, only
the heads and shoulders of the infantry were visible, and they were
hampered in crossing by the depth of the water, and moreover by the
swiftness of the current.  And yet at nearly the same time it was
reported that the bridge over the Ebro was nearing completion, and
that the ford on the Sicorus was procured.
