[63] Iam vero eo magis illi maturandum iter existimabant.  Itaque
duabus auxiliaribus cohortibus Ilerdae praesidio relictis omnibus
copiis Sicorim transeunt et cum duabus legionibus, quas
superioribus diebus traduxerant, castra coniungunt.
Relinquebatur Caesari nihil, nisi uti equitatu agmen
adversariorum male haberet et carperet.  Pons enim ipsius magnum
circuitum habebat, ut multo breviore itinere illi ad Hiberum
pervenire possent.  Equites ab eo missi flumen transeunt et, cum
de tertia vigilia Petreius atque Afranius castra movissent,
repente sese ad novissimum agmen ostendunt et magna multitudine
circumfusa morari atque iter impedire incipiunt.


Now indeed, from this the enemy judged it better to hasten their
march.  And so, leaving two of the auxiliary cohorts at Ilerda as
a garrison, they crossed the Sicoris with all their troops and
joined up with the two legions that they had sent across in
recent days.  Nothing was left to Caesar but to use his cavalry
to hold and seize a troop of the enemy badly.  For the bridge
made a long way around for him, so that they could reach the
Iberus by much shorter marches.  The horsemen that he had sent
crossed the river and, when Petreius and Afranius had broken camp
after the third watch, suddenly revealed themselves to rearmost
troop and, surrounding them with a great multitude, began to
delay them and to obstruct their way.
