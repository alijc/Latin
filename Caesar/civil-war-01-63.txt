Iam vero eo magis illi maturandum iter existimabant. 

Itaque duabus auxiliaribus cohortibus Ilerdae praesidio relictis omnibus copiis
 Sicorim transeunt et cum duabus legionibus,
 quas superioribus diebus traduxerant, castra coniungunt. 

Relinquebatur Caesari nihil,
 nisi uti equitatu agmen adversariorum male haberet et carperet. 

Pons enim ipsius magnum circuitum habebat,
 ut multo breviore itinere illi ad Hiberum pervenire possent. 

Equites ab eo missi flumen transeunt et,
 cum de tertia vigilia Petreius atque Afranius castra movissent,
 repente sese ad novissimum agmen ostendunt et magna multitudine circumfusa
 morari atque iter impedire incipiunt.


Indeed, they were already reckoning to be hastening the journey there.

And so, leaving two of the auxiliary cohorts from Ilerda to guard
the remaining supplies, they crossed the Sicoris and united their camps
with the two legions that they had brought across in recent days.

Nothing was left behind by Caesar,
except what he might have to use the cavalry to seize a troop of the enemy badly.

For the bridge had cut off a long way around,
so that they could reach Spain by much shorter marches.

The horsemen that he had sent crossed the river and,
when Petreius and Afranius had broken camp after the third watch,
suddenly revealed themselves to rearmost troop and,
surrounding them with a great multitude, began to delay them
and to obstruct their way.
