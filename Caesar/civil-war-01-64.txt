[64] 

Prima luce ex superioribus locis, quae Caesaris castris erant
coniuncta, cernebatur equitatus nostri proelio novissimos illorum
premi vehementer ac nonnumquam sustineri extremum agmen atque
interrumpi, alias inferri signa et universarum cohortium impetu
nostros propelli, dein rursus conversos insequi.  Totis vero castris
milites circulari et dolere hostem ex manibus dimitti, bellum non
necessario longius duci; centuriones tribunosque militum adire atque
obsecrare, ut per eos Caesar certior fieret, ne labori suo neu
periculo parceret; paratos esse sese, posse et audere ea transire
flumen, qua traductus esset equitatus.  Quorum studio et vocibus
excitatus Caesar, etsi timebat tantae magnitudini fluminis exercitum
obicere, conandum tamen atque experiendum iudicat.  Itaque infirmiores
milites ex omnibus centuriis deligi iubet, quorum aut animus aut vires
videbantur sustinere non posse.  Hos cum legione una praesidio castris
relinquit; reliquas legiones expeditas educit magnoque numero
iumentorum in flumine supra atque infra constituto traducit exercitum.
Pauci ex his militibus abrepti vi fluminis ab equitatu excipiuntur ac
sublevantur; interit tamen nemo.  Traducto incolumi exercitu copias
instruit triplicemque aciem ducere incipit.  Ac tantum fuit in
militibus studii, ut milium sex ad iter addito circuitu magnaque ad
vadum fluminis mora interposita eos, qui de tertia vigilia exissent,
ante horam diei VIIII consequerentur.


At first light it became apparent, from the high ground adjacent to
Caesar's camp, that the rear of the enemy was being vigorously pursued
by our skirmishing cavalry.  At times the outer column would be held
up and scattered, at times the standards of all their cohorts would
surge forward together, and our men would be driven back by the
attack, but then the men would turn back to pursue in their turn.
Truly, through the entire camp the soldiers gathered and lamented that
the enemy would be released out of their hands, with the war to be
waged longer than necessary.  They approached the centurions and
military tribunes and implored them to have Caeser be made more sure
through them, and spare neither their labor or safety; they themselves
were ready, able and prepared to cross the river in the same way that
the cavalry had.  Caesar was roused by their zeal and words, although
he feared to cast the army into of a river of such magnitude, he
nonetheless judged that he should endeavor it and put it to the test.
And so he ordered each company to pick out their weaker soldiers,
whose courage or strength seemed not up to snuff.  He left these men
in camp, along with one legion for a garrison.  He led out the
remaining legions, with no baggage, and with a great many horses in
the river above and below the ford he led the army across to the
rendevous.  A few of his soldiers were swept away by the force of the
river and were picked up and pulled out of the river by the cavalry;
so no one perished.  After the infantry had led safely across, he drew
up supplies and undertook to lead a three-pronged battle array.  And
such was the zeal among the soldiers, that with six miles with having
been added to the journey in the detour and with a great delay imposed
on them in fording the river, that before the ninth hour of daylight
they caught up with the enemy, who had marched out at the third watch.
