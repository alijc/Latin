Disputatur in consilio a Petreio atque Afranio et tempus profectionis
quaeritur. 
Plerique censebant, ut noctu iter facerent:
 posse prius ad angustias veniri, quam sentiretur. 
Alii, quod pridie noctu conclamatum esset in Caesaris castris,
 argumenti sumebant loco non posse clam exiri. 
Circumfundi noctu equitatum Caesaris atque omnia loca atque itinera obsidere;
 nocturnaque proelia esse vitanda,
 quod perterritus miles in civili dissensione timori magis quam religioni
 consulere consuerit. 
At lucem multum per se pudorem omnium oculis,
 multum etiam tribunorum militum et centurionum praesentiam afferre;
 quibus rebus coerceri milites et in officio contineri soleant. 
Quare omni ratione esse interdiu perrumpendum:
 etsi aliquo accepto detrimento,
 tamen summa exercitus salva locum,
 quem petant,
 capi 
Haec vincit in consilio sententia,
 et prima luce postridie constituunt proficisci.


Petreius and Afranius called a strategy session to discuss the situation 
and find the right time for setting out.

The majority proposed that they should march out during the night:
so that they could reach the passes before they were seen.

Others, because of the uproar that had gone on in Caesar's camp the night
before, assumed on the basis of that evidence that they wouldn't be able to
march out in secret. 

to be hard-pressed in the night >Caesar's cavalry
 and all places/posts and roads to blockade/besiege/occupy/remain;
and nighttime battles to be avoided,
because a frightened soldier in civil strife would be accustomed 
to have more regard for fear than for duty.

But in the light of day, to bring great shame on themselves in the eyes of all,
and to do so in the presence of many of the military tribunes and centurions;
to be held together by these things, the soldiers were more wont to hold to
their duty.

And so for each the plan was to break through in the daytime:
even if anyone having received defeat,
nonetheless the utmost safety of army >the place,
>him they might attack/ask, to be captured to be able.

This opinion prevailed in the debate,
 and they resolved to set out at first light on the next day.
