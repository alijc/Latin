Disputatur in consilio a Petreio atque Afranio et tempus profectionis
quaeritur. 

Plerique censebant, ut noctu iter facerent:
 posse prius ad angustias veniri, quam sentiretur. 

Alii, quod pridie noctu conclamatum esset in Caesaris castris,
 argumenti sumebant loco non posse clam exiri. 

Circumfundi noctu equitatum Caesaris atque omnia loca atque itinera obsidere;
 nocturnaque proelia esse vitanda,
 quod perterritus miles in civili dissensione timori magis quam religioni
 consulere consuerit. 

At lucem multum per se pudorem omnium oculis,
 multum etiam tribunorum militum et centurionum praesentiam afferre;
 quibus rebus coerceri milites et in officio contineri soleant. 

Quare omni ratione esse interdiu perrumpendum:
 etsi aliquo accepto detrimento,
 tamen summa exercitus salva locum,
 quem petant,
 capi posse. 

Haec vincit in consilio sententia,
 et prima luce postridie constituunt proficisci.


It was debated in a strategy session by Petreius and Afranius and the time for
departure was sought.

And the majority felt that they should march out in the night:
to reach the passes earlier than it was thought.

Others, that the day before by night would be shouted out in Caesar's camp,
of a trick they were taking up in the place not to be able to come forth in
secret. 

crowded around by night >Caesar's cavalry and all places/posts and roads to
blockade/besiege/occupy;
and a nighttime battle to be avoided,
because a frightened soldier in a civil war/conflict to fear more than to
religion is accustomed to look out for.

But >the light much through themselves >decency of all to/by eyes,
much still of the military tribunes and centurions >present time to bring to;
to/by which matters to be enclosed the soldiers and in the duty to be kept safe
they might be in the habit.

Therefore to/by each plan to be in the daytime for breaking through:
although by anyone/anywhere to/by taken defeat,
nonetheless the utmost unharmed army >the place,
>him they might attack, to be captured to be able.

This opinion succeeded in debate,
 and at first light on the next day they resolve to set out.
