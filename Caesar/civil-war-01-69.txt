Ac primo Afraniani milites visendi causa laeti ex castris procurrebant
 contumeliosisque vocibus prosequebantur nostros:
 necessarii victus inopia coactos fugere atque ad Ilerdam reverti. 

Erat enim iter a proposito diversum, contrariamque in partem iri videbatur. 

Duces vero eorum consilium suum laudibus efferebant,
 quod se castris tenuissent;
 multumque eorum opinionem adiuvabat,
 quod sine iumentis impedimentisque ad iter profectos videbant,
 ut non posse inopiam diutius sustinere confiderent. 

Sed, ubi paulatim retorqueri agmen ad dextram conspexerunt
 iamque primos superare regionem castrorum animum adverterunt,
 nemo erat adeo tardus aut fugiens laboris,
 quin statim castris exeundum atque occurrendum putaret. 

Conclamatur ad arma,
 atque omnes copiae paucis praesidio relictis cohortibus exeunt
 rectoque ad Hiberum itinere contendunt.


And Afranianius' rejoicing soldiers were pouring out of the camp to see
and with insulting expressions pursued our men:
who were compelled by their lack of vital provisions to flee and turn back to
Ilerda.

For the route was separated by a manner, and in a contrary part to be marched
they were seen.

Indeed their commanders > their own advice with approval were carrying out,
because/that they had held themselves at the camp;
and much encouraged their opinion,
because/that they saw the departees to the march without mules and baggage,
to trust that they could sustain this lack all day.

But, when they observed that the troop was gradually turning to the right
and that the first of them were already occupying the neighborhood of the camp
they changed their minds, 
no one was to such a degree slow or fleeing of the toil,
in fact, at once by the camp to emerge and to run to meet he might reckon.

The signal to arms was given,
and all the troops marched out, save a few cohorts left behind as a guard
and did a forced march straight to the Ebro.
