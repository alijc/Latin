Ac primo Afraniani milites visendi causa laeti ex castris
procurrebant contumeliosisque vocibus prosequebantur nostros:
necessarii victus inopia coactos fugere atque ad Ilerdam reverti.
Erat enim iter a proposito diversum, contrariamque in partem iri
videbatur.  Duces vero eorum consilium suum laudibus efferebant,
quod se castris tenuissent; multumque eorum opinionem adiuvabat,
quod sine iumentis impedimentisque ad iter profectos videbant, ut
non posse inopiam diutius sustinere confiderent.  Sed, ubi paulatim
retorqueri agmen ad dextram conspexerunt iamque primos superare
regionem castrorum animum adverterunt, nemo erat adeo tardus aut
fugiens laboris, quin statim castris exeundum atque occurrendum
putaret.  Conclamatur ad arma, atque omnes copiae paucis praesidio
relictis cohortibus exeunt rectoque ad Hiberum itinere contendunt.

And at first Afranianius' delighted soldiers poured out of their
camp to see this and threw insulting expressions after our men,
thinking that they were compelled by their lack of provisions to
flee and retreat to Ilerda.  For their course had been intentionally
shaped so that they seemed to be marching in the opposite direction.
In truth, their commanders heaped praise upon their plan of
remaining encamped; and it supported their expectation a great deal
to see our soldiers marching off with neither pack animals nor
baggage, believing that we couldn't go without provisions a single
day more.  But when they observed that the army was gradually
turning to the right and realized that our front line had already
gained the ground above their camp, no one was in anywise slow or
lazy in considering why they shouldn't decamp at once to engage with
them.  The call to arms was given, and all the troops, save a few
cohorts left behind as a guard, marched out and marched in quickstep
straight to the Ebro.
