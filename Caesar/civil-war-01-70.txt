[70] Erat in celeritate omne positum certamen, utri prius
angustias montesque occuparent; sed exercitum Caesaris viarum
difficultates tardabant, Afranii copias equitatus Caesaris
insequens morabatur.  Res tamen ab Afranianis huc erat
necessario deducta, ut, si priores montes, quos petebant,
attigissent, ipsi periculum vitarent, impedimenta totius
exercitus cohortesque in castris relictas servare non possent;
quibus interclusis exercitu Caesaris auxilium ferri nulla
ratione poterat.  Confecit prior iter Caesar atque ex magnis
rupibus nactus planitiem in hac contra hostem aciem instruit.
Afranius, cum ab equitatu novissimum agmen premeretur, ante se
hostem videret, collem quendam nactus ibi constitit.  Ex eo loco
IIII cetratorum cohortes in montem, qui erat in conspectu omnium
excelsissimus, mittit.  Hunc magno cursu concitatos iubet
occupare, eo consilio, uti ipse eodem omnibus copiis contenderet
et mutato itinere iugis Octogesam perveniret.  Hunc cum obliquo
itinere cetrati peterent, conspicatus equitatus Caesaris in
cohortes impetum fecit; nec minimam partem temporis equitum vim
cetrati sustinere potuerunt omnesque ab eis circumventi in
conspectu utriusque exercitus interficiuntur.

With all speed the struggle was staged, with each side trying to
be the first to capture the passes and mountains.  But the
hardships of the marches hindered Caesar's infantry, while
Caesar's pursuing cavalry delayed Afranius' troops.
Nevertheless Afranius was unavoidably led to this point, that
they could evade the danger by being the first to reach the
mountains that they were aiming for, but they couldn't protect
the cohorts and the whole of the army's baggage that had been
left in camp.  For after he was cut off by Caesar's army he
could on no account bring aid to them.  Caesar completed his
march first, getting out of the rough country and reaching the
plain, where he drew up his frontline facing the enemy.  When
Afranius, still being harried by the calvary, saw the enemy
ahead of him, seized a hill and made a stand there.  From there
he sent out 4 cohorts of skirmishers to the highest mountain in
sight.  He roused them and ordered them to capture this mountain
with all haste, with the plan that he would strive for the same
place with all his troops and would reach Octogesa by successive
marches.  When the skirmishers attacked this in an curving
march, but when Caesar's calvary caught sight of the cohorts it
charged into them; The skirmishers could not sustain the
cavalry's force for very long at all, and they were surrounded
and destroyed in the sight of both armies.
