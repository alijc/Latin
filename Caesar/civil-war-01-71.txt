71.1  

Erat occasio bene gerendae rei. 

Neque vero id Caesarem fugiebat,
 tanto sub oculis accepto detrimento perterritum exercitum sustinere non posse,
 praesertim circumdatum undique equitatu,
 cum in loco aequo atque aperto confligeretur; 
idque ex omnibus partibus ab eo flagitabatur. 

Concurrebant legati, centuriones tribunique militum:
 ne dubitaret proelium committere;
 omnium esse militum paratissimos animos. 

Afranianos contra multis rebus sui timoris signa misisse:
 quod suis non subvenissent,
 quod de colle non decederent,
 quod vix equitum incursus sustinerent
 collatisque in unum locum signis conferti neque ordines neque signa servarent. 

Quod si iniquitatem loci timeret,
 datum iri tamen aliquo loco pugnandi facultatem,
 quod certe inde decedendum esset Afranio nec sine aqua permanere posset.

There was a chance/opportunity for carrying the matter out well.

And truly, it was not avoiding Caesar,
so much under eyes the harm having been received that the frightened infantry
could not sustain, 
especially >surrounded on all sides by the calvary,
since they fought on even and open ground;
and it out of all regions by him was pressing.

The officers, centurions and military tribunes agreed:
lest he hesitated to commit to battle;
that all of the soldiers were prepared souls.

>Afranius' men against many things of their dread signals to have sent:
that they had no chance of rescue,
that from the hill not they might retire,
that hardly of the cavalry an attack they might sustain and 
by/to united signs/standards in one place having been crowded 
and not ranks and not standards might preserve.

But if >unevenness/unfairness of the place he might fear,
yet giving from some other place the opportunity for fighting  ,
that/because surely from that place >about to retire/withdraw by/to Afranius
and note without water he could flow through/endure.
