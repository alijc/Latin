71.1  
Erat occasio bene gerendae rei. 
Neque vero id Caesarem fugiebat,
 tanto sub oculis accepto detrimento perterritum exercitum sustinere non posse,
 praesertim circumdatum undique equitatu,
 cum in loco aequo atque aperto confligeretur; 
idque ex omnibus partibus ab eo flagitabatur. 
Concurrebant legati, centuriones tribunique militum:
 ne dubitaret proelium committere;
 omnium esse militum paratissimos animos. 
Afranianos contra multis rebus sui timoris signa misisse:
 quod suis non subvenissent,
 quod de colle non decederent,
 quod vix equitum incursus sustinerent
 collatisque in unum locum signis conferti neque ordines neque signa servarent. 
Quod si iniquitatem loci timeret,
 datum iri tamen aliquo loco pugnandi facultatem,
 quod certe inde decedendum esset Afranio nec sine aqua permanere posset.


There was a chance that it would work out well.
And there was no escaping Caesar,
after seeing with their own eyes how they'd suffered such a loss,
because the frightened infantry couldn't hold it together,
especially since they were surrounded on all sides by the calvary,
which, fighting on even and open ground,
was pressing on them from every side.
The officers, centurions and military tribunes met:
fearing that he hesitated to commit to battle;
telling him that all of the soldiers were ready and waiting.
And that Afranius' men, faced with so many difficulties, 
had shown signs of fear,
that they had no chance of rescue,
that they couldn't retreat from the hill,
that they could hardly sustain a cavalry assault and
with their standards collected together in one place,
they wouldn't be able to preserve either their ranks or their standards.
But if he feared the unevenness of the place,
yet giving the chance of fighting in some other place,
that surely Afranius could not last without water and
needed to retreat from there.
