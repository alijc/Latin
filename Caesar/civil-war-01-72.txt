72.1

Caesar in eam spem venerat, se sine pugna et sine vulnere suorum
rem conficere posse, quod re frumentaria adversarios
interclusisset.  Cur etiam secundo proelio aliquos ex suis
amitteret?  cur vulnerari pateretur optime de se meritos milites?
cur denique fortunam periclitaretur?  praesertim cum non minus
esset imperatoris consilio superare quam gladio.  Movebatur etiam
misericordia civium, quos interficiendos videbat; quibus salvis
atque incolumibus rem obtinere malebat.  Hoc consilium Caesaris
plerisque non probabatur: milites vero palam inter se loquebantur,
quoniam talis occasio victoriae dimitteretur, etiam cum vellet
Caesar, sese non esse pugnaturos.  Ille in sua sententia
perseverat et paulum ex eo loco digreditur, ut timorem adversariis
minuat.  Petreius atque Afranius oblata facultate in castra sese
referunt.  Caesar praesidiis montibus dispositis omni ad Hiberum
intercluso itinere quam proxime potest hostium castris castra
communit.


Caesar had fallen into the hope that he could bring this affair to
a close without a fight and with no harm to his men, seeing that
he had cut his enemy off from their grain supply.  Why should he
risk losing any of his men in another battle?  Why should he allow
some of his well-deserving solders to be wounded?  And finally,
why should he tempt fortune?  Especially since it was better for a
general to win with a plan than with a sword.  And he was also
moved with compassion for the citizens that he considered were
about to be killed; he preferred to obtain his result with them
safe and sound.  This plan of Caesar's wasn't approved by the
majority: indeed, the soldiers spoke openly among themselves,
since such an opportunity for victory was being squandered, but
Caesar still desired that they would not go into battle.  He
persisted in his opinion and withdrew a bit from the spot, so as
to lessen his adversaries' fear.  Petreius and Afranius took the
chance that was offered to them and returned to their camp.
Caesar posted a garrison in the mountains, which cut off the march
to the Ebro, and invested the enemy's camp as closely as he could.
