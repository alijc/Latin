73.1 Postero die duces adversariorum perturbati, quod omnem rei
frumentariae fluminisque Hiberi spem dimiserant, de reliquis rebus
consultabant.  Erat unum iter, Ilerdam si reverti vellent; alterum, si
Tarraconem peterent.  Haec consiliantibus eis nuntiantur aquatores ab
equitatu premi nostro.  Qua re cognita crebras stationes disponunt
equitum et cohortium alariarum legionariasque intericiunt cohortes
vallumque ex castris ad aquam ducere incipiunt, ut intra munitionem et
sine timore et sine stationibus aquari possent.  Id opus inter se
Petreius atque Afranius partiuntur ipsique perficiundi operis causa
longius progrediuntur.


On the next day the enemy commanders, distressed at having giving up all
hope of resupply and of reaching the Ebro, were discussing their
remaining options.  There was one route if they wished to turn back to
Ilerda; another if they aimed for Tarraco.  As they were deliberating,
they were told that their water-carriers were being hard pressed by our
cavalry.  After they learned this they posted close-set guards of horse
and the auxiliary cohorts, inserting the legionary cohorts between them,
and so constructed a line of defense from the camp down to the water, so
that they could fetch water within this defense without either fear or
guards.  Petreius and Afranius divided this work up between them and
went out themselves in order to get the work done.
