73.1 

Postero die duces adversariorum perturbati,
 quod omnem rei frumentariae fluminisque Hiberi spem dimiserant,
 de reliquis rebus consultabant. 

Erat unum iter, Ilerdam si reverti vellent;
 alterum, si Tarraconem peterent. 

Haec consiliantibus eis nuntiantur aquatores ab equitatu premi nostro. 

Qua re cognita crebras stationes disponunt equitum
 et cohortium alariarum legionariasque intericiunt cohortes
 vallumque ex castris ad aquam ducere incipiunt,
 ut intra munitionem et sine timore et sine stationibus aquari possent. 

Id opus inter se Petreius atque Afranius partiuntur
 ipsique perficiundi operis causa longius progrediuntur.


On the following day the enemy commanders, troubled,
because all hope of the grain supply and the Ebro river they had given up,
were discussing the remaining matters.

There was one march, if they wished to turn back to Ilerda;
another, if they aimed for Tarracone.

These things, after they deliberated, were announced 
the water-carriers by our cavalry to be pressed hard.

which thing having become known they posted close-set pickets of horse
and of cohorts of the auxiliary cavalry and interposed legionary cohorts
and wall/of the valleys out of the camp to the water undertook to lead,
so that between/among the fortification without fear and 
without watches they could fetch water.
