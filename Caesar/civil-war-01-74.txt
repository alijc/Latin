74.1 

Quorum discessu liberam nacti milites colloquiorum facultatem vulgo procedunt,
et quem quisque in castris notum aut municipem habebat conquirit atque evocat. 
Primum agunt gratias omnibus, quod sibi perterritis pridie pepercissent:
 eorum se beneficio vivere. 
Deinde de imperatoris fide quaerunt,
 rectene se illi sint commissuri,
 et quod non ab initio fecerint armaque
 cum hominibus necessariis et consanguineis contulerint, queruntur. 
His provocati sermonibus fidem ab imperatore de Petreii atque Afranii vita
 petunt,
 ne quod in se scelus concepisse neu suos prodidisse videantur. 
Quibus confirmatis rebus se statim signa translaturos confirmant 
legatosque de pace primorum ordinum centuriones ad Caesarem mittunt. 
Interim alii suos in castra invitandi causa adducunt,
 alii ab suis abducuntur,
 adeo ut una castra iam facta ex binis viderentur; 
compluresque tribuni militum et centuriones ad Caesarem veniunt
 seque ei commendant. 
Idem hoc fit a principibus Hispaniae,
 quos evocaverant et secum in castris habebant obsidum loco. 
Hi suos notos hospitesque quaerebant,
 per quem quisque eorum aditum commendationis haberet ad Caesarem. 
Afranii etiam filius adulescens de sua ac parentis sui salute
 cum Caesare per Sulpicium legatum agebat. 
Erant plena laetitia et gratulatione omnia,
 eorum, qui tanta pericula vitasse,
 et eorum, qui sine vulnere tantas res confecisse videbantur,
 magnumque fructum suae pristinae lenitatis omnium iudicio Caesar ferebat,
 consiliumque eius a cunctis probabatur.


Of which conversations the soldiers, having obtained an unfettered oportunity
for dispersing, go forward in common, 
and as everyone had a friend or neighbor in the (other?) camp,
he sought him out and called to him.
First of all they gave thanks that they'd been spared, 
despite having been very frightened the day before:
that they lived on account of (Caesar's?) kindness.
Then they sought the general's trust, lamenting 
that they shouldn't forfeit their lives,
and that they might not do from the start
after men bound by friendship and kin collected their arms.
These, called out by the speeches, asked the general for good faith
concernig the lives of Petrius and Afranius,
lest they seem to hold wickedness in themselves
or to reveal their own (men?).
When these things have been confirmed, 
they immediately declare that they will carry the standards across
and send envoys of peace form the chief ranks of the centurions to Caesar.
In the meantime some lead their men into the camp should for the sake of
summoning, others lead their men out of theirs,
to such a degree it seems that a single camp has been made of two separate ones;
and many of the military tribunes and centurions come to Caesar
and entrust their lives to him.
The same thing is done by the Spanish leaders,
whom they had summoned and were holding hostage with them in the camp.
They were looking for their own friends and fellows,
through whom each of them might have a chance of being commended to Caesar.
Even Afranius' youthful son acted on his own safety and his father's
with Caesar through the envoy Sulpicius.
They were filled with joy and all rejoicing,
of those who had avoided such great danger,
and of those who seemed to have carried off such things without injury,
and in the opinion of all Caesar bore the great profits by his former lenience, 
and his plan was approved by all.
