75.1 Quibus rebus nuntiatis Afranius ab instituto opere discedit
seque in castra recipit, sic paratus, ut videbatur, ut,
quicumque accidisset casus, hunc quieto et aequo animo ferret.
Petreius vero non deserit sese.  Armat familiam; cum hac et
praetoria cohorte cetratorum barbarisque equitibus paucis,
beneficiariis suis, quos suae custodiae causa habere consuerat,
improviso ad vallum advolat, colloquia militum interrumpit,
nostros repellit a castris, quos deprendit interficit.  Reliqui
coeunt inter se et repentino periculo exterriti sinistras sagis
involvunt gladiosque destringunt atque ita se a cetratis
equitibusque defendunt castrorum propinquitate confisi seque in
castra recipiunt et ab eis cohortibus, quae erant in statione ad
portas, defenduntur.


When these events were reported to Afranius, he left off the
work that he'd been arranging and betook himself back to camp,
thus ready, as it seemed, to bear whatever fortune might befall
him with a quiet and level head.  Petreius, however, didn't
forget himself.  He armed his household and with them and with
his personal bodyguard, made up of shield-carrying soldiers and
a few foreign horsemen, he makes an sudden dash to the rampart,
breaks up the soldiers' parleys, and drives our men out of the
camp, killing the ones that he catches.  The rest of our men
gather themselves together and, frightened by this unexpected
danger, wrap their cloaks round their left hands and draw their
swords, and so defend themselves from Petreius' bodyguard.
Relying on the nearness of their own camp they betook themselves
back to it and were protected by the cohorts who were stationed
at the gates.
