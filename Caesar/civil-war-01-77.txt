77.1 Caesar, qui milites adversariorum in castra per tempus colloquii
venerant, summa diligentia conquiri et remitti iubet.  Sed ex numero
tribunorum militum centurionumque nonnulli sua voluntate apud eum
remanserunt.  Quos ille postea magno in honore habuit; centuriones in
priores ordines, equites Romanos in tribunicium restituit honorem.


Caesar commanded that those enemy soldiers who had come into camp
while the parleys were going on should be sought out with the greatest
care and sent back.  But a few of the military tribunes and centurions
stayed behind with him of their own accord.  He afterwards held these
in great honor; he restored the centurions to the first ranks and the
Roman cavalrymen to the honor of tribunes.
