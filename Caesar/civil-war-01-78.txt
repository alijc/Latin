78.1 Premebantur Afraniani pabulatione, aquabantur aegre.
Frumenti copiam legionarii nonnullam habebant, quod dierum
XXII ab Ilerda frumentum iussi erant efferre, cetrati
auxiliaresque nullam, quorum erant et facultates ad
parandum exiguae et corpora insueta ad onera portanda.
Itaque magnus eorum cotidie numerus ad Caesarem
perfugiebat.  In his erat angustiis res.  Sed ex propositis
consiliis duobus explicitius videbatur Ilerdam reverti,
quod ibi paulum frumenti reliquerant.  Ibi se reliquum
consilium explicaturos confidebant.  Tarraco aberat
longius; quo spatio plures rem posse casus recipere
intellegebant.  Hoc probato consilio ex castris
proficiscuntur.  Caesar equitatu praemisso, qui novissimum
agmen carperet atque impediret, ipse cum legionibus
subsequitur.  Nullum intercedebat tempus, quin extremi cum
equitibus proeliarentur.

Afranianius' men were hard pressed their foraging, and it
was hard for them to get water.  The legions had a small
supply of provisions because they'd been ordered to carry
22 days worth of grain out of Ilerda, but there were none
for the light soldiers and auxiliaries, who had both little
means of getting any and bodies unused to carrying burdens.
And so every day a great number of them deserted to Caesar.
It was a hard thing for these men.  But of the two plans
that were proposed it seemed more straightforward to return
to Ilerda, because a bit of provisions was still there.
They were sure that they'd be able to come up with a
subsequent plan there.  Tarraco (Catalonia) was pretty far
away; and they realized that they could encounter more
misfortunes in that distance.  After approving this plan,
they broke camp.  Caesar sent the cavalry ahead to harry
and hamper the rearmost column and he himself followed with
the legions. Not a minute passed, but that the rearguard
was engaged in battle with the cavalry.
