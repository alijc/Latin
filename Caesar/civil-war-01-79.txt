[79] 
Genus erat hoc pugnae. 
Expeditae cohortes novissimum agmen claudebant
pluresque in locis campestribus subsistebant. 
Si mons erat ascendendus,
facile ipsa loci natura periculum repellebat, 
quod ex locis superioribus,
qui antecesserant, suos ascendentes protegebant;
cum vallis aut locus declivis suberat, 
neque ei, qui antecesserant,
morantibus opem ferre poterant, 
equites vero ex loco superiore in aversos tela coniciebant, 
tum magno erat in periculo res.
Relinquebatur, ut,
cum eiusmodi locis esset appropinquatum, 
legionum signa consistere iuberent magnoque impetu equitatum repellerent,
eo submoto repente incitati cursu sese in valles universi demitterent
atque ita transgressi rursus in locis superioribus consisterent.
Nam tantum ab equitum suorum auxiliis aberant,
quorum numerum habebant magnum,
ut eos superioribus perterritos proeliis in medium reciperent
agmen ultroque eos tuerentur;
quorum nulli ex itinere excedere licebat, 
quin ab equitatu Caesaris exciperetur.

This was the sort of battle it was.
The lightly-armed cohorts brought up the rear
and many of them made their stands on level ground.
Where the ground was rising, the very nature of the place repelled
danger, because those who had gotten there first could protect their
compatriots as they made the climb;
when in a valley or on ground sloping downward,
and with those in the vanguard unable to offer assistance,
in fact the cavalry turned the enemy aside by casting spears from the
higher ground, (but also/then) the business was in great peril.
It was left so that when they approached places like this,
they'd command the standards of the legions to stand together
and drive them back with a great cavalry assault,
and after dislodging it/him/them they all thrust themselves down into the
valleys at a gallup and made a stand after crossing back onto higher
ground.
For so much by our cavalry was absent from the auxillaries,
of whom they had a great number,
so that they recovered the men frightened by the earlier battles
in the middle
they preserved the column and beyond them;
of whom no one was allowed to leave off marching,
who would not withdraw from Caesar's cavalry.
