Tali dum pugnatur modo, lente atque paulatim proceditur,
crebroque, ut sint auxilio suis, 
subsistunt; ut tum accidit. 

Milia enim progressi IIII vehementiusque peragitati ab equitatu montem
excelsum capiunt ibique una fronte contra hostem castra muniunt neque
iumentis onera deponunt. 

Ubi Caesaris castra posita tabernaculaque
constituta et dimissos equites pabulandi causa animum adverterunt,
sese subito proripiunt hora circiter sexta eiusdem diei et spem nacti
morae discessu nostrorum equitum iter facere incipiunt. 

Qua re animum adversa Caesar refectis legionibus subsequitur, 
 praesidio impedimentis paucas cohortes relinquit; 
hora x subsequi pabulatores equitesque revocari iubet. 

Celeriter equitatus ad cotidianum itineris officium revertitur. 

Pugnatur acriter ad novissimum agmen, adeo ut paene terga
convertant, compluresque milites, etiam nonnulli centuriones,
interficiuntur. 

Instabat agmen Caesaris atque universum imminebat.


While by/to such way it is fought, slowly and gradually it is advanced,
and frequently/often/repeatedly, so that they were to/by their aid,
they make a stand/halt; as it then happened.

For a thousand having advanced 4 and more vigorously harrassed by the
cavalry captured the tall mountain and there by a single front against
the enemy fortified the camp and not lifted off loads from the mules.

Where(by) Caesar, camp pitched and tents set up and cavalry sent out
in order to forage they turned their mind,
selves suddenly they rushed out/dragged away at about the sixth hour
of the same day and having taken hope of a delay to march off of our cavalry
to make their road they begin.

which matter having turned heart/soul/mind, Caesar pursued with
restored legions, to/by guard to/by baggage >few cohorts left behind;
at the 10th hour to follow foragers and cavalry to be recalled he
orders.

quickly the cavalry to daily/usual march returned the duty.

it is fought to the rearmost column to such a degree that they nearly
turn back, and many soldiers, and even a few centurions, were killed.

it was pursuing Caesar's column and >the whole it threatened.
