[79] 

Genus erat hoc pugnae. 

Expeditae cohortes novissimum agmen claudebant
pluresque in locis campestribus subsistebant. 

Si mons erat ascendendus,
facile ipsa loci natura periculum repellebat, 
quod ex locis superioribus,
qui antecesserant, suos ascendentes protegebant;
cum vallis aut locus declivis suberat, 
neque ei, qui antecesserant,
morantibus opem ferre poterant, 
equites vero ex loco superiore in aversos tela coniciebant, 
tum magno erat in periculo res.

Relinquebatur, ut,
cum eiusmodi locis esset appropinquatum, 
legionum signa consistere iuberent magnoque impetu equitatum repellerent,
eo submoto repente incitati cursu sese in valles universi demitterent
atque ita transgressi rursus in locis superioribus consisterent.

Nam tantum ab equitum suorum auxiliis aberant,
quorum numerum habebant magnum,
ut eos superioribus perterritos proeliis in medium reciperent
agmen ultroque eos tuerentur;
quorum nulli ex itinere excedere licebat, 
quin ab equitatu Caesaris exciperetur.


The sort was this of the battle.

The lightly-armed/unbaggaged cohorts >the rearmost column were besieging
and many in places level were halting.

if mountion was for climbing,
easily the very nature of the place repelled danger,
that/because from the higher ground,
those who had gone ahead, protected their own climbing;
as/when/with valley or place sloping was underneath,
and not to them who had gone ahead,
to/by delaying >power weapons could,
cavalry indeed out of place higher into their rear cast spears,
then to/by great was in danger the matter.

it was left behind, so that,
since of this sort to/by places were approached,
of the legions the standards to stand together they would command
and to/by great assault of the cavalry they might drive them back,
having dislodged him/it suddenly at a gallop selves into valleys they
all plunged and so having crossed back in the higher ground they made
a stand.

For so much by our cavalry to/by the auxillaries they were absent,
of whom they had a great number,
so that >them to/by higher battles >frightened men in the middle they
recovered the column and beyond them they saw/protected;
of whom none from the march to pass it was permitted,
so that not from Caesar's cavalry was it warded off.
