[79] Genus erat hoc pugnae.  Expeditae cohortes novissimum agmen
claudebant pluresque in locis campestribus subsistebant.  Si mons
erat ascendendus, facile ipsa loci natura periculum repellebat, quod
ex locis superioribus, qui antecesserant, suos ascendentes
protegebant; cum vallis aut locus declivis suberat, neque ei, qui
antecesserant, morantibus opem ferre poterant, equites vero ex loco
superiore in aversos tela coniciebant, tum magno erat in periculo
res. Relinquebatur, ut, cum eiusmodi locis esset appropinquatum,
legionum signa consistere iuberent magnoque impetu equitatum
repellerent, eo submoto repente incitati cursu sese in valles
universi demitterent atque ita transgressi rursus in locis
superioribus consisterent. Nam tantum ab equitum suorum auxiliis
aberant, quorum numerum habebant magnum, ut eos superioribus
perterritos proeliis in medium reciperent agmen ultroque eos
tuerentur; quorum nulli ex itinere excedere licebat, quin ab
equitatu Caesaris exciperetur.

This was the sort of battle it was. The lightly-armed cohorts brought
up the rear and frequently stopped to fight on level ground. Where the
ground was rising, the very nature of the place mitigated the danger,
because those who had gotten there first could protect their
compatriots as they made the climb. But when in a valley or on ground
sloping downward, those in the vanguard were unable to offer
assistance. In fact, our cavalry, from the higher ground, cast their
spears at them and put them to flight. At that point the business was
one of great peril. It followed that when they got close to places
like this, they'd command the legions to make a stand and drive the
cavalry back with a great assault. And after dislodging it they'd all
race down into the valley and halt again after crossing back onto
higher ground. For so much of their cavalry, of whom they had a large
number, had deserted, frightened by the earlier battles, that they
pulled them into the middle of the column, considering them past use.
None of them were permitted to withdraw from the march, or else they'd
be captured by Caesar's cavalry.
