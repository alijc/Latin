Tali dum pugnatur modo, lente atque paulatim proceditur,
crebroque, ut sint auxilio suis, 
subsistunt; ut tum accidit. 

Milia enim progressi IIII vehementiusque peragitati ab equitatu montem
excelsum capiunt ibique una fronte contra hostem castra muniunt neque
iumentis onera deponunt. 

Ubi Caesaris castra posita tabernaculaque
constituta et dimissos equites pabulandi causa animum adverterunt,
sese subito proripiunt hora circiter sexta eiusdem diei et spem nacti
morae discessu nostrorum equitum iter facere incipiunt. 

Qua re animum adversa Caesar refectis legionibus subsequitur, 
 praesidio impedimentis paucas cohortes relinquit; 
hora x subsequi pabulatores equitesque revocari iubet. 

Celeriter equitatus ad cotidianum itineris officium revertitur. 

Pugnatur acriter ad novissimum agmen, adeo ut paene terga
convertant, compluresque milites, etiam nonnulli centuriones,
interficiuntur. 

Instabat agmen Caesaris atque universum imminebat.


While the battle goes on in this way, the army advances slowly and surely,
and they repeatedly make a stand, in order to aid their own men as they fell.

For after advancing 4 miles and being more vigorously harrassed by our
cavalry, they seized a commanding height and there erected a fortified camp
with a single front against the enemy, without even unpacking their mules.

Where Caesar's men, when the camp was pitched and tents set up and cavalry had
been sent out to forage, turned their attention,
suddenly rushed out at about the sixth hour of the same day
and seizing the hope of a delay for our cavalry's decamping
they begin to make their journey.

When Caesar noticed this, he pursued with his refitted legions,
leaving a few cohorts behind to guard the baggage;
at the 10th hour he commanded that the foragers and cavalry be recalled to join
the pursuit.

The cavalry quickly returned to their usual marching orders.

The battle raged to the rearmost column so fiercely that they nearly
turned tail and ran, and many soldiers, and even a few centurions, were killed.

Caesar's army was approaching and threatening the entire marching column.
