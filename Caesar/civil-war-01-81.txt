81.1 Tum vero neque ad explorandum idoneum locum castris
neque ad progrediendum data facultate consistunt necessario
et procul ab aqua et natura iniquo loco castra ponunt.  Sed
isdem de causis Caesar, quae supra sunt demonstratae,
proelio non lacessit et eo die tabernacula statui passus non
est, quo paratiores essent ad insequendum omnes, sive noctu
sive interdiu erumperent.  Illi animadverso vitio castrorum
tota nocte munitiones proferunt castraque castris
convertunt.  Hoc idem postero die a prima luce faciunt
totumque in ea re diem consumunt.  Sed quantum opere
processerant et castra protulerant, tanto aberant ab aqua
longius, et praesenti malo aliis malis remedia dabantur.
Prima nocte aquandi causa nemo egreditur ex castris; proximo
die praesidio in castris relicto universas ad aquam copias
educunt, pabulatum emittitur nemo.  His eos suppliciis male
haberi Caesar et necessariam subire deditionem quam proelio
decertare malebat.  Conatur tamen eos vallo fossaque
circummunire, ut quam maxime repentinas eorum eruptiones
demoretur; quo necessario descensuros existimabat.  Illi et
inopia pabuli adducti et, quo essent expeditiores, omnia
sarcinaria iumenta interfici iubent.


In fact, they halted of necessity then, without the
opportunity for either scouting out a suitable site for a
camp or for advancing, and set up camp far from water and on
uneven ground.  But Caesar, for the same reasons that were
shown above, didn't provoke a battle, and he didn't allow
the tents to pitched that day, so that the men would be all
the more ready to attack, whether the enemy sallied forth by
night or by day.  Those enemy, taking note of the defects of
their camp, spent all night fortifying it, and changed their
camp with a camp.  The next day they did the same thing,
starting at first light, and they used the whole day up in
this matter.  But by however much they moved forward with
the work and extended the camp, they were that much farther
away from water, and from the present evil they were given a
remedy for others.  The first night no one went out of camp
to fetch water; on the next day, leaving a guard in camp,
they took all the troops to water, and no one was allowed
out to forage.  Caesar held off, leaving them to these
pitiful sufferings and preferred to enter into their
inevitable surrender than to fight a battle.  Nevertheless
he undertook to surround them with a pallisade and trench,
to hold back as much as possible their unexpected sallies;
which he thought necessary for the coming march down.  They,
both led by their lack of provisions and that they might be
free to be on the march, ordered all their pack animals to
be killed.
