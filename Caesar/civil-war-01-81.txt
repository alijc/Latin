81.1 
Tum vero neque ad explorandum idoneum locum castris
 neque ad progrediendum data facultate consistunt necessario
 et procul ab aqua
 et natura iniquo loco castra ponunt. 
Sed isdem de causis Caesar,
 quae supra sunt demonstratae,
 proelio non lacessit et eo die tabernacula statui passus non est,
 quo paratiores essent ad insequendum omnes,
 sive noctu sive interdiu erumperent. 
Illi animadverso vitio castrorum tota nocte munitiones proferunt
 castraque castris convertunt. 
Hoc idem postero die a prima luce faciunt
 totumque in ea re diem consumunt. 
Sed quantum opere processerant et castra protulerant, 
 tanto aberant ab aqua longius,
 et praesenti malo aliis malis remedia dabantur. 
Prima nocte aquandi causa nemo egreditur ex castris;
 proximo die praesidio in castris relicto universas ad aquam copias educunt,
 pabulatum emittitur nemo. 




In fact, they halted of necessity then, without the opportunity for either 
scouting out a suitable site for a camp or for advancing, and set up camp
far from water and on uneven ground.
But Caesar, from the same reasons that were shown above, 
didn't provoke a battle,
and he didn't allow the tents to pitched that day,
so that everyone would be extra ready for attacking, 
whether the enemy sallied forth by night or by day.
Those men, taking note of the defects of the camp, spent all night fortifying
it, and turned the camp into a camp.
The next day they do the same thing, starting at first light,
and they use the whole day up in this matter.
But by however much they moved forward with the work and extended the camp,
they were that much farther away from water,
and in the present evil they were given a remedy for other evils.
The first night no one went out of camp to fetch water;
on the next day the guard that had been left in camp led all the troops to
water, while no one was allowed out to forage.


His eos suppliciis male haberi Caesar
 et necessariam subire deditionem quam proelio decertare malebat. 

to/by these sufferings Caesar was held poorly
and >needed to come up with aid surrender than the guard preferred to fight.

Conatur tamen eos vallo fossaque circummunire,
 ut quam maxime repentinas eorum eruptiones demoretur;
 quo necessario descensuros existimabat. 

Nevertheless he undertook to have them fortify with a pallisade and trench,
to hold back as much as possible their unexpected sallies;
which he thought necessary for those about to march down.

Illi et inopia pabuli adducti et,
 quo essent expeditiores,
 omnia sarcinaria iumenta interfici iubent.

They, both led by their lack of provisions and,
to the road by which the scouts might be,
ordered all their pack animals to be killed.
