82.1 In his operibus consiliisque biduum consumitur; tertio die magna
iam pars operis Caesaris processerat.  Illi impediendae reliquae
munitionis causa hora circiter VIIII signo dato legiones educunt
aciemque sub castris instruunt.  Caesar ab opere legiones revocat,
equitatum omnem convenire iubet, aciem instruit; contra opinionem
enim militum famamque omnium videri proelium defugisse magnum
detrimentum afferebat.  Sed eisdem de causis, quae sunt cognitae, quo
minus dimicare vellet, movebatur, atque hoc etiam magis, quod spatii
brevitate etiam in fugam coniectis adversariis non multum ad summam
victoria iuvare poterat.  Non enim amplius pedum milibus duobus ab
castris castra distabant; hinc duas partes acies occupabant duae;
tertia vacabat ad incursum atque impetum militum relicta.  Si
proelium committeretur, propinquitas castrorum celerem superatis ex
fuga receptum dabat.  Hac de causa constituerat signa inferentibus
resistere, prior proelio non lacessere.

Two days were taken in these labors and plans; by the third day a
great part of Caesar's work had already been done.  In order to
prevent the completion of the fortifications, the enemy called their
men to arms, drew up their legions and formed a line of battle before
their camp.  Caesar recalled his legions from their labor, ordered
all the horse to assemble and drew up a line of battle; for to be
seen to avoid a battle, contrary to all the soldiers' expectation and his 
own reputation, would bring him great damage.  But for the same reasons
that have already been understood, he was troubled, and determined
not to attack, even more so because, even if his adverseries were
quickly thrown into flight, he couldn't well delight in a complete
victory.  For the camps were not more than two miles apart;
two lines of battle occupied two parts of this space; the third was open to
attack and assault and empty of soldiers.  If a battle was joined,
the nearness of their camp would offer a quick retreat to those
overwhelmed.  For this reason he had resolved to stay his own attack,
and not to be the first to provoke a battle.
