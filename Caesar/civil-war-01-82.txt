In his operibus consiliisque biduum consumitur; 
tertio die magna iam pars operis Caesaris processerat. 
Illi impediendae reliquae munitionis causa hora circiter VIIII signo dato
legiones educunt aciemque sub castris instruunt. 

Caesar ab opere legiones revocat,
 equitatum omnem convenire iubet,
 aciem instruit; 
contra opinionem enim militum famamque omnium videri proelium defugisse magnum
 detrimentum afferebat. 

Sed eisdem de causis,
 quae sunt cognitae,
 quo minus dimicare vellet,
 movebatur,
 atque hoc etiam magis,
 quod spatii brevitate etiam in fugam coniectis adversariis non multum ad summam
 victoria iuvare poterat. 

Non enim amplius pedum milibus duobus ab castris castra distabant; 
hinc duas partes acies occupabant duae; 
tertia vacabat ad incursum atque impetum militum relicta. 

Si proelium committeretur,
 propinquitas castrorum celerem superatis ex fuga receptum dabat. 

Hac de causa constituerat signa inferentibus resistere,
 prior proelio non lacessere.


Two days were taken in these labors and plans;
by the third day a great part of Caesar's work had already been done.
In order to prevent the completion of the fortifications,
the enemy called the men to arms, drew up their legions and formed a line of
battle before their camp.

Caesar called his legions back from their labor,
ordered all the horse to assemble and drew up a line of battle;
for contrary to the conjecture and rumor of all the soldiers,
he annouced that a battle seemed to have escaped a great defeat.

But for the same reasons that were known,
with whom he was less willing to fight,
he was disturbed,
and by this even more,
that even with his adverseries thrown into flight in short space
he had not been able to aid much to the principal matter of victory.

For they were not more than two miles away from the camp;
from here two lines of battle occupied two sides;
the third was open to attack and assault and bereft of soldiers.

If a battle was joined,
the nearness of the camp would offer a quick retreat to those overwhelmed.

For this reason he had resolved to halt to/by those carrying the standards,
before to/by the battle to (be) provoke(d).
