83.1 

Acies erat Afraniana duplex legionum V;
 tertium in subsidiis locum alariae cohortes obtinebant;
 Caesaris triplex;
 sed primam aciem quaternae cohortes ex V legionibus tenebant,
 has subsidiariae ternae et rursus aliae totidem suae
 cuiusque legionis subsequebantur;
 sagittarii funditoresque media continebantur acie,
 equitatus latera cingebat. 

Tali instructa acie tenere uterque propositum videbatur:
 Caesar, ne nisi coactus proelium committeret;
 ille, ut opera Caesaris impediret. 

Producitur tamen res, aciesque ad solis occasum continentur;
 inde utrique in castra discedunt. 

Postero die munitiones institutas Caesar parat perficere;
 illi vadum fluminis Sicoris temptare, si transire possent. 

Qua re animadversa Caesar Germanos levis armaturae
 equitumque partem flumen traicit crebrasque in ripis custodias disponit.


Afranius' line of battle was two-fold of five legions;
a third in reserve >place the cohorts of the wing were maintained;
Caesar's was three-fold;
but >first line of four each cohorts out of five legions was being held,
>these of reserve three each and back again of another as many self's
and whose of legion were following close behind;
archers and slingers were maintaining/securing the middle of the line,
the cavalry ringed the flanks.

by such an equipped line of battle to hold either/both purpose he considered;
Caesar, not unles/except compelled would engage in battle;
he, to hinder Caesar's labors.

the thing is revealed nevertheless, and the battle lines were secured to the
only end; from there and which/each into camp withdraws.

the next day the fortifications having been set up, Caesar prepared to
accomplish; they ford of the river Sicorus to attempt, if to cross they might be
able.

by which thing having observed Caesar >Germans of light armor
and part of the cavalry transfixed the river
and onto the crowded banks he stationed guards.
