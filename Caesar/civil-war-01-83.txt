83.1 

Acies erat Afraniana duplex legionum V;
 tertium in subsidiis locum alariae cohortes obtinebant;
 Caesaris triplex;
 sed primam aciem quaternae cohortes ex V legionibus tenebant,
 has subsidiariae ternae et rursus aliae totidem suae
 cuiusque legionis subsequebantur;
 sagittarii funditoresque media continebantur acie,
 equitatus latera cingebat. 

Tali instructa acie tenere uterque propositum videbatur:
 Caesar, ne nisi coactus proelium committeret;
 ille, ut opera Caesaris impediret. 

Producitur tamen res, aciesque ad solis occasum continentur;
 inde utrique in castra discedunt. 

Postero die munitiones institutas Caesar parat perficere;
 illi vadum fluminis Sicoris temptare, si transire possent. 

Qua re animadversa Caesar Germanos levis armaturae
 equitumque partem flumen traicit crebrasque in ripis custodias disponit.


Afranius' battle array had two lines of five legions;
the cohorts on the wings kept a third (post) in reserve.
Caesar's had three lines;
but every fourth cohort of five legions held the first line,
three each and the same number of other legions, theirs and whose, backed them up;
archers and slingers secured the center of the line,
the cavalry ringed the flanks.
Either man's purpose seemed to hold with such a line of battle;
Caesar, to not engage in battle not unless forced to;
the enemy, to hinder Caesar's labors.
Nevertheless the business stretches out
and the battle lines hold fast until sundown; 
after that both sides withdraw to camp.
On the next day Caesar prepared to complete the fortifications that he'd started;
the enemy attempts the ford of the river Sicorus, to see if they could cross it.
When Caesar observed this he sent lightly armored Germans
and part of the cavalry across the river
and he stationed numerous guards on the banks.
