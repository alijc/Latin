84.1
Tandem omnibus rebus obsessi,
 quartum iam diem sine pabulo retentis iumentis,
 aquae, lignorum, frumenti inopia colloquium petunt et id,
 si fieri possit, semoto a militibus loco. 

Ubi id a Caesare negatum et, palam si colloqui vellent, concessum est,
 datur obsidis loco Caesari filius Afranii. 

Venitur in eum locum, quem Caesar delegit. 

Audiente utroque exercitu loquitur Afranius:
 non esse aut ipsis aut militibus succensendum,
 quod fidem erga imperatorem suum Cn. Pompeium conservare voluerint. 

Sed satis iam fecisse officio
 satisque supplicii tulisse perpessos omnium rerum inopiam;
 nunc vero paene ut feras circummunitos prohiberi aqua,
 prohiberi ingressu,
 neque corpore dolorem neque animo ignominiam ferre posse. 

Itaque se victos confiteri;
 orare atque obsecrare,
 si qui locus misericordiae relinquatur,
 ne ad ultimum supplicium progredi necesse habeat. 

Haec quam potest demississime et subiectissime exponit.


At last, with them blocked in in every direction,
held in check for a fourth day now without forage for their beasts,
and lacking water, firewood, and grain, they requested a parlay.
And that it, if at all possible, be far off from the soldiers.

When this was refused by Caesar, but granted if they were willing to parley 
openly, Afranius' son was given as a hostage in the place of Caesar. 

It is sold/come into the place, that Caesar chose.

Afranius speaks with both armies listening:
that they shouldn't be judged by either themselves or by their soldiers,
because they wished to maintain their loyalty towards their general Cn. Pompey.

But they'd now done their duty sufficiently
and the men who had endured their fill of suffering had borne all depravations;
now truly almost like wild beasts they were hemmed in men and kept from water,
to prevent approach,
and that they couldn't bear either the suffering in their bodies or the dishonor
in their souls. 

And so self >surviving men to confess/allow;
to beg and implore,
if who/how/which place of mercy be abandoned,
lest to the bitter end of punishment/supplication to proceed he would hold
necessary. 

He explained these things as humbly and nearly as he could.
