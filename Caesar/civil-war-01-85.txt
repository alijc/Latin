85.1 Ad ea Caesar respondit: nulli omnium has partes vel querimoniae vel
miserationis minus convenisse.  Reliquos enim omnes officium suum
praestitisse: se, qui etiam bona condicione, et loco et tempore aequo,
confligere noluerit, ut quam integerrima essent ad pacem omnia; exercitum
suum, qui iniuria etiam accepta suisque interfectis, quos in sua potestate
habuerit, conservarit et texerit; illius denique exercitus milites, qui per
se de concilianda pace egerint; qua in re omnium suorum vitae consulendum
putarint.  Sic omnium ordinum partes in misericordia constitisse: ipsos
duces a pace abhorruisse; eos neque colloquii neque indutiarum iura servasse
et homines imperitos et per colloquium deceptos crudelissime interfecisse.
Accidisse igitur his, quod plerumque hominum nimia pertinacia atque
arrogantia accidere soleat, uti eo recurrant et id cupidissime petant, quod
paulo ante contempserint.  Neque nunc se illorum humilitate neque aliqua
temporis opportunitate postulare, quibus rebus opes augeantur suae; sed eos
exercitus, quos contra se multos iam annos aluerint, velle dimitti.  Neque
enim sex legiones alia de causa missas in Hispaniam septimamque ibi
conscriptam neque tot tantasque classes paratas neque submissos duces rei
militaris peritos.  Nihil horum ad pacandas Hispanias, nihil ad usum
provinciae provisum, quae propter diuturnitatem pacis nullum auxilium
desiderarit.  Omnia haec iam pridem contra se parari; in se novi generis
imperia constitui, ut idem ad portas urbanis praesideat rebus et duas
bellicosissimas provincias absens tot annis obtineat; in se iura
magistratuum commutari, ne ex praetura et consulatu, ut semper, sed per
paucos probati et electi in provincias mittantur; in se etiam aetatis
excusationem nihil valere, cum superioribus bellis probati ad obtinendos
exercitus evocentur; in se uno non servari, quod sit omnibus datum semper
imperatoribus, ut rebus feliciter gestis aut cum honore aliquo aut certe
sine ignominia domum revertantur exercitumque dimittant.  Quae tamen omnia
et se tulisse patienter et esse laturum; neque nunc id agere, ut ab illis
abductum exercitum teneat ipse, quod tamen sibi difficile non sit, sed ne
illi habeant, quo contra se uti possint.  Proinde, ut esset dictum,
provinciis excederent exercitumque dimitterent; si id sit factum, se
nociturum nemini.  Hanc unam atque extremam esse pacis condicionem.

Caesar made reply to this: That these factions had met in no way less of
either complaint or sympathy.  For the survivors had excelled in all their
duty: he himself, though still in fighting trim, and equal in place and
time, didn't wish to fight, so that they would be as whole as possible in
all respects for reconciliation; his army, even though they had taken injury
and seen their fellows killed, spared and protected the men that they held
in their power; in the end the soldiers of that army, who of their own
accord brought about a reconciliation; through which they'd thought to look
out for their own lives.  Thus the factions of all ranks had stood together
in compassion: while those other leaders had turned away from peace; they
had preserved the law through neither parlay or truce and had most cruelly
killed inexperienced and trapped men through parleys.  And so to these men
had happened what often happens to very many of the most stubborn and
arrogant men, that they'd turn around and beg most eagerly for what they had
been contemptuous of a little before.  But now he demanded, not due to
either their humility or to any favorable circumstances, or for matters that
would increase his own power; but that he wished to disband the armies that
they had maintained against him for many years now.  For neither the six
legions sent into Spain on some other pretext and the seven levied there nor
so many and so large levies fitted out or placed under leaders experienced
in military matters.  None of these were meant for the pacification of
Spain, none was provided for the use of the province, which hadn't requested
aid, on account of the long duration of peace.  All these things had been
readied against himself for a long time; new sorts of injunctions were set
up against him, so that the same man would stand guard at the gates of the
city and occupy the two most warlike provinces remotely for so many years;
the civil law was entirely altered to his detriment, so that the men sent to
the provinces were not from the praetorship or consulship, as had always
been, but through the approval and selection of a few men; even the excuse
of age no longer prevailed when the approved men were called up to serve in
the army for the the aforesaid wars; against he alone was the custom, which
had always been given to generals, not kept, with the business happily
fulfilled, either with honor, or at least without disgrace, that they could
return home and disband the army.  Nevertheless, he had borne all of this
patiently and would continue to bear it; and he wouldn't now do what
wouldn't be difficult for him, that is, to hold on to the army that he
himself had drawn away from those men, so that they wouldn't have what they
could use against him.  So then, as he had already said, they should
withdraw to their provinces and disband the army; if this was done, he
himself would harm no one.  This was the single and final condition for
peace.
