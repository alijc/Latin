86.1 
Id vero militibus fuit pergratum et iucundum,
 ut ex ipsa significatione cognosci potuit,
 ut, qui aliquid iusti incommodi exspectavissent,
 ultro praemium missionis ferrent. 

Nam cum de loco et tempore eius rei controversia inferretur,
 et voce et manibus universi ex vallo,
 ubi constiterant,
 significare coeperunt,
 ut statim dimitterentur,
 neque omni interposita fide firmum esse posse,
 si in aliud tempus differretur. 

Paucis cum esset in utramque partem verbis disputatum,
 res huc deducitur,
 ut ei, qui habeant domicilium aut possessionem in Hispania, statim,
 reliqui ad Varum flumen dimittantur;
 ne quid eis noceatur, neu quis invitus sacramentum dicere cogatur,
 a Caesare cavetur.


Surely it was pleasing and agreeable to the soldiers,
that it could be recognized from this sign, that, 
whoever might have expected anything of a disagreeable justice/just setback,
would, on the other hand, win the the reward of his discharge.

For when the dispute about the place and time for their meeting was brought up,
and everyone had begun to indicate by voice and signs from where they stood on
the pallisade, that they should be demobilized at once,
and he could not be secure with each alleged good faith,
if it was delayed until another time.

After it had been discussed in a few words on both sides,
the matter was brought to this point,
that they be demobilized.  
Those had homes or property in Spain, straight off,
and the rest to the Varus River.
so that nothing would be harmed by them, 
and that any man who was not willing to give an oath of allegiance,
would be avoided by Caesar.
