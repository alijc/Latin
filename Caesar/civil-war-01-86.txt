86.1 
Id vero militibus fuit pergratum et iucundum,
 ut ex ipsa significatione cognosci potuit,
 ut, qui aliquid iusti incommodi exspectavissent,
 ultro praemium missionis ferrent. 

Nam cum de loco et tempore eius rei controversia inferretur,
 et voce et manibus universi ex vallo,
 ubi constiterant,
 significare coeperunt,
 ut statim dimitterentur,
 neque omni interposita fide firmum esse posse,
 si in aliud tempus differretur. 

Paucis cum esset in utramque partem verbis disputatum,
 res huc deducitur,
 ut ei, qui habeant domicilium aut possessionem in Hispania, statim,
 reliqui ad Varum flumen dimittantur;
 ne quid eis noceatur, neu quis invitus sacramentum dicere cogatur,
 a Caesare cavetur.


Truly it to/by soldiers was pleasing and agreeable,
so that for this suggestion to have been learned he could,
so that, who might have expected anything of disagreeable justice/just setback,
besides the reward of discharge might bear.

For when from the place and time their for/of thing the controversy was brought
in, and to/by voice and hands all men out of the stake,
where they had made a stand,
to show they began,
so that they might be disbanded at once,
and not all men/to each with alleged faith to be able to be,
if into another time it was delayed.

to/by a little when it was into each side to/by word debated,
the matter to here is led,
so that they, who might have a home or property in Spain, at once,
(of) the remaining(s) to the Varus River might be disbanded/sent away;
lest which thing to/by them might be harmed or to/by which men/which man
unwilling forced to give an oath of allegiance,
by Caesar he was avoided/bewared.
