[87] Caesar ex eo tempore, dum ad flumen Varum veniatur, se
frumentum daturum pollicetur.  Addit etiam, ut, quod quisque eorum
in bello amiserit, quae sint penes milites suos, eis, qui amiserint,
restituatur; militibus aequa facta aestimatione pecuniam pro his
rebus dissolvit.  Quascumque postea controversias inter se milites
habuerunt, sua sponte ad Caesarem in ius adierunt.  Petreius atque
Afranius cum stipendium ab legionibus paene seditione facta
flagitarentur, cuius illi diem nondum venisse dicerent, Caesar ut
cognosceret, postulatum est, eoque utrique, quod statuit, contenti
fuerunt.  Parte circiter tertia exercitus eo biduo dimissa duas
legiones suas antecedere, reliquas subsequi iussit, ut non longo
inter se spatio castra facerent, eique negotio Q. Fufium Calenum
legatum praeficit.  Hoc eius praescripto ex Hispania ad Varum flumen
est iter factum, atque ibi reliqua pars exercitus dimissa est.

Caesar promised that he would hand out supplies until they'd
reached the Varus River.  He also added that if, during the war,
any man had lost aught that was now in the hands of his own
soldiers, it would be restored to those who had lost it; he paid
his own soldiers a fair estimation of money for these things.
Afterwards, whatever debates the soldiers held among themselves, of
their own free will they came to Caesar for a decision.  When
Petreius and Afranius had been pressed by the legions for their
pay, nearly to the point of a riot, after they said that their
payday hadn't yet arrived, it was demanded for Caesar to look into
it and decide, and both sides were content with what he determined.
About a third of the army was dismissed within two days.  He
commanded two of his legions to precede them and the rest to
follow, so that the camps wouldn't be far apart, and he put
Q. Fufius Calenus in charge as legate to perform the task.  By this
order of his the journey was made out of Spain to the Varus River,
and there the rest of the army was dismissed.
