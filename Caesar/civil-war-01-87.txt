[87] Caesar ex eo tempore, dum ad flumen Varum veniatur, se
frumentum daturum pollicetur.  Addit etiam, ut, quod quisque eorum
in bello amiserit, quae sint penes milites suos, eis, qui amiserint,
restituatur; militibus aequa facta aestimatione pecuniam pro his
rebus dissolvit.  Quascumque postea controversias inter se milites
habuerunt, sua sponte ad Caesarem in ius adierunt.  Petreius atque
Afranius cum stipendium ab legionibus paene seditione facta
flagitarentur, cuius illi diem nondum venisse dicerent, Caesar ut
cognosceret, postulatum est, eoque utrique, quod statuit, contenti
fuerunt.  Parte circiter tertia exercitus eo biduo dimissa duas
legiones suas antecedere, reliquas subsequi iussit, ut non longo
inter se spatio castra facerent, eique negotio Q. Fufium Calenum
legatum praeficit.  Hoc eius praescripto ex Hispania ad Varum flumen
est iter factum, atque ibi reliqua pars exercitus dimissa est.

Caesar himself, due to the time that it would take to reach the
Varus River, promised to give out suppies.  He also added that if,
during the war, any man had lost aught that was now in the hands of
his own soldiers, it would be restored to those who had lost it; he
paid his own soldiers a fair estimation of money for these things.
After the soldiers held debates among themselves, of their own free
will they approached Caesar according to the law.  When Petreius and
Afranius had been pressed by the legions for their pay, nearly to
the point of a riot, after they said that their payday hadn't yet
arrived, it was demanded that Caesar look into it and establish, to
him and them both, that they had been held together.  About a third
of the army was dismissed within two days.  He commanded two of his
legions to precede them and the rest to follow, so that the camps
wouldn't make a long space between them, and he put Q. Fufius
Calenus in charge as legate to perform the task.  By this order of
his the journey was made out of Spain to the Varus River, and there
the rest of the army was dismissed.
