2.1
Dum haec in Hispania geruntur, C. Trebonius legatus,
qui ad oppugnationem Massiliae relictus erat,
duabus ex partibus aggerem,
vineas turresque ad oppidum agere instituit.

Una erat proxima portui navalibusque, altera ad portam,
qua est aditus ex Gallia atque Hispania, ad id mare,
quod adiacet ad ostium Rhodani.

Massilia enim fere tribus ex oppidi partibus mari alluitur;
reliqua quarta est, quae aditum habeat ab terra.

Huius quoque spatii pars ea,
quae ad arcem pertinet,
loci natura et valle altissima munita longam et difficilem habet oppugnationem.

Ad ea perficienda opera C. Trebonius magnam iumentorum
atque hominum multitudinem ex omni provincia vocat;
vimina materiamque comportari iubet.

Quibus comparatis rebus aggerem in altitudinem pedum LXXX exstruit.


While these matters were going on in Spain, Caesar's officer C. Trebonius,
who had stayed behind to launch an assault on Massilia,
started to build before the town, from either end, a rampart with
siege shelters and towers.

One end was near the port and the docks and the other by the city gate,
which gives access from Gaul and Spain, and the sea,
which lies next to the mouth of the Rhone River.

For Massilia is nearly awash on three sides by the sea;
the other side is the one that gives an approach from land.

This is also the side that extends up to the citadel.
The nature of the site and the high fortified pallisade makes for a long and
difficult siege.

For the completion of these fortifications C. Trebonius called up a great
multitude of men and beasts from the entire province;
he ordered twigs and wood to be transported.

By these preparations he raised the rampart to a height of 80 feet.
