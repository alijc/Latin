Book I section 1: [1] Litteris C. Caesaris consulibus redditis aegre ab his
impetratum est summa tribunorum plebis contentione, ut in senatu recitarentur;
ut vero ex litteris ad senatum referretur, impetrari non potuit. Referunt
consules de re publica [in civitate]. [Incitat] L. Lentulus consul senatu rei
publicae se non defuturum pollicetur, si audacter ac fortiter sententias dicere
velint; sin Caesarem respiciant atque eius gratiam sequantur, ut superioribus
fecerint temporibus, se sibi consilium capturum neque senatus auctoritati
obtemperaturum: habere se quoque ad Caesaris gratiam atque amicitiam
receptum. In eandem sententiam loquitur Scipio: Pompeio esse in animo rei
publicae non deesse, si senatus sequatur; si cunctetur atque agat lenius,
nequiquam eius auxilium, si postea velit, senatum imploraturum.

By the letter of C. Caesar, returned by the consuls with difficulty by
these the greatest outcry of the people's tribunes was brought to pass for
it to be read aloud in the senate; so that by the letter it might be
carried back to the senate, it could not be obtained.

The consuls bring it back [to the city] from the republic.

Consul L. Lentulus [aroused] himself by the senate of the republic promises that
he would not fail, if they were willing to speak their opinions boldly and
bravely; but if they were to respect Caesar and seek his support, 
in order to create better conditions, then they should seize the council for
themselves and should not submit to the authority of the senate.

that they would have Caesar's gratitude and friendship.

Scipio speaks in this way of thinking:

that to Pompey it is in the heart of the republic not missing,
if the senate were to follow;
if he were to pause and act more gently,
he would, if he later wished to, ask for help from the senate in vain.
