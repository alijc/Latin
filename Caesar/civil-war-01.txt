Book I section 1: 

Litteris C. Caesaris consulibus redditis aegre ab his impetratum est
summa tribunorum plebis contentione, ut in senatu recitarentur; ut vero
ex litteris ad senatum referretur, impetrari non potuit. Referunt
consules de re publica [in civitate]. [Incitat] L. Lentulus consul senatu
rei publicae se non defuturum pollicetur, si audacter ac fortiter
sententias dicere velint; sin Caesarem respiciant atque eius gratiam
sequantur, ut superioribus fecerint temporibus, se sibi consilium
capturum neque senatus auctoritati obtemperaturum: habere se quoque ad
Caesaris gratiam atque amicitiam receptum. In eandem sententiam loquitur
Scipio: Pompeio esse in animo rei publicae non deesse, si senatus
sequatur; si cunctetur atque agat lenius, nequiquam eius auxilium, si
postea velit, senatum imploraturum.

After the letter of C. Caesar was delivered to the consuls, permission
was obtained, with difficulty and by means of the supreme effort of the
people's tribunes, for it to be read out in the senate.  But permission
for actually opening a debate on the letter at the senate could not be
obtained.  The consuls debate on the republic.  Consul L. Lentulus,
promises the republic that he will not be fail the senate, if they are
willing to speak their opinions boldly and bravely; but if they were to
respect Caesar and seek his favor, as had often happened in the past,
then he would take his own council and would not submit to the authority
of the senate, as he was likewise sure to have Caesar's gratitude and
friendship.  In the same vein Scipio speaks: that Pompey would not desert
the republic, if the senate would follow him; but if it were to hesitate
and be remiss, then the senate would, if it later wished to, ask for help
in vain.
