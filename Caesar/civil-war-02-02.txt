2.2 Sed tanti erant antiquitus in oppido omnium rerum ad bellum
apparatus tantaque multitudo tormentorum, ut eorum vim nullae
contextae viminibus vineae sustinere possent.  Asseres enim pedum XII
cuspidibus praefixi atque hi maximis ballistis missi per IIII ordines
cratium in terra defigebantur.  Itaque pedalibus lignis coniunctis
inter se porticus integebantur, atque hac agger inter manus
proferebatur.  Antecedebat testudo pedum LX aequandi loci causa facta
item ex fortissimis lignis, convoluta omnibus rebus, quibus ignis
iactus et lapides defendi possent.  Sed magnitudo operum, altitudo
muri atque turrium, multitudo tormentorum omnem administrationem
tardabat.  Crebrae etiam per Albicos eruptiones fiebant ex oppido
ignesque aggeri et turribus inferebantur; quae facile nostri milites
repellebant magnisque ultro illatis detrimentis eos, qui eruptionem
fecerant, in oppidum reiciebant.


But the town had long held so many engines of war of all sorts, and
with such a great number of catapults, so powerful that mere vines
braided with twigs couldn't withstand them.  For they used 12-foot
poles with blades fixed to their heads and these, hurled by the great
ballistas, would be thrust through 4 layers of wickerwork and then
into the ground.  And so the siegeworks were covered with wood a foot
around joined together, and by means of this the rampart was advanced
by the corps.  A testudo, 60 feet long, travelled ahead in order to
level the site.  It was also made from a very strong wood, woven with
all sorts of things by which they could repel the fire and stones
that were hurled at them.  But the size of the fortifications, the
height of the wall and towers, and the great number of catapults
delayed each operation.  Also frequent sorties from the town took
place across the Elbe and fires were breaking out on the rampart and
towers.  Our men easily fended off these attacks, and moreover, after
inflicting damage on those who had made the sorties, drove them back
into the town.
