Sed tanti erant antiquitus in oppido omnium rerum ad bellum apparatus
tantaque multitudo tormentorum,
ut eorum vim nullae contextae viminibus vineae sustinere possent.
Asseres enim pedum XII cuspidibus praefixi
atque hi maximis ballistis missi per IIII ordines cratium in terra defigebantur.
Itaque pedalibus lignis coniunctis inter se porticus integebantur,
atque hac agger inter manus proferebatur.
Antecedebat testudo pedum LX aequandi loci causa facta item ex fortissimis
lignis, convoluta omnibus rebus, quibus ignis iactus et lapides defendi
possent.
Sed magnitudo operum,
altitudo muri atque turrium,
multitudo tormentorum omnem administrationem tardabat.
Crebrae etiam per Albicos eruptiones fiebant ex oppido ignesque aggeri et
turribus inferebantur;
quae facile nostri milites repellebant magnisque ultro illatis detrimentis eos,
qui eruptionem fecerant,
in oppidum reiciebant.


But so many engines of war of all sorts had long been in the town,
and with such a great number of catapults,
so powerful that vines braided with twigs couldn't hold them.
For 12-foot poles with spearheads were fixed in front
and these, hurled by the great ballistas, would be thrust through 4 layers of
wickerwork in the ground.
And so the siegeworks were covered with foot-long sticks connected between them,
and by means of this the rampart between hands/corps was advanced.
A testudo travelled 60 feet in advance in order to level the site.
It was also made from a very strong wood, woven with all sorts of things
by which they'd be able to repel hurled fire and stones.
But the size of the fortifications, the height of the wall and towers,
and the great number of catapults delayed each operation.
Also frequent sorties from the town took place across the Elbe
and fires were breaking out on the rampart and towers.
Our men easily fended off these attacks, 
and further, after inflicting damage on those who had made the sorties,
drove them back into the town.
