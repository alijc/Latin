3.1
Interim L Nasidius, a Cn. Pompeio cum classe navium XVI,
in quibus paucae erant aeratae,
L. Domitio Massiliensibusque subsidio missus,
freto Siciliae imprudente atque inopinante Curione pervehitur
appulsisque Messanam navibus atque inde propter repentinum terrorem principum ac
senatus fuga facta navem ex navalibus eorum deducit.

Hac adiuncta ad reliquas naves cursum Massiliam versus perficit praemissaque
 clam navicula Domitium Massiliensesque de suo adventu certiores facit eosque
 magnopere hortatur,
 ut rursus cum Bruti classe additis suis auxiliis confligant.


Meanwhile, L. Nasidius,
whom Pompey had sent to relieve L. Domitius and the Massilians
with a fleet of 16 ships, including a few with bronze fittings,
is conveyed through the strait of Sicily to an unsuspecting and off guard Curio
and by ships landed at Messana and then due to the sudden 
alarm of the leaders and the senate, having taken flight,
he launches the ship from their docks.


by this(f) bound to the rest of the ships he finishes a course towards Massilia
and having been sent ahead in secret a small ship to Domitius and the Massilians
about his coming more surely makes/does
and >them greatly he urges,
so that back with Brutus's fleet with his added assistance they
might do combat.
