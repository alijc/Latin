2.3
Interim L Nasidius, a Cn. Pompeio cum classe navium XVI,
in quibus paucae erant aeratae,
L. Domitio Massiliensibusque subsidio missus,
freto Siciliae imprudente atque inopinante Curione pervehitur
appulsisque Messanam navibus atque inde propter repentinum terrorem principum ac
senatus fuga facta navem ex navalibus eorum deducit.

Hac adiuncta ad reliquas naves cursum Massiliam versus perficit praemissaque
 clam navicula Domitium Massiliensesque de suo adventu certiores facit eosque
 magnopere hortatur,
 ut rursus cum Bruti classe additis suis auxiliis confligant.


Meanwhile, L. Nasidius,
whom Pompey had sent to relieve L. Domitius and the Massilians
with a fleet of 16 ships, including a few with bronze fittings,
is conveyed through the strait of Sicily by an unsuspecting and off guard Curio
and by ships landed at Messana and then, due to the sudden 
alarm of their leaders and senate, he takes flight and
launches his ship from their docks.
After joining his ship with the rest he sets a course towards Massilia
and, after secretly sending a small boat ahead to Domitius and the Massilians
with news of his own assured arrival,
he particularly encourages them to again fight,
with Brutus's fleet and his additional auxiliaries.
