4.1 Massilienses post superius incommodum veteres ad eundem numerum
ex navalibus productas naves refecerant summaque industria
armaverant (remigum, gubernatorum magna copia suppetebat)
piscatoriasque adiecerant atque contexerant, ut essent ab ictu
telorum remiges tuti; has sagittariis tormentisque compleverunt.
Tali modo instructa classe omnium seniorum, matrum familiae,
virginum precibus et fletu excitati, extremo tempore civitati
subvenirent, non minore animo ac fiducia, quam ante dimicaverant,
naves conscendunt.  Communi enim fit vitio naturae, ut inusitatis
atque incognitis rebus magis confidamus vehementiusque exterreamur;
ut tum accidit.  Adventus enim L. Nasidii summa spe et voluntate
civitatem compleverat.  Nacti idoneum ventum ex portu exeunt et
Tauroenta, quod est castellum Massilensium, ad Nasidium perveniunt
ibique naves expediunt rursusque se ad confligendum animo confirmant
et consilia communicant.  Dextra pars attribuitur Massiliensibus,
sinistra Nasidio.


After the aforesaid setback, the Massilians had drawn out nearly the
same number of older ships from the docks and refurbished them and
equipped them with the utmost industry (they had a large number of
oarsmen and helmsmen available).  They also had added fishing boats
and roofed them over, to keep the the oarsmen safe from a flight of
darts.  They'd finished these up with archers and catapults.  With
the fleet fitted in this way, stirred up by the prayers and weeping
of all of the old men, matriarchs and maidens, for them to aid the
city in those desparate times, they boarded the ships with no less
courage and faith than they had previously done battle.  For it
commonly happens, through a fault of nature, that we have more
confidence in and are more frightened by strange and unexpected
things; as happened then.  The arrival of L. Nasidius had filled the
city with the utmost hope and good will.  When they obtained a
favorable wind they sailed out of port and met up with Nasidius at
Tauroenta, Massilia's fortress, and there readied their ships.  With
spirit they declared that they were once again ready for the fight,
and shared their plans.  The right wing was assigned to the
Massilians, the left to Nasidius.
