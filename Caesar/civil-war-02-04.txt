4.1
Massilienses post superius incommodum veteres ad eundem numerum ex navalibus
productas naves refecerant summaque industria armaverant
(remigum, gubernatorum magna copia suppetebat)
piscatoriasque adiecerant atque contexerant,
ut essent ab ictu telorum remiges tuti;
has sagittariis tormentisque compleverunt.

Tali modo instructa classe omnium seniorum, matrum familiae, virginum precibus
 et fletu excitati, extremo tempore civitati subvenirent,
 non minore animo ac fiducia, quam ante dimicaverant, naves conscendunt.

Communi enim fit vitio naturae,
ut inusitatis atque incognitis rebus magis confidamus vehementiusque
exterreamur; ut tum accidit.

Adventus enim L. Nasidii summa spe et voluntate civitatem compleverat.

Nacti idoneum ventum ex portu exeunt et Tauroenta,
quod est castellum Massilensium,
ad Nasidium perveniunt ibique naves expediunt rursusque se ad confligendum animo
confirmant et consilia communicant.

Dextra pars attribuitur Massiliensibus, sinistra Nasidio.


After the aforesaid setback, the Massilians had refurbished nearly the same
number of older ships that they had brought out from the docks
and equipped with the utmost industry
(they had a large number of oarsmen and helmsmen available)
and they had added fishing boats and roofed them over,
to keep the the oarsmen safe from a flight of darts:
they'd finished up these ships with archers and catapults.

With the fleet fitted in this way, stirred up by the prayers and weeping of all
the old men, the mothers of the households, and the maidens,
that they might aid the city in those desparate times,
they boarded the ships
with no less courage and faith than they had previously done battle. 

For it commonly happens through a fault of nature,
that we believe in more strange and unknown things
and are very frightened; so that it then happens.

The arrival of L. Nasidius had filled the city with the utmost hope and good
will.

Having obtained a favorable wind they sailed out of port and met up with
Nasidius at Tauroenta, which is Massilia's fortress, and there readied their
ships.  With spirit they declared that they were once again ready for the fight,
and shared their plans. 

The right wing was assigned to the Massilians, the left to Nasidius.
