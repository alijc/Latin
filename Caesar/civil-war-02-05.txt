5.1 Eodem Brutus contendit aucto navium numero.  Nam ad eas, quae
factae erant Arelate per Caesarem, captivae Massiliensium
accesserant sex.  Has superioribus diebus refecerat atque omnibus
rebus instruxerat.  Itaque suos cohortatus, quos integros
superarissent ut victos contemnerent, plenus spei bonae atque
animi adversus eos proficiscitur.  Facile erat ex castris
C. Trebonii atque omnibus superioribus locis prospicere in urbem,
ut omnis iuventus, quae in oppido remanserat, omnesque superioris
aetatis cum liberis atque uxoribus ex publicis locis custodiisque
aut e muro ad caelum manus tenderent, aut templa deorum
immortalium adirent et ante simulacra proiecti victoriam ab diis
exposcerent.  Neque erat quisquam omnium, quin in eius diei casu
suarum omnium fortunarum eventum consistere existimaret.  Nam et
honesti ex iuventute et cuiusque aetatis amplissimi nominatim
evocati atque obsecrati naves conscenderant ut, si quid adversi
accidisset, ne ad conandum quidem sibi quicquam reliqui fore
viderent; si superavissent, vel domesticis opibus vel externis
auxiliis de salute urbis confiderent.


Brutus also had more ships to fight with.  For they'd added six
ships, captured from the Massilians, to those that had been built
at Arles on Caesar's command.  He had repaired these in the
succeeding days and had prepared them in every way.  And so having
exhorted his men to look down on those whom they had beaten when
they were fresh, he set out, filled with hope and a good spirit,
to face the enemy.  From the camp of C. Trebonius and from all the
high places it was easy to see into the city, that all the young
men who had remained in the town, and all the older men, with
their children and wives, stretched their hands out to heaven from
the common areas or watch posts or the city wall, or visited the
temples of the immortal gods, and throwing themselves down before
the images, begged the gods for victory.  And there wasn't anyone
at all that didn't think that the fate of all their fortunes
depended on the outcome of this day.  For the distinguished men,
both the youths and those of a greater age, had been called by
name and entreated to board the ships, so that if anything
untoward happened, so that they saw that no-one would be left to
try again.  But if they gained the victory, through either their
own strength or the support of others, they'd be assured about the
prosperity of their city.
