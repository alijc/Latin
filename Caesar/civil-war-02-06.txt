6.1
Commisso proelio Massiliensibus res nulla ad virtutem defuit;
sed memores eorum praeceptorum,
quae paulo ante ab suis aeceperant,
hoc animo decertabant,
ut nullum aliud tempus ad conandum habituri viderentur,
et quibus in pugna vitae periculum accideret,
non ita multo se reliquorum civium fatum antecedere existimarent,
quibus urbe capta eadem esset belli fortuna patienda.

Diductisque nostris paulatim navibus et artificio gubernatorum et mobilitati
navium locus dabatur,
et si quando nostri facultatem nacti ferreis manibus iniectis navem
religaverant,
undique suis laborantibus succurrebant.

Neque vero coniuncti Albici comminus pugnando deficiebant neque multum cedebant
virtute nostris.

Simul ex minoribus navibus magna vis eminus missa telorum multa nostris de
improviso imprudentibus atque impeditis vulnera inferebant.

Conspicataeque naves triremes duae navem D. Bruti,
quae ex insigni facile agnosci poterat,
duabus ex partibus sese in eam incitaverant

Sed tantum re provisa Brutus celeritate navis enisus est,
ut parvo momento antecederet.

Illae adeo graviter inter se incitatae conflixerunt,
ut vehementissime utraque ex concursu laborarent,
altera vero praefracto rostro tota collabefieret.

Qua re animadversa,
quae proximae ei loco ex Bruti classe naves erant,
in eas impeditas impetum faciunt celeriterque ambas deprimunt.


When the battle was engaged, nothing failed the army of Massilia;
but, mindful of their teachers,
the things that a little before from selves had ???
by this spirit they were fighting to the end,
so that no other time to the endeavor they might seem to have,
and by which in battle of live the danger might happen,
not so much self of the rest of their countrymen the fate to outstrip they
thought,
by which with the very city taken to be the fortune of war for suffering.

And with our ships a little spread out and with skill of the pilots and the
agileness of the ships space was given,
and if our men ever got an opportunity they'd tie up a ship by hurling
grappling hooks, from every side by self's labor they raced to help.

And not truly connected white hand to hand fighting they were sinking
and not much they were falling back by virtue/strength to/by our men.

at the same time out of the lesser ships a great strength sent of spears many by
ourt men from unforeseen to the unwary and encumbered were bringing wounds.

And having caught sight of two trieme ships >ship of D. Brutus,
which from its insignia could easily be recognized,
to/by two of the region self into it pressed on.

But only by thing foreseen Brutus with haste brought the ships out,
so that in a short while he got ahead.

Those (ships) exactly violently between themselves urged on they clashed,
so that most vigorously and out of course they labored,
one truly with a broken bow totally sunk.

by which matter having been noticed,
which near to the place from Brutus to/by fleet ships were,
into the impeded ships >assault they made and quickly >both sank.
