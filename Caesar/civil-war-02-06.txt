6.1 Commisso proelio Massiliensibus res nulla ad virtutem
defuit; sed memores eorum praeceptorum, quae paulo ante ab
suis acceperant, hoc animo decertabant, ut nullum aliud
tempus ad conandum habituri viderentur, et quibus in pugna
vitae periculum accideret, non ita multo se reliquorum civium
fatum antecedere existimarent, quibus urbe capta eadem esset
belli fortuna patienda.  Diductisque nostris paulatim navibus
et artificio gubernatorum et mobilitati navium locus dabatur,
et si quando nostri facultatem nacti ferreis manibus iniectis
navem religaverant, undique suis laborantibus succurrebant.
Neque vero coniuncti Albici comminus pugnando deficiebant
neque multum cedebant virtute nostris.  Simul ex minoribus
navibus magna vis eminus missa telorum multa nostris de
improviso imprudentibus atque impeditis vulnera inferebant.
Conspicataeque naves triremes duae navem D. Bruti, quae ex
insigni facile agnosci poterat, duabus ex partibus sese in
eam incitaverant Sed tantum re provisa Brutus celeritate
navis enisus est, ut parvo momento antecederet.  Illae adeo
graviter inter se incitatae conflixerunt, ut vehementissime
utraque ex concursu laborarent, altera vero praefracto rostro
tota collabefieret.  Qua re animadversa, quae proximae ei
loco ex Bruti classe naves erant, in eas impeditas impetum
faciunt celeriterque ambas deprimunt.


At the commencement of the battle, nothing was lacking in the
courage of the Massilians.  Mindful of the lessons that they
had received a little before, they fought with the courage of
the utterly desperate, as they seemed to have no other chance
for the endeavor, and by which in the battle of their lives
the danger would befall them, not so much that they thought
that they would evade the fate of the rest of their
countrymen, who would suffer the fortunes of war if the city
were taken.  And with our ships a little spread out and with
skill of their pilots and the agileness of their ships they
gained a space.  Whenever our men got an opportunity they'd
tie up a ship by hurling grappling hooks, but they'd race in
from every side to help their comrades.  And indeed their
allies the Albici didn't falter in hand to hand fighting and
they didn't fall back much to the strength of our men.  At
the same time a great cast of spears from the smaller ships
was unexpectedly inflicting many wounds on our unsheltered
and encumbered men.  When two triemes caught sight of
D. Brutus' ship, which could easily be recognized from its
insignia, both rushed out from either side against it.  But
at this unexpected event Brutus hastily forced his ship
ahead, so that in a short while he outstripped them.  Indeed,
those ships had rushed in so violently that they crashed
together, and were both utterly befouled, and one of them was
completely disabled with a broken bow.  This happened close
to the place were Brutus and his fleet were, and after they
observed it they made an assault on the impeded ships and
quickly sank both of them.
