7.1
Sed Nasidianae naves nullo usui fuerunt celeriterque pugna excesserunt;
non enim has aut conspectus patriae aut propinquorum praecepta ad extremum vitae
periculum adire cogebant.

Itaque ex eo numero navium nulla desiderata est:
ex Massiliensium classe V sunt depressae, IV captae,
una cum Nasidianis profugit;
quae omnes citeriorem Hispaniam petiverunt.

At ex reliquis una praemissa Massiliam huius nuntii perferendi gratia cum iam
appropinquaret urbi,
omnis sese multitudo ad cognoscendum effudit,
et re cognita tantus luctus excepit,
ut urbs ab hostibus capta eodem vestigio videretur.

Massilienses tamen nihilo secius ad defensionem urbis reliqua apparare
coeperunt.

But the Nasidian ships were of no use and quickly withdrew from the battle;
for neither the sight of their country or the commands of their relatives
could compel them to undertake danger at the peril of their lives.

And so out of the number of our ships not one was lost:
of the Massilians' fleet 5 were sunk and 4 captured,
and one escaped with the Nasidians;
all of which headed for the near side of Spain.

But one of the remaining ships was sent ahead to Massilia,
of this messenger to announce gratitude when already/still he might get near to
the city,
everyone poured out in a crowd to learn the outcome,
and when they heard it, they received such grief
that the city might have seemed to be taken by the enemy on the same step.

Yet the Massilians nonetheless fitted out
the remaining ships for the defense of the city.
