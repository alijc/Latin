8.1
Est animadversum ab legionibus,
qui dextram partem operis administrabant,
ex crebris hostium eruptionibus magno sibi esse praesidio posse,
si ibi pro castello ac receptaculo turrim ex latere sub muro fecissent.

Quam primo ad repentinos incursus humilem parvamque fecerunt.

Huc se referebant; hinc,
si qua maior oppresserat vis, propugnabant;
hinc ad repellendum et prosequendum hostem procurrebant.

Patebat haec quoquoversus pedes XXX,
sed parietum crassitudo pedes V. Postea vero,
ut est rerum omnium magister usus,
hominum adhibita sollertia inventum est magno esse usui posse,
si haec esset in altitudinem turris elata.

Id hac ratione perfectum est.


The legions in charge of the right wing of the fortifications observed that they
could have protected themselves from the constant sallies of the enemy, if they
had made, there in front of the fortress and shelter, a tower from the
side/flank under the wall.

And at first they made this tower, low and small, to the unexpected assaults.

They were hieing to it;
because they were fighting on the defensive,
if any greater force overwhelmed them;
because they were advancing for driving off and pursuing the enemy.

It extended this for 30 feet in every direction,
but a thickness of the walls of 5 feet.
Indeed afterwards, since experience is the teacher of all things,
with the resourcefulness employed of men
it was realized that it would have been of great use,
if it had been raised to the height of a tower.

it by this reason/plan/account was completed.
