8.1 Est animadversum ab legionibus, qui dextram partem operis
administrabant, ex crebris hostium eruptionibus magno sibi esse
praesidio posse, si ibi pro castello ac receptaculo turrim ex
latere sub muro fecissent.  Quam primo ad repentinos incursus
humilem parvamque fecerunt.  Huc se referebant; hinc, si qua
maior oppresserat vis, propugnabant; hinc ad repellendum et
prosequendum hostem procurrebant.  Patebat haec quoquoversus
pedes XXX, sed parietum crassitudo pedes V. Postea vero, ut est
rerum omnium magister usus, hominum adhibita sollertia inventum
est magno esse usui posse, si haec esset in altitudinem turris
elata.  Id hac ratione perfectum est.


The legions in charge of the right wing of the fortifications
observed that they could have protected themselves from the
constant sallies of the enemy, if they had made, there in front
of the fortress and shelter, a tower jutting out of the side of
the base of the wall.  And at first they made one, low and
small, against unexpected assaults.  They would hie to it from
wherever they were fighting if a greater force overwhelmed them;
and they would advance from there to drive off and pursue the
enemy.  It extended for 30 feet in every direction, with walls 5
feet thick.  Indeed afterwards, since experience is the teacher
of all things, it was realized, with the resourcefulness
employed by men, that it would have been of great use if it had
been raised to the height of a tower.  It was completed
according to this plan.
