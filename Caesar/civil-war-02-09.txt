9.1 Ubi turris altitudo perducta est ad contabulationem, eam
in parietes instruxerunt, ita ut capita tignorum extrema
parietum structura tegerentur, ne quid emineret, ubi ignis
hostium adhaeresceret.  Hanc super contignationem, quantum
tectum plutei ac vinearum passum est, laterculo adstruxerunt
supraque eum locum duo tigna transversa iniecerunt non longe
ab extremis parietibus, quibus suspenderent eam
contignationem, quae turri tegimento esset futura, supraque
ea tigna directo transversas trabes iniecerunt easque axibus
religaverunt (has trabes paulo longiores atque eminentiores,
quam extremi parietes erant, effecerant, ut esset ubi
tegimenta praependere possent ad defendendos ictus ac
repellendos, cum infra eam contignationem parietes
exstruerentur) eamque contabulationem summam lateribus
lutoque constraverunt, ne quid ignis hostium nocere posset,
centonesque insuper iniecerunt, ne aut tela tormentis immissa
tabulationem perfringerent, aut saxa ex catapultis latericium
discuterent.


When the height of the tower was brought up to one story,
they fitted a platform into the walls, so that the ends of
the posts were covered by the outer structure of the walls,
to keep anything from sticking out where it could catch on
fire.  On top of this platform, as far as was allowed by the
protection of their breastworks and latticework, they piled
up bricks and set two cross-beams in place, not far from the
rear of the walls.  From this they hung a platform for
protecting the tower, and set lateral beams on it and
fastened on planks.  (They made these beams a little longer
than the breadth of the walls, to project out, so that they
could hang a covering in front to defend them while the walls
under the roof were being constructed.)  They strewed bricks
and clay on top of the roof, to keep it safe from the enemy's
fire, and threw a blanket on top of that, to keep projectiles
from seige engines from breaking through the boarding, and
stones from catapults from shattering the bricks.

9.1 Storias autem ex funibus ancorariis tres in longitudinem parietum turris
latas IIII pedes fecerunt easque ex tribus partibus,
quae ad hostes vergebant,
eminentibus trabibus circum turrim praependentes religaverunt;
quod unum genus tegimenti aliis locis erant experti nullo telo neque tormento
traici posse.
Ubi vero ea pars turris, quae erat perfecta,
tecta atque munita est ab omni ictu hostium, pluteos ad alia opera abduxerunt;
turris tectum per se ipsum pressionibus ex contignatione prima supendere ac
tollere coeperunt.
Ubi, quantum storiarum demissio patiebatur, tantum elevarant,
intra haec tegimenta abditi atque muniti parietes lateribus exstruebant
rursusque alia pressione ad aedificandum sibi locum expediebant.
Ubi tempus alterius contabulationis videbatur,
tigna item ut primo tecta extremis lateribus instruebant exque ea contignatione
rursus summam contabulationem storiasque elevabant.

Ita tuto ac sine ullo vulnere ac periculo sex tabulata exstruxerunt
fenestrasque, quibus in locis visum est,
ad tormenta mittenda in struendo reliquerunt.

But they made a matting, 4 feet thick, out of anchor ropes 
 three in length of the walls of the tower
and bound them from the three sides that faced the enemy,
with tall beams hanging down in front around the tower.
In other places this sort of covering has proven impenetrable by either
spear or catapult.
Indeed the region around the tower, when it was finished,
was roofed and fortified from any blow of the enemy.
They set up breastworks that led off to other fortifications,
and started to raise the tower's roof and to suspend it upon itself
from the first story with fulcrums.
As soon as they let as much matting down as they had raised up,
they constructed hidden and fortified walls on the flanks between these
coverings, and made the site ready for construction by means of another fulcrum.
When the time for whichever floor appeared,
they likewise first constructed beams the roofs on the outer sides
and and again raised the highest floor and mattings on the joists.
And so they raised six floors safely and without danger.
They included openings, through which targets were visible,
and abandoned the catapults that had been sent during the building.
