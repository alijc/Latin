9.1 Ubi turris altitudo perducta est ad contabulationem, eam
in parietes instruxerunt, ita ut capita tignorum extrema
parietum structura tegerentur, ne quid emineret, ubi ignis
hostium adhaeresceret.  Hanc super contignationem, quantum
tectum plutei ac vinearum passum est, laterculo adstruxerunt
supraque eum locum duo tigna transversa iniecerunt non longe
ab extremis parietibus, quibus suspenderent eam
contignationem, quae turri tegimento esset futura, supraque
ea tigna directo transversas trabes iniecerunt easque axibus
religaverunt (has trabes paulo longiores atque eminentiores,
quam extremi parietes erant, effecerant, ut esset ubi
tegimenta praependere possent ad defendendos ictus ac
repellendos, cum infra eam contignationem parietes
exstruerentur) eamque contabulationem summam lateribus
lutoque constraverunt, ne quid ignis hostium nocere posset,
centonesque insuper iniecerunt, ne aut tela tormentis immissa
tabulationem perfringerent, aut saxa ex catapultis latericium
discuterent.


When the height of the tower was brought up to one story,
they fitted a platform into the walls, so that the ends of
the posts were covered by the outer structure of the walls,
to keep anything from sticking out where it could catch on
fire.  On top of this platform, as far as was allowed by the
protection of their breastworks and latticework, they piled
up bricks and set two cross-beams in place, not far from the
rear of the walls.  From this they hung a platform for
protecting the tower, and set lateral beams on it and
fastened on planks.  (They made these beams a little longer
than the breadth of the walls, to project out, so that they
could hang a covering in front to defend them while the walls
under the roof were being constructed.)  They strewed bricks
and clay on top of the roof, to keep it safe from the enemy's
fire, and threw a blanket on top of that, to keep projectiles
from seige engines from breaking through the boarding, and
stones from catapults from shattering the bricks.
