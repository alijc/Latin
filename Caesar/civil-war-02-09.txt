9.1 Ubi turris altitudo perducta est ad contabulationem, eam
in parietes instruxerunt, ita ut capita tignorum extrema
parietum structura tegerentur, ne quid emineret, ubi ignis
hostium adhaeresceret.  Hanc super contignationem, quantum
tectum plutei ac vinearum passum est, laterculo adstruxerunt
supraque eum locum duo tigna transversa iniecerunt non longe
ab extremis parietibus, quibus suspenderent eam
contignationem, quae turri tegimento esset futura, supraque
ea tigna directo transversas trabes iniecerunt easque axibus
religaverunt (has trabes paulo longiores atque eminentiores,
quam extremi parietes erant, effecerant, ut esset ubi
tegimenta praependere possent ad defendendos ictus ac
repellendos, cum infra eam contignationem parietes
exstruerentur) eamque contabulationem summam lateribus
lutoque constraverunt, ne quid ignis hostium nocere posset,
centonesque insuper iniecerunt, ne aut tela tormentis immissa
tabulationem perfringerent, aut saxa ex catapultis latericium
discuterent.


When the height of the tower was brought up to one story,
they fitted a platform into the walls, so that the ends of
the posts were covered by the outer structure of the walls,
to keep anything from sticking out where it could catch on
fire.  On top of this platform, as far as was allowed by the
protection of their breastworks and latticework, they piled
up bricks and set two cross-beams in place, not far from the
rear of the walls.  From this they hung a platform for
protecting the tower, and set lateral beams on it and
fastened on planks.  (They made these beams a little longer
than the breadth of the walls, to project out, so that they
could hang a covering in front to defend them while the walls
under the roof were being constructed.)  They strewed bricks
and clay on top of the roof, to keep it safe from the enemy's
fire, and threw a blanket on top of that, to keep projectiles
from seige engines from breaking through the boarding, and
stones from catapults from shattering the bricks.

... Storias autem ex funibus ancorariis tres in longitudinem
parietum turris latas IIII pedes fecerunt easque ex tribus
partibus, quae ad hostes vergebant, eminentibus trabibus
circum turrim praependentes religaverunt; quod unum genus
tegimenti aliis locis erant experti nullo telo neque tormento
traici posse.  Ubi vero ea pars turris, quae erat perfecta,
tecta atque munita est ab omni ictu hostium, pluteos ad alia
opera abduxerunt; turris tectum per se ipsum pressionibus ex
contignatione prima supendere ac tollere coeperunt.  Ubi,
quantum storiarum demissio patiebatur, tantum elevarant,
intra haec tegimenta abditi atque muniti parietes lateribus
exstruebant rursusque alia pressione ad aedificandum sibi
locum expediebant.  Ubi tempus alterius contabulationis
videbatur, tigna item ut primo tecta extremis lateribus
instruebant exque ea contignatione rursus summam
contabulationem storiasque elevabant.  Ita tuto ac sine ullo
vulnere ac periculo sex tabulata exstruxerunt fenestrasque,
quibus in locis visum est, ad tormenta mittenda in struendo
reliquerunt.

Now they used anchor ropes to make three mats, 4 feet thick
and the same length as the walls of the tower, and hung them
from the three sides that faced the enemy, from the tall
beams that were suspended in front of the tower.  In other
places this sort of covering has proven impenetrable by
either spear or catapult.  Indeed, when this part of the
tower was finished, roofed over and fortified from any blow
of the enemy, they took the breastworks away to other
fortifications, and commenced to raise the tower's roof, in
one piece, from the first story, using fulcrums.  After
they'd hung mats to cover the new height of the roof, they
constructed hidden and fortified walls on the sides between
these coverings, and made the site ready for construction by
means of another fulcrum.  Whenever another floor was built
up, they again first constructed covered beams on the outer
sides and then raised the next floor and mats on the joists.
And so they raised six floors safely and without danger.
They included openings, through which targets were visible,
and at these left the catapults that had been sent in during
the building.
