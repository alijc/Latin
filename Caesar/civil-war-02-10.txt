10.1

Ubi ex ea turri, quae circum essent opera,
tueri se posse confisi sunt,
musculum pedes LX longum ex materia bipedali,
quem a turri latericia ad hostium turrim murumque perducerent,
facere instituerunt;
cuius musculi haec erat forma.
Duae primum trabes in solo aeque longae distantes inter se pedes IIII
collocantur,
inque eis columellae pedum in altitudinem V defiguntur.

Has inter se capreolis molli fastigio coniungunt, ubi tigna,
quae musculi tegendi causa ponant, collocentur.

Eo super tigna bipedalia iniciunt eaque laminis clavisque religant.

Ad extremum musculi tectum trabesque extremas quadratas regulas IIII patentes
digitos defigunt,
quae lateres, qui super musculo struantur, contineant.

Ita fastigato atque ordinatim structo,
ut trabes erant in capreolis collocatae,
lateribus lutoque musculus,
ut ab igni, qui ex muro iaceretur,
tutus esset, contegitur.

Super lateres coria inducuntur,
ne canalibus aqua immissa lateres diluere posset.

Coria autem, ne rursus igni ac lapidibus corrumpantur, centonibus conteguntur.

Hoc opus omne tectum vineis ad ipsam turrim perficiunt subitoque inopinantibus
 hostibus machinatione navali,
 phalangis subiectis, ad turrim hostium admovent, ut aedificio iungatur.


When they were confident that the tower,

which might be around the fortifications,

would enable them to protect themselves they commenced to build
a mantle 60 feet long out of wood two feet thick, that they'd be able to conduct
from the brick tower to the enemy's tower and wall.
The mantle was of this form:
They first set two beams longways on the ground, 4 feet apart,
and then fastened 5 foot tall stanchions on them.
They joined these together with rafters in a flexible roof,
where they positioned the posts that they'd placed for the sake of
covering the mantle.
They laid this on the two-feet thick beams 
and bound it fast with plates and rivets.

to the outer cover of the mantle and the 4 external rectangular faces
they fastened extended fingers,
on which they might secure the the bricks that were constructed on the mantle.

So, having been constructed symmetrically and with a peak,
as the beams had been were put together as rafters,
the mantle was covered with bricks and clay
so that it'd be protected from any fire hurled from the wall.
They introduced leather onto the bricks,
to keep water from seeping in through channels to wear the bricks away.
But the leather, to keep it from being damaged again by fire and stones,
was covered with a quilt.

this work each covering with vines/bowers to the same tower they completed
and suddenly with/to unawares enemy by an naval engine of war,
by phalanxes/rollers thrown under, to the tower of the enemy they brought up,
to connect to the structure.
