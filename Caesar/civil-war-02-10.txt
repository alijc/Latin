10.1 Ubi ex ea turri, quae circum essent opera, tueri se posse
confisi sunt, musculum pedes LX longum ex materia bipedali, quem a
turri latericia ad hostium turrim murumque perducerent, facere
instituerunt; cuius musculi haec erat forma.  Duae primum trabes in
solo aeque longae distantes inter se pedes IIII collocantur, inque
eis columellae pedum in altitudinem V defiguntur.  Has inter se
capreolis molli fastigio coniungunt, ubi tigna, quae musculi tegendi
causa ponant, collocentur.  Eo super tigna bipedalia iniciunt eaque
laminis clavisque religant.  Ad extremum musculi tectum trabesque
extremas quadratas regulas IIII patentes digitos defigunt, quae
lateres, qui super musculo struantur, contineant.  Ita fastigato
atque ordinatim structo, ut trabes erant in capreolis collocatae,
lateribus lutoque musculus, ut ab igni, qui ex muro iaceretur, tutus
esset, contegitur.  Super lateres coria inducuntur, ne canalibus
aqua immissa lateres diluere posset.  Coria autem, ne rursus igni ac
lapidibus corrumpantur, centonibus conteguntur.  Hoc opus omne
tectum vineis ad ipsam turrim perficiunt subitoque inopinantibus
hostibus machinatione navali, phalangis subiectis, ad turrim hostium
admovent, ut aedificio iungatur.


When they were confident that the tower would enable them to protect
the fortifications around it, they commenced to build a mantle 60
feet long out of wood two feet thick, that they could extend from
the brick tower to the enemy's tower and wall.  The mantle was of
this form: They first set two beams longways on the ground, 4 feet
apart, and then fastened 5 foot tall stanchions on them.  They
joined these together with rafters in a flexible roof, where they
positioned the posts placed to cover the mantle.  On this they laid
two-feet thick beams and bound them fast with plates and nails.  To
the outer cover of the mantle they fastened bars, 4 inches square,
that they used to secure the bricks arranged on the mantle.  So,
having been constructed symmetrically and with a peak, as the beams
had been constructed as rafters, the mantle was covered with bricks
and clay so that it'd be protected from any fire hurled from the
wall.  They covered the bricks with leather, to keep water from
seeping in through channels to wear the bricks away.  But the
leather, to prevent damage from fire and stones, was covered with
matting.  They completed all this work under cover of a shelter at
the base of the tower and then, with the enemy caught unawares,
quickly used ships' rollers to bring it up to their tower and joined
it to that structure.
