11.1 Quo malo perterriti subito oppidani saxa quam maxima possunt
vectibus promovent praecipitataque muro in musculum devolvunt.  Ictum
firmitas materiae sustinet, et quicquid incidit fastigio musculi
elabitur.  Id ubi vident, mutant consilium: cupas taeda ac pice refertas
incendunt easque de muro in musculum devolvunt.  Involutae labuntur,
delapsae ab lateribus longuriis furcisque ab opere removentur.  Interim
sub musculo milites vectibus infima saxa turris hostium, quibus
fundamenta continebantur, convellunt.  Musculus ex turri latericia a
nostris telis tormentisque defenditur; hostes ex muro ac turibus
submoventur: non datur libera muri defendendi facultas.  Compluribus iam
lapidibus ex ea, quae suberat, turri subductis repentina ruina pars eius
turris concidit, pars reliqua consequens procumbebat: cum hostes urbis
direptione perterriti inermes cum infulis se porta foras universi
proripiunt ad legatos atque exercitum supplices manus tendunt.


The townspeople, thoroughly frightened by this calamity, levered forward
stones, as big as they possibly could handle, and tumbled them down from
the wall onto the mantle.  But the wood was strong enough to sustain the
blows, and whatever fell onto the peak of the mantle slipped off.  When
they saw this, they changed their plan: they ignited barrels stuffed with
pitch and pine torches and dropped them down onto the mantle.  These
rolled down onto the mantle and then off the peak, fell off the sides and
were pushed away from the mantle with long-handled forks.  Meanwhile the
soldiers under the mantle were using long poles to pull off the lowermost
stones (the ones secured to the foundation) of the enemy tower. The
mantle was defended by missles catapulted from our brick tower; the enemy
was driven off of their own wall and towers: the unimpeded means for
defending the walls was not allowed them. With many stones already pulled
out from the underside of the tower, part of the tower fell down in a
sudden collapse, with the remaining portion left leaning. The enemy was
in terror of the city being pillaged, so everyone, unarmed and wearing
headbands, rushed out of the gate to the envoys and army, stretching
their hands out in supplication.
