13.1 Quibus rebus commoti legati milites ex opere deducunt,
oppugnatione desistunt; operibus custodias relinquunt.  Indutiarum
quodam genere misericordia facto adventus Caesaris exspectatur.
Nullum ex muro, nullum a nostris mittitur telum; ut re confecta
omnes curam et diligentiam remittunt.  Caesar enim per litteras
Trebonio magnopere mandaverat, ne per vim oppidum expugnari
pateretur, ne gravius permoti milites et defectionis odio et
contemptione sui et diutino labore omnes puberes interficerent;
quod se facturos minabantur, aegreque tunc sunt retenti, quin
oppidum irrumperent, graviterque eam rem tulerunt, quod stetisse
per Trebonium, quominus oppido potirentur, videbatur.

The legates, moved by these things, withdrew the soldiers from the
fortifications and halted the attack, leaving guards posted.  With
a certain sort of truce having been accomplished by means of
compassion, they awaited the arrival of Caesar.  Not a spear was
cast, either by us or from the wall; as the business was finished,
everyone relaxed their care and attentiveness.  For Caesar had
expressly commanded, in a letter to Trebonius, that the town would
not be permitted to be stormed by force, lest the soldiers, deeply
roused by a hatred of failure and their scorn and long labor, kill
the young men.  It seemed that they themselves had threatened
these actions, and had then been barely held back to keep them
from rushing into the town, and they bore the matter deeply to
have stood at Trebonius' account, that they could not possess the
town.
