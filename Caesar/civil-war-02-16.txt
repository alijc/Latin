16.1 Quod ubi hostes viderunt, ea, quae vix longinquo spatio refici
non posse sperassent, paucorum dierum opera et labore ita refecta,
ut nullus perfidiae neque eruptioni locus esset nec quicquam omnino
relinqueretur, qua aut telis militibus aut igni operibus noceri
posset, eodemque exemplo sentiunt totam urbem, qua sit aditus ab
terra, muro turribusque circumiri posse, sic ut ipsis consistendi
in suis munitionibus locus non esset, cum paene inaedificata muris
ab exercitu nostro moenia viderentur ac telum manu coniceretur,
suorumque tormentorum usum, quibus ipsi magna speravissent, spatio
propinquitatis interire parique condicione ex muro ac turribus
bellandi data se virtute nostris adaequare non posse intellegunt,
ad easdem deditionis condiciones recurrunt.

The enemy saw that within a few days we had rebuilt, with such
effort and exertion, what they had hoped couldn't possibly be
rebuilt for a very long time, so that there was no occasion for
their treachery or sallying out, and that no way at all was left
to harm the soldiers with darts or the fortifications with fire.
In the same way they perceived that the whole city, where it had
access from land, could be surrounded by a wall and towers, so
that there wouldn't be a way for them to make a stand within
their fortifications, when they saw that the ramparts that our
army had nearly finished building would allow spears to be cast
into their walls.  They'd put great hope in their catapults, but
realized that the close proximity rendered them useless, and
that, given the condition of the wall and towers for fighting,
they could not come up to the level of our men in strength.  And
so they turned back to conditions for their surrender.
