23.1 Eisdem temporibus C. Curio in Africam profectus ex Sicilia et
iam ab initio copias P. Attii Vari despiciens duas legiones ex
IIII, quas a Caesare acceperat, D equites transportabat biduoque
et noctibus tribus navigatione consumptis appellit ad eum locum,
qui appellatur Anquillaria.  Hic locus abest a Clupeis passuum
XXII milia habetque non incommodam aestate stationem et duobus
eminentibus promuntoriis continetur.  Huius adventum L. Caesar
filius cum X longis navibus ad Clupea praestolans, quas naves
Uticae ex praedonum bello subductas P. Attius reficiendas huius
belli causa curaverat, veritus navium multitudinem ex alto
refugerat appulsaque ad proximum litus trireme constrata et in
litore relicta pedibus Adrumetum perfugerat.  Id oppidum
C. Considius Longus unius legionis praesidio tuebatur.  Reliquae
Caesaris naves <cognita> eius fuga se Adrumetum receperunt.  Hunc
secutus Marcius Rufus quaestor navibus XII, quas praesidio
onerariis navibus Curio ex Sicilia eduxerat, postquam in litore
relictam navem conspexit, hanc remulco abstraxit; ipse ad
C. Curionem cum classe redit.


In the meantime, C. Curio had advanced from Sicily to Africa and,
from the outset thinking little of P. Attius Varius' troops, was
transporting 500 horsemen and two of the 4 legions that he'd
received from Caesar.  After spending two days and three nights in
the voyage he put ashore at the place called Anquillaria.  This
place is 12 miles away from Clupeis and contains an outpost that's
not too bad in the summer and is protected by two prominent
headlands.  A son, L. Caesar, was awaiting his arrival with with
at Clupea 10 galleys that P. Attius had transferred these ships
from the war on the pirates and had undertaken their repair at
Utica to be used in this war.  Fearing thus multitude of ships, he
had fled from the sea and put in at the nearest shore in a decked
trieme, which he abandoned on the shore and took refuge in
Adrumetus on foot.  C. Considius Longus defended this town with a
garrison of a single legion.  When they found out about this
flight, the rest of Caesar's ships betook themselves to Adrumetus.
Questor Marcius Rufus followed him with 12 ships that Curio had
ordered out to sea from Sicily to protect the transports.  After
he spied ship abandoned on the shore, he pulled it off with a
tow-rope; he returned to C. Curio with the fleet.
