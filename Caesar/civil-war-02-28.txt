28.1 Erat in exercitu Vari Sextus Quintilius Varus, quem
fuisse Corfinii supra demonstratum est.  Hic dimissus a
Caesare in Africam venerat, legionesque eas traduxerat
Curio, quas superioribus temporibus Corfinio receperat
Caesar, adeo ut paucis mutatis centurionibus eidem ordines
manipulique constarent.  Hanc nactus appellationis causam
Quintilius circumire aciem Curionis atque obsecrare milites
coepit, ne primam sacramenti, quod apud Domitium atque apud
se quaestorem dixissent, memoriam deponerent, neu contra eos
arma ferrent, qui eadem essent usi fortuna eademque in
obsidione perpessi, neu pro his pugnarent, a quibus cum
contumelia perfugae appellarentur.  Huc pauca ad spem
largitionis addidit, quae ab sua liberalitate, si se atque
Attium secuti essent, exspectare deberent.  Hac habita
oratione nullam in partem ab exercitu Curionis fit
significatio, atque ita suas uterque copias reducit.


In Varus' army was Sextus Quintilius Varus, whom we have
previously described to have been of Corfinium.  After
Caesar released him, and he had come to Africa, and Curio
had brought the legions that Caesar had recently regained at
Corfinium, so that the companies and platoons remained
virtually the same, with only small changes of centurions.
Quintilius, armed with this reason for addressing them,
commenced to go round Curio's battle line and to entreat the
soldiers, to not forget their first oath of allegiance, that
they'd sworn before Domitius and himself, as his quaestor,
nor to bear arms against those who were once served by
fortune and had now suffered in the seige, nor to fight for
these men, who had slandered them as deserters.  To this he
added a few words towards the hope of largess, that they
could expect due to his own generosity, if they would follow
Attius and himself.  But after he finished his speech,
Curio's army gave no sign, and so both armies were led back
to their camps.
