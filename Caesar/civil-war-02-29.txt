29.1 At in castris Curionis magnus omnium incessit timor animis.
Is variis hominum sermonibus celeriter augetur.  Unusquisque enim
opiniones fingebat et ad id, quod ab alio audierat, sui aliquid
timoris addebat.  Hoc ubi uno auctore ad plures permanaverat, atque
alius alii tradiderat, plures auctores eius rei videbantur.
[Civile bellum; genus hominum; cui liceret libere facere et sequi
quod vellet; legiones eae, quae paulo ante apud adversarios
fuerant; nam etiam Caesaris beneficium mutaverat consuetudo qua
offerrentur; municipia etiam diversis partibus coniuncta, namque ex
Marsis Pelignisque veniebant, ut qui superiore nocte in
contuberniis commilitesque; nonnulli graviora; sermones militum;
dubia durius accipiebantur, nonnulla etiam ab eis, qui
diligentiores videri volebant, fingebantur.]


But in Curio's camp a great panic assailed everyone's courage,
spreading rapidly by word of mouth.  For each man formed his own
opinions, and whatever he heard from another man he added some of
his own fear to it.  And after one man passed it on to more, and
they related it to others, there seemed to be more authorities
about the business.  [It's a civil war; one may freely pick
whichever side he wishes; those legions, that had recently been
among the enemy; for their experience, as it seemed, had yet
altered Caesar's favors; yet the towns, connected in their separate
regions, for indeed they were coming from Marsus and Pelignis, as
those comrades who the previous night, among their mess-mates;
several of the weightier rumors of the soldiers; they were harshly
seized with doubt, and yet a few of them, who wished to seem more
diligent, were shaped.]
