31.1 Curio utrumque improbans consilium, quantum alteri sententiae
deesset animi, tantum alteri superesse dicebat: hos turpissimae fugae
rationem habere, illos etiam iniquo loco dimicandum putare.  "Qua enim,"
inquit, "fiducia et opere et natura loci munitissima castra expugnari
posse confidimus?  Aut vero quid proficimus, si accepto magno detrimento
ab oppugnatione castrorum discedimus?  Quasi non et felicitas rerum
gestarum exercitus benevolentiam imperatoribus et res adversae odia
colligant!  Castrorum autem mutatio quid habet nisi turpem fugam et
desperationem omnium et alienationem exercitus?  Nam neque pudentes
suspicari oportet sibi parum credi, neque improbos scire sese timeri,
quod his licentiam timor augeat noster, illis studia deminuat."  "Quod
si iam," inquit, "haec explorata habeamus, quae de exercitus alienatione
dicuntur, quae quidem ego aut omnino falsa aut certe minora opinione
esse confido, quanto haec dissimulari et occultari, quam per nos
confirmari praestet?  An non, uti corporis vulnera, ita exercitus
incommoda sunt tegenda, ne spem adversariis augeamus?  At etiam, ut
media nocte proficiscamur, addunt, quo maiorem, credo, licentiam
habeant, qui peccare conentur.  Namque huiusmodi res aut pudore aut metu
tenentur; quibus rebus nox maxime adversaria est.  Quare neque tanti sum
animi, ut sine spe castra oppugnanda censeam, neque tanti timoris, uti
spe deficiam, atque omnia prius experienda arbitror magnaque ex parte
iam me una vobiscum de re iudicium facturum confido."


Curio rejected the advice of both sides, as the first opinion was
lacking in courage, while the other was too over the top.  He thought
the first would force a battle from a an unfavorable position, while the
second would be reckoned as a disgraceful flight.  "For," he said, "with
what assurance can we rely on assaulting a camp defended by both
fortifications and nature?  Or what have we really accomplished, if we
retreat from the camp after suffering a major defeat?  Doesn't good
fortune in war win the good-will of an army toward its generals, while
misfortune gains their hated?  Wouldn't breaking camp be held as nothing
but shameful flight, the desperation of every man and the alienation of
the army?  For it's good to neither let shamed men suspect that they are
little trusted, nor wicked men know that they are feared, because our
fear lessens the courage of the former, and adds to the presumption of
the latter.  "Because if we still hold," he said, "to what we have
investigated, what is said about the alienation of the army, which
indeed I hold to be either an outright lie or at least a minority
opinion, wouldn't it be better for these matters to be concealed and
hidden, than to be confirmed by us?  Or else, like wounds of the body,
so shouldn't the army's troubles be concealed to keep from raising the
enemy's hopes?  And yet, decamping in the middle of the night, he added,
would, I believe, give a greater boldness for those who would take their
chance to go awry.  For whenever things are kept in check by either
shame or fear; the night is especially hostile to these matters.
Therefor I am neither of such a mind, that I think the camp without hope
in the case of an attack, nor of such fear that I have lost all hope,
and I believe, based on all my prior experience, and I still trust my
judgment on the future for the most part."
