34.1 Erat vallis inter duas acies, ut supra demonstratum est, non
ita magna, at difficili et arduo ascensu.  Hanc uterque, si
adversariorum copiae transire conarentur, exspectabat, quo
aequiore loco proelium committeret.  Simul ab sinistro cornu
P. Attii equitatus omnis et una levis armaturae interiecti
complures, cum se in vallem demitterent, cernebantur.  Ad eos
Curio equitatum et duas Marrucinorum cohortes mittit; quorum
primum impetum equites hostium non tulerunt, sed admissis equis
ad suos refugerunt; relicti ab his, qui una procurrerant levis
armaturae, circumveniebantur atque interficiebantur ab nostris.
Huc tota Vari conversa acies suos fugere et concidi videbat.
Tunc Rebilus, legatus Caesaris, quem Curio secum ex Sicilia
duxerat, quod magnum habere usum in re militari sciebat,
"perterritum," inquit, "hostem vides, Curio: quid dubitas uti
temporis opportunitate?"  Ille unum elocutus, ut memoria tenerent
milites ea, quae pridie sibi confirmassent, sequi sese iubet et
praecurrit ante omnes.  Adeo erat impedita vallis, ut in ascensu
nisi sublevati a suis primi non facile eniterentur.  Sed
praeoccupatus animus Attianorum militum timore et fuga et caede
suorum nihil de resistendo cogitabat, omnesque se iam ab equitatu
circumveniri arbitrabantur.  Itaque priusquam telum abici posset,
aut nostri propius accederent, omnis Vari acies terga vertit
seque in castra recepit.


There was a valley between the two lines, as was mentioned above,
not very large, but a difficult and steep ascent.  Each general
waited to see if the enemy troops would try to cross it, which
would allow him to engage battle on even ground.  At once they
perceived that all of P. Attius' cavalry, along with some of his
lightly armed infantry, had descended into the valley that lay
between them.  Curio sent his cavalry and two Marrucian cohorts
against them.  The enemy's horse didn't withstand their initial
assault, but spurred their horses and fled to their own lines.
The lightly armed infantry that had advanced, thus abandoned,
were encircled and destroyed by our men.  At this point Varius'
entire line saw their men were fleeing and being cut down.  Then
Rebilus, Caesar's deputy, whom Curio had brought with him from
Sicily, knew what great experience he had in military matters,
said, "You see that the enemy is terrified, Curio.  Why do you
hesitate to use the advantage of the moment?"  Curio spoke only
to remind the soldiers of what they'd declared on the previous
day.  He then ordered them to follow him and ran out in front of
them all.  The valley was obstructed so badly that it was hard
for the first men to climb up, unless they were boosted up by
their comrades.  But the heart of the Attianian soldiers, seized
with fear and the flight and slaughter of their men, thought
nothing about resisting, and everyone now imagined that they were
encircled by the cavalry.  And so, before a spear could be thrown
or our men approached any nearer, Varus' whole line turned tail
and retreated to camp.
