35.1 Qua in fuga Fabius Pelignus quidam ex infimis ordinibus de exercitu
Curionis primus agmen fugientium consecutus magna voce Varum nomine
appellans requirebat, uti unus esse ex eius militibus et monere aliquid
velle ac dicere videretur.  Ubi ille saepius appellatus aspexit ac
restitit et, quis esset aut quid vellet, quaesivit, umerum apertum gladio
appetit paulumque afuit, quin Varum interficeret; quod ille periculum
sublato ad eius conatum scuto vitavit.  Fabius a proximis militibus
circumventus interficitur.  Hac fugientium multitudine ac turba portae
castrorum occupantur atque iter impeditur, pluresque in eo loco sine
vulnere quam in proelio aut fuga intereunt, neque multum afuit, quin etiam
castris expellerentur, ac nonnulli protinus eodem cursu in oppidum
contenderunt.  Sed cum loci natura et munitio castrorum aditum
prohibebant, tum quod ad proelium egressi Curionis milites eis rebus
indigebant, quae ad oppugnationem castrorum erant usui.  Itaque Curio
exercitum in castra reducit suis omnibus praeter Fabium incolumibus, ex
numero adversariorum circiter DC interfectis ac mille vulneratis; qui
omnes discessu Curionis multique praeterea per simulationem vulnerum ex
castris in oppidum propter timorem sese recipiunt.  Qua re animadversa
Varus et terrore exercitus cognito bucinatore in castris et paucis ad
speciem tabernaculis relictis de tertia vigilia silentio exercitum in
oppidum reducit.



During this flight Fabius Pelignus, a soldier from the lowest rank of
Curio's army, was the first to pursue the column of fleeing men and
sought out Varus, calling him by name in a loud voice, so that he
appeared to be one of his soldiers who wanted to speak to him and
warn him about something. When Varus had been called many times he
stopped to look and asked who it was and what he wanted, and Fabius
struck at his exposed shoulder with his sword, and nearly killed him,
but he avoided the danger by raising his shield to ward off the blow.
Then Fabius was encircled by the nearest soldiers and killed.
The gates of the camp were occuppied and the road obstructed by
this mass and crowd of fleeing men and more were lost here, without a
wound, than in the battle or the flight, and it was a close thing that
they weren't forced out of the camp. Not a few straightway made a mad
dash into town.  But the nature of the place and the camp's defenses
hindered access, and Curio's soldiers, had marched out for battle,
lacking what they needed for a siege, of the things of use for
assaulting a camp.  And so Curio led the army back to camp, with no
injuries save for Fabius.  About 600 of the enemy had been killed, and a
thousand injured.  After Curio's withdrawal, all of the wounded got
themselves out of camp and into town.  And many others, out of fear, did
the same, using made-up injuries as a pretense.  Varus noticed this, and
learned of the panic of the army.  He left his trumpeter and a few tents
in camp for appearances sake and in the third watch secretly led his army
back into town.
