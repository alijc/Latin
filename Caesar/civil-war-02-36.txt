36.1 Postero die Curio obsidere Uticam et vallo circummunire instituit.
Erat in oppido multitudo insolens belli diuturnitate otii, Uticenses
pro quibusdam Caesaris in se beneficiis illi amicissimi, conventus is
qui ex variis generibus constaret, terror ex superioribus proeliis
magnus.  Itaque de deditione omnes palam loquebantur et cum P. Attio
agebant, ne sua pertinacia omnium fortunas perturbari vellet.  Haec cum
agerentur, nuntii praemissi ab rege Iuba venerunt, qui illum adesse cum
magnis copiis dicerent et de custodia ac defensione urbis hortarentur.
Quae res eorum perterritos animos confirmavit.


On the following day Curio set about besieging Utica and surrounding it
with a palisade.  There were many in the town who were unused to war
because there hadn't been one for a long time.  The Uticians were very
loyal to Caesar, due to his favors towards them.  The town's assembly
was made up of different sorts of people, and the panic from the
previous battles was great.  And so all were talking about and urging
surrender to P. Attius, so that, by his own obstanacy, he not allow the
fortunes of them all to be thrown into confusion.  While they were so
urging him, the messengers that King Juba had sent ahead arrived, to
say that he was nearby with a great number of troops, and to encourage
the protection and defense of the city.  And this matter enboldened
their terrified souls.
