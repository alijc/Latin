40.1 Iuba certior factus a Saburra de nocturno proelio II milia
Hispanorum et Gallorum equitum, quos suae custodiae causa circum
se habere consuerat, et peditum eam partem, cui maxime
confidebat, Saburrae submisit; ipse cum reliquis copiis
elephantisque LX lentius subsequitur.  Suspicatus praemissis
equitibus ipsum affore Curionem Saburra copias equitum
peditumque instruit atque his imperat, ut simulatione timoris
paulatim cedant ac pedem referant: sese, cum opus esset, signum
proelii daturum et, quod rem postulare cognovisset, imperaturum.
Curio ad superiorem spem addita praesentis temporis opinione
hostes fugere arbitratus copias ex locis superioribus in campum
deducit.


After Saburra had informed him more fully about the
night-battle, Juba dispatched the two thousand Spanish and
French horse that he habitually kept around him for protection,
along with that part of the infantry that he thought the most
reliable.  He himself was following more slowly with the rest of
the troops and 60 elephants.  Saburra, suspecting that Curio was
nearby and had sent his cavalry ahead, drew up his forces of
horse and foot and ordered them to withdraw and retreat, little
by little, under a semblance of fear: He himself, when the time
came, would give the signal for battle and would command
whatever he saw that the matter demanded.  Curio, more hopefully
holding to a greater belief for a propitious time that the enemy
would flee, drew his troops down from their higher positions
onto the plain.
