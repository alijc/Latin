43.1 His rebus cognitis Marcius Rufus quaestor in castris relictus a
Curione cohortatur suos, ne animo deficiant.  Illi orant atque
obsecrant, ut in Siciliam navibus reportentur.  Pollicetur magistrisque
imperat navium, ut primo vespere omnes scaphas ad litus appulsas
habeant.  Sed tantus fuit omnium terror, ut alii adesse copias Iubae
dicerent, alii cum legionibus instare Varum iamque se pulverem
venientium cernere, quarum rerum nihil omnino acciderat, alii classem
hostium celeriter advolaturam suspicarentur.  Itaque perterritis omnibus
sibi quisque consulebat.  Qui in classe erant, proficisci properabant.
Horum fuga navium onerariarum magistros incitabat; pauci lenunculi ad
officium imperiumque conveniebant.  Sed tanta erat completis litoribus
contentio, qui potissimum ex magno numero conscenderent, ut multitudine
atque onere nonnulli deprimerentur, reliqui hoc timore propius adire
tardarentur.


When the quaestor Marcius Rufus, whom Curio had left in the camp,
learned of these matters, he admonished his men to not lose heart.  They
begged and entreated him to let them sail back to Sicily.  Their
commander promised this and commanded all of the ships' boats to be
brought to shore by nightfall.  But the general panic was so great that
some men said that Juba's troops were near at hand, while others thought
that Varus and his legions were now threatening them, and that they
could make out the dust of their approach, and still others supposed
that the enemy fleet was speeding towards them.  And so, with everyone
in a panic, each man looked out for himself, and those who were on board
made haste to depart.  The flight of these transports set the other
ship's masters in motion, and few skiffs assembled for the commanded
service.  But such was the scramble along whole shore and so many
clambered aboard them, that a some were overloaded and sank, and the
rest were held off-shore for fear of this happening to them.
