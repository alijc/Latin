44.1 Quibus rebus accidit, ut pauci milites patresque familiae,
qui aut gratia aut misericordia valerent aut naves adnare possent,
recepti in Siciliam incolumes pervenirent.  Reliquae copiae missis
ad Varum noctu legatorum numero centurionibus sese ei dediderunt.
Quarum cohortium milites postero die ante oppidum Iuba conspicatus
suam esse praedicans praedam magnam partem eorum interfici iussit,
paucos electos in regnum remisit, cum Varus suam fidem ab eo laedi
quereretur neque resistere auderet.  Ipse equo in oppidum vectus
prosequentibus compluribus senatoribus, quo in numero erat
Ser. Sulpicius et Licinius Damasippus paucis diebus quae fieri
vellet, Uticae constituit atque imperavit diebusque post paucis se
in regnum cum omnibus copiis recepit.


From this it came about that only a few soldiers and heads of
household, those who had prevailed through either friendship or
pity, or were able to swim to the ships, reached Sicily.  The rest
of the troops surrendered to Varus, after a number of officers and
centurions treated with him overnight.  When, on the next day Juba
inspected the soldiers of these cohorts before the town, he
declared that they were his spoils of war and ordered most of them
to be killed, sending only a few selected men back to his kingdom.
Varus grumbled that his own credibility was injured by this, but
dared not oppose him.  The king rode into town, escorted by many
senators, two of whom were Servius Sulpicius and Licinius
Damasippus.  During the next few days he settled and commanded
what he wanted to be done in Utica and then withdrew to his
kingdom with all his forces.
