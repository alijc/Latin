1.1 Dictatore habente comitia Caesare consules creantur Iulius
Caesar et P. Servilius: is enim erat annus, quo per leges ei
consulem fieri liceret.  His rebus confectis, cum fides tota
Italia esset angustior neque creditae pecuniae solverentur,
constituit, ut arbitri darentur; per eos fierent aestimationes
possessionum et rerum, quanti quaeque earum ante bellum fuisset,
atque eae creditoribus traderentur.  Hoc et ad timorem novarum
tabularum tollendum minuendumve, qui fere bella et civiles
dissensiones sequi consuevit, et ad debitorum tuendam
existimationem esse aptissimum existimavit.  Itemque praetoribus
tribunisque plebis rogationes ad populum ferentibus nonnullos
ambitus Pompeia lege damnatos illis temporibus, quibus in urbe
praesidia legionum Pompeius habuerat, quae iudicia aliis
audientibus iudicibus, aliis sententiam ferentibus singulis
diebus erant perfecta, in integrum restituit, qui se illi initio
civilis belli obtulerant, si sua opera in bello uti vellet,
proinde aestimans, ac si usus esset, quoniam sui fecissent
potestatem.  Statuerat enim prius hos iudicio populi debere
restitui, quam suo beneficio videri receptos, ne aut ingratus in
referenda gratia aut arrogans in praeripiendo populi beneficio
videretur.


The dictator Caesar held an assembly, and Julius Caesar and
P. Servilius were appointed as consuls; for it was the year in
which it was permitted by law for him to become a consul.  After
these matters were accomplished, since credit was constricted
all over Italy and loans were not being repaid, he established
for arbitors to be enrolled; through these the valuations of
possessions and property could be made of however much they had
cost before the war, and for this to be handed over to their
creditors.  He reckoned that this was the best course of action,
in respect to a fear of new contracts that might be eliminated
or reduced and in regards to an examined estimation of debtors,
as was accustomed to closely follow wars and civil
disagreements, Moreover, by request of the plebs to the people,
he pardoned the praetors and tribunes who had been convicted of
bribery under Pompey's law in those times in which Pompey had
held a garrison of legions in the city, with the trials being
heard by some judges while other judges pronounced sentences on
the day they were completed.  These men had offered themselves
at the onset of the civil war, if he wished to make use of their
service in the war, then assessing, and if he had made use of
them, since his men had given him power.  For he had already
determined that it should seem that these men were restored by
the judgment of the people rather than to accept his own
kindness, lest he seem either ungrateful in rendering favor or
arrogant in snatching the people's benefit away.
