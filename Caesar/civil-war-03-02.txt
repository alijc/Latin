2.1 His rebus et feriis Latinis comitiisque omnibus perficiendis XI dies
tribuit dictaturaque se abdicat et ab urbe proficiscitur Brundisiumque
pervenit.  Eo legiones XII, equitatum omnem venire iusserat.  Sed tantum
navium repperit, ut anguste XV milia legionariorum militum, DC equites
transportari possent.  Hoc unum Caesari ad celeritatem conficiendi belli
defuit.  Atque hae ipsae copiae hoc infrequentiores imponuntur, quod
multi Gallicis tot bellis defecerant, longumque iter ex Hispania magnum
numerum deminuerat, et gravis autumnus in Apulia circumque Brundisium ex
saluberrimis Galliae et Hispaniae regionibus omnem exercitum valetudine
temptaverat.


He used up 11 days carrying out these events, and the Latin holidays, and
the elections, and then resigned from the dictatorship, left
the city and went to Brundisium.  He had ordered 12 legions and all of
the cavalry to come there.  But he found only enough ships to
transport scarcely 15 thousand legionary soldiers and 600
horses.  This was the only thing that kept Caesar from quickly preparing
for war.  And these same troops were under-manned, because they'd lost so
many men in the Gallic wars, and the long march from Spain had weakened a
great number of them, and the harsh autumn weather in Apulia and around
Brundisium tried the soundness of the whole army, used to the wholesome
regions of Gaul and Spain.
