3.1 Pompeius annuum spatium ad comparandas copias nactus, quod vacuum
a bello atque ab hoste otiosum fuerat, magnam ex Asia Cycladibusque
insulis, Corcyra, Athenis, Ponto, Bithynia, Syria, Cilicia, Phoenice,
Aegypto classem coegerat, magnam omnibus locis aedificandam curaverat;
magnam imperatam Asiae, Syriae regibusque omnibus et dynastis et
tetrarchis et liberis Achaiae populis pecuniam exegerat, magnam
societates earum provinciarum, quas ipse obtinebat, sibi numerare
coegerat.


Pompey, having obtained the space of a year for preparing his troops,
seeing that he hadn't been busied with either a war or an enemy, had
gathered a large fleet from Asia and the Cyclades islands, Corcyra,
Athens, Pontus, Bithynia, Syria, Cilicia, Phoenicia and Egypt, and had
undertaken great construction in all these places.  He'd exacted a
great levy of money from Asia and Syria, and from all the kings and
rulers and tetrarchs and from the free populations of Achaia, and had
summoned the confederacies of the provinces that he held to pay a
large sum to him.
