appellabat; unam ex Creta et Macedonia ex veteranis militibus, qui
dimissi a superioribus imperatoribus in his provinciis consederant;
duas ex Asia, quas Lentulus consul conscribendas curaverat.  Praeterea

praeerat, excellenti virtute; D ex Gabinianis Alexandria, Gallos
Germanosque, quos ibi A. Gabinius praesidii causa apud regem
Ptolomaeum reliquerat, Pompeius filius cum classe adduxerat; DCCC ex

Huc Dardanos, Bessos partim mercenarios, partim imperio aut gratia
comparatos, item Macedones, Thessalos ac reliquarum gentium et

He ended up with 9 legions of Roman citizens: 5 that he'd brought from
Italy; a battle-tested one from Cilica, that was called Gemella, being
formed from two; one from Crete and Macedonia, made up of experienced
soldiers, who had settled in those provinces after their former
commanders disbanded them; and two from Asia, drafted by the consul
Lentulus.  In addition he distributed a great number of reinforcements
from Thessalia, Boeotia, Achaia and Epirus into the rolls of the army:
he had mixed Antony's soldiers in with these.  Besides these he was
expecting 2 legions, with Scipio, from Syria.  He had 3000 archers
from Crete, Sparta, Pontus and Syria and the other cities, 1200
cohorts of slingers, and 700 horse.  Deiotarus had added 600 Gauls
from these places, Ariobarzanes 500 from Cappadocia; Cotys had given
about the same number from Thrace and had sent his son Sadala; 200
Macedonians were led by Rhascypolis, who was distinguished in courage,
500 from Alexandria, Gauls and Germans, that A. Gabinius had left
there to protect King Ptolomy - Pompey, Jr brought all these in his
fleet; he had collected 800 of his own slaves and a number of his
herdsmen; Tarcondarius Castor and Domnilaus had provided 300 from
Galatia (of these two one had come with the troops, and the other had
sent his son); 200 had been sent from Syria by Commagenus of Antioch,
to whom Pompey conferred a large reward, most of these were mounted
archers.  Here he had added Dardanians, Bessians, partly mercenaries,
partly procured by command or by favor, and also Macedonians,
Thessalians and the rest of the tribes and cities, filled out the
number that we indicated above.
