5.1 Frumenti vim maximam ex Thessalia, Asia, Aegypto, Creta, Cyrenis
reliquisque regionibus comparaverat.  Hiemare Dyrrachii, Apolloniae
omnibusque oppidis maritimis constituerat, ut mare transire Caesarem
prohiberet, eiusque rei causa omni ora maritima classem disposuerat.
Praeerat Aegyptiis navibus Pompeius filius, Asiaticis D. Laelius et
C. Triarius, Syriacis C. Cassius, Rhodiis C. Marcellus cum C. Coponio,
Liburnicae atque Achaicae classi Scribonius Libo et M. Octavius.  Toti
tamen officio maritimo M. Bibulus praepositus cuncta administrabat; ad
hunc summa imperii respiciebat.


He had secured a huge abundance of supplies from Thessaly, Asia, Egypt,
Crete, Cyrena and the rest of the territories.  He had prepared to
winter over at Dyrrachium, Apollonia and all the other coastal towns, to
keep Caesar from crossing the sea, and for this reason he had stationed
his fleet along the sea-shore.  Pompey Jr led the Egyptians, D. Laelius
and C. Triarius the Asians, C. Cassius the Syrians, and C. Marcellus and
C. Coponius, the Rhodians, while Scribonius Libo and M. Octavius
commanded the Liburian and Archaean fleet.  But M. Bibulus, the naval
commander, directed everything to do with maritime operations; to this
end he oversaw the chief points of command.
