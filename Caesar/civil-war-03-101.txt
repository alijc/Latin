101.1 Isdem fere temporibus C. Cassius cum classe Syrorum et
Phoenicum et Cilicum in Siciliam venit, et cum esset Caesaris
classis divisa in duas partes, dimidiae parti praeesset
P. Sulpicius praetor ad Vibonem, dimidiae M. Pomponius ad
Messanam, prius Cassius ad Messanam navibus advolavit, quam
Pomponius de eius adventu cognosceret, perturbatumque eum nactus
nullis custodiis neque ordinibus certis, magno vento et secundo
completas onerarias naves taeda et pice et stuppa reliquisque
rebus, quae sunt ad incendia, in Pomponianam classem immisit atque
omnes naves incendit XXXV, e quibus erant XX constratae.
Tantusque eo facto timor incessit, ut, cum esset legio praesidio
Messanae, vix oppidum defenderetur, et nisi eo ipso tempore quidam
nuntii de Caesaris victoria per dispositos equites essent allati,
existimabant plerique futurum fuisse, uti amitteretur.
Sed opportunissime nuntiis allatis oppidum est defensum;
Cassiusque ad Sulpicianam inde classem profectus est Vibonem,
applicatisque nostris ad terram navibus pari atque antea ratione
Cassius secundum nactus ventum onerarias naves praeparatas ad
incendium immisit, et flamma ab utroque cornu comprensa naves sunt
combustae quinque.  Cumque ignis magnitudine venti latius
serperet, milites, qui ex veteribus legionibus erant relicti
praesidio navibus ex numero aegrorum, ignominiam non tulerunt, sed
sua sponte naves conscenderunt et a terra solverunt impetuque
facto in Cassianam classem quinqueremes duas, in quarum altera
erat Cassius, ceperunt; sed Cassius exceptus scapha refugit;
praeterea duae sunt depressae triremes.  Neque multo post de
proelio facto in Thessalia cognitum est, ut ipsis Pompeianis fides
fieret; nam ante id tempus fingi a legatis amicisque Caesaris
arbitrabantur.  Quibus rebus cognitis ex his locis Cassius cum
classe discessit.


At about the same time Gaius Cassius arrived at Sicily with a
fleet of Syrians, Phoenicians and Cilicians.  And since Caesar's
fleet had been divided into two parts, of which praetor
P. Sulpicius commanded half at Vibo, and M. Pomponius half at
Messana, Cassius raced to Messana by sea before Pomponius could
learn of his arrival, and finding him disorganized, with neither a
watch or established orders, and a powerful wind blowing from the
right direction, launched cargo ships, loaded with pitch and tar
and tow along with other flammable material, into Pomponius' fleet
and set all 35 ships, of which 20 were decked, on fire.  And after
this was done such dread fell upon them that, although Messana had
a legion to protect it, the town was barely defended, and until
the very last minute, when some messages about Caesar's victory
were brought by relays of riders, most people thought that they
were goners.
But after the messages came in so opportunely the town WAS
defended; and Cassius set off from there to Sulpicius' fleet at
Vibo. As our ships were tied up to shore, Cassius used the same
plan as before.  When he got a favorable wind he sent in cargo
ships set up as incendiaries and five ships caught fire from both
sides and were burnt up.  And when the fire grew more extensive,
from the magnitude of the wind, some veteran soldiers, who were
invalided out of their legions and left as a guard for the ships,
couldn't bear the disgrace, but of their own will boarded ships
and set sail and, launching an attack against Cassius' fleet,
seized two quinqueremes, including the one that Cassius was on
(but he managed to escape in a skiff).  In addition, two triemes
were sunk.  And not much later he learned of the battle that had
been fought in Thessaly, as credited by Pompey's men themselves -
for before this time he assumed that it was only imagined by
Caesar's envoys and friends.  And after he learned these things
from these places, Cassius departed, with his fleet.
