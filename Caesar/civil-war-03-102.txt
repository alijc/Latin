102.1 Caesar omnibus rebus relictis persequendum sibi Pompeium
existimavit, quascumque in partes se ex fuga recepisset, ne rursus
copias comparare alias et bellum renovare posset, et quantumcumque
itineris equitatu efficere poterat, cotidie progrediebatur
legionemque unam minoribus itineribus subsequi iussit.  Erat edictum
Pompei nomine Amphipoli propositum, uti omnes eius provinciae
iuniores, Graeci civesque Romani, iurandi causa convenirent.  Sed
utrum avertendae suspicionis causa Pompeius proposuisset, ut quam
diutissime longioris fugae consilium occultaret, an ut novis
dilectibus, si nemo premeret, Macedoniam tenere conaretur, existimari
non poterat.  Ipse ad ancoram unam noctem constitit et vocatis ad se
Amphipoli hospitibus et pecunia ad necessarios sumptus corrogata,
cognito Caesaris adventu, ex eo loco discessit et Mytilenas paucis
diebus venit.  Biduum tempestate retentus navibusque aliis additis
actuariis in Ciliciam atque inde Cyprum pervenit.  Ibi cognoscit
consensu omnium Antiochensium civiumque Romanorum, qui illic
negotiarentur, arma capta esse excludendi sui causa nuntiosque
dimissos ad eos, qui se ex fuga in finitimas civitates recepisse
dicerentur, ne Antiochiam adirent: id si fecissent, magno eorum
capitis periculo futurum.  Idem hoc L. Lentulo, qui superiore anno
consul fuerat, et P. Lentulo consulari ac nonnullis aliis acciderat
Rhodi; qui cum ex fuga Pompeium sequerentur atque in insulam
venissent, oppido ac portu recepti non erant missisque ad eos
nuntiis, ut ex his locis discederent contra voluntatem suam naves
solverant.  Iamque de Caesaris adventu fama ad civitates
perferebatur.


Caesar decided on pursuing Pompey with every opportunity left to him,
in whichever regions he might take himself in his flight, to keep him
from collecting other forces and renewing the war again.  And so he
advanced each day by however much his cavalry was able, and ordered
one legion to follow them at a slower pace.  A resolution had been
proclaimed at Amphipolus, in Pompey's name, that all draft-age men of
his province, whether Greek or Roman citizens, should assemble.  But
he couldn't judge whether Pompey proposed this to divert suspicion
and conceal his flight for as long as possible, or to attempt to
occupy Macedonia with fresh levies, if no one pursued him.  Pompey
himself lay at anchor one night and after summoning his friends in
Amphipolus and collecting money for needed expenses, he learned of
Caesar's arrival and withdrew from there and went to Mytilenae in a
few days.  After being held up for two days by a storm and with other
faster ships added to his fleet, he reached Cilicia and from there
Cyprus.  There he learned that, by general consensus, all of the
Antiochians and the Roman citizens who did business there, that the
armory had been seized in order to shut him out and that messengers
had been sent off to those who were said to have taken flight to
nearby cities, to keep them from approaching Antioch; that if they
did so, they'd be in great peril of their heads.  The same thing had
happened at Rhodes to L. Lentulus, who had been consul the previous
year, and to P. Lentulus, of consular rank, and several others.  When
these men reached the island, following Pompey in his flight, they
had not been allowed into the town and harbor, but had been sent
messages ordering them to withdraw from there.  They set sail
unwillingly, as news of Caesar's arrival was already being carried to
the cities.
