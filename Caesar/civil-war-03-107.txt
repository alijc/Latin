107.1 Quibus rebus animadversis legiones sibi alias ex Asia adduci
iussit, quas ex Pompeianis militibus confecerat.  Ipse enim
necessario etesiis tenebatur, qui navigantibus Alexandria flant
adversissimi venti.  Interim controversias regum ad populum Romanum
et ad se, quod esset consul, pertinere existimans atque eo magis
officio suo convenire, quod superiore consulatu cum patre Ptolomaeo
et lege et senatusconsulto societas erat facta, ostendit sibi
placere regem Ptolomaeum atque eius sororem Cleopatram exercitus,
quos haberent, dimittere et de controversiis iure apud se potius
quam inter se armis disceptare.

After Caesar observed this, he ordered more legions, assembled from
Pompey's former soldiers, to be brought to him from Asia.  For he
himself was unavoidably detained by the Etesians, winds that blow
the wrong way for those sailing away from Alexandria.  Meanwhile,
thinking that the monarchs' quarrels were of concern for the Roman
people and for himself, as consul, and that it was more suitable for
his office, because an alliance with Ptolomy Sr, by the law and
decree of the Senate, had been made in his last consulship, he was
pleased to point out to King Ptolomy and his sister Cleopatra that
it would be better to disband the armies that they held and
arbitrate the dispute before him by law rather than among themselves
under arms.
