108.1 Erat in procuratione regni propter aetatem pueri nutricius
eius, eunuchus nomine Pothinus.  Is primum inter suos queri
atque indignari coepit regem ad causam dicendam evocari; deinde
adiutores quosdam consilii sui nactus ex regis amicis exercitum
a Pelusio clam Alexandriam evocavit atque eundem Achillam, cuius
supra meminimus, omnibus copiis praefecit.  Hunc incitatum suis
et regis inflatum pollicitationibus, quae fieri vellet, litteris
nuntiisque edocuit.  In testamento Ptolomaei patris heredes
erant scripti ex duobus filiis maior et ex duabus filiabus ea,
quae aetate antecedebat.  Haec uti fierent, per omnes deos
perque foedera, quae Romae fecisset, eodem testamento Ptolomaeus
populum Romanum obtestabatur.  Tabulae testamenti unae per
legatos eius Romam erant allatae, ut in aerario ponerentur (hic
cum propter publicas occupationes poni non potuissent, apud
Pompeium sunt depositae), alterae eodem exemplo relictae atque
obsignatae Alexandriae proferebantur.

Due to the boy's age, he had a guardian in the royal
administration, a eunuch by the name of Pothinus.  This man
started out by complaining and waxing indignant to his friends
that the king was being summoned to plead his case; then, after
obtaining some supporters for his plan from the king's friends,
he secretly called the army from Pelusium to Alexandria and
placed the same Achillas that we mentioned above in charge of
all the troops.  Using messengers carrying letters, he informed
this man, who was roused and puffed up by his own and the king's
promises, what he wanted done.  In the will of Ptolomy Sr the
heirs had been designated: of his two sons, the elder, and of
his two daughters, the one who was first in age.  And to make
sure that this happened, in the same will Ptolomy called the
Roman people to witness, by all the gods and by the treaties
that he'd made in Rome.  One copy of the will had been brought
to Rome by his envoys, to be placed in the treasury (since they
hadn't been able to place them here, on account of the public
discord, they were entrusted to Pompey) the second, identical,
copy, they published and sealed, and left in Alexandria.
