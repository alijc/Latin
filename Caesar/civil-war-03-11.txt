11.1 Vibullius his expositis [Corcyrae] non minus necessarium esse
existimavit de repentino adventu Caesaris Pompeium fieri certiorem,
uti ad id consilium capere posset, antequam de mandatis agi
inciperetur, atque ideo continuato nocte ac die itinere atque
omnibus oppidis mutatis ad celeritatem iumentis ad Pompeium
contendit, ut adesse Caesarem nuntiaret.  Pompeius erat eo tempore
in Candavia iterque ex Macedonia in hiberna Apolloniam
Dyrrachiumque habebat.  Sed re nova perturbatus maioribus
itineribus Apolloniam petere coepit, ne Caesar orae maritimae
civitates occuparet.  At ille expositis militibus eodem die Oricum
proficiscitur.  Quo cum venisset, L. Torquatus, qui iussu Pompei
oppido praeerat praesidiumque ibi Parthinorum habebat, conatus
portis clausis oppidum defendere, cum Graecos murum ascendere atque
arma capere iuberet, illi autem se contra imperium populi Romani
pugnaturos esse negarent, oppidani autem etiam sua sponte Caesarem
recipere conarentur, desperatis omnibus auxiliis portas aperuit et
se atque oppidum Caesari dedidit incolumisque ab eo conservatus
est.


After Vibullius had disembarked (at Corcyra),
he deemed it necessary to confirm Caesar's sudden arrival to Pompey,
so that he could take counsel about it before undertaking to act on
the peace protocols.  And so by an journey that lasted an entire
day and night, changing horses in every town along the way, he
rushed to Pompey to report that Caesar was at hand.  At the time
Pompey was in Candavia and was marching from Macedonia to winter
quarters in Apollonia and Dyrrachium.  But, troubled by this news,
he commenced to make for Apollonia by longer marches, to keep
Caesar from capturing the cities on the sea shore.  But he, after
disembarking his soldiers, set out for Oricum the very same day.  And
when he got there, L. Torquatus, who was in command of the town by
Pompey's order and had a garrison of Parthinians there, attempted
to protect the town by closing the gates and ordering his Greeks to
take up arms and positions on the wall.  But when they refused to
fight against the authority of the people of Rome and the
townspeople even tried to admit Caesar of their own free will,
despairing of any relief, he opened the gates and surrendered to
Caesar, and was spared by him.
