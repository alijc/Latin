13.1 At Pompeius cognitis his rebus, quae erant Orici atque
Apolloniae gestae, Dyrrachio timens diurnis eo nocturnisque
itineribus contendit.  Simul Caesar appropinquare dicebatur,
tantusque terror incidit eius exercitui, quod properans noctem
diei coniunxerat neque iter intermiserat, ut paene omnes ex Epiro
finitimisque regionibus signa relinquerent, complures arma
proicerent ac fugae simile iter videretur.  Sed cum prope
Dyrrachium Pompeius constitisset castraque metari iussisset,
perterrito etiam tum exercitu princeps Labienus procedit iuratque
se eum non deserturum eundemque casum subiturum, quemcumque ei
fortuna tribuisset.  Hoc idem reliqui iurant legati; tribuni
militum centurionesque sequuntur, atque idem omnis exercitus
iurat.  Caesar praeoccupato itinere ad Dyrrachium finem properandi
facit castraque ad flumen Apsum ponit in finibus Apolloniatium, ut
bene meritae civitates tutae essent praesidio, ibique reliquarum
ex Italia legionum adventum exspectare et sub pellibus hiemare
constituit.  Hoc idem Pompeius fecit et trans flumen Apsum positis
castris eo copias omnes auxiliaque conduxit.


But when Pompey learned of what had happened at Oricum and
Apollonia, fearing for Dyrrachium, he extended his marches by
night and day to reach it.  Meanwhile, it was said that Caesar was
drawing near, and such a panic fell upon Pompey's army, that in a
hurry they joined night to day without interrupting their march,
so that nearly all from Epiros and the neighboring regions
abandoned their battle standards and threw away most of their arms, and
the march seemed to turn into a flight.  But after Pompey had come
to a halt near Dyrrachium and ordered a camp to be marked out,
with the army still terrified, First Officer Labienus came forward
and swore that he wouldn't desert Pompey, but would undergo the
same fate as him, whatever fortune might grant.  The rest of the
officers swore the same; the military tribunes and centurions
followed suit, and the whole army swore likewise.  Because Pompey
had beat him to Dyrrachium, Caesar slowed down and pitched camp
near the Apsus River, within the borders of Apollonia, to provide
defense to the cities, which well deserved it, and there he
arranged to wait for the arrival of the rest of the legions from
Italy, and to winter over in camp.  Pompey did the same, and after
pitching his camp on the other side of the Apsus River drew
together all his troops and auxilaries.
