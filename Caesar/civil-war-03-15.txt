15.1 Bibulus, ut supra demonstratum est, erat cum classe ad Oricum
et, sicuti mari portibusque Caesarem prohibebat, ita ipse omni terra
earum regionum prohibebatur; praesidiis enim dispositis omnia litora
a Caesare tenebantur, neque lignandi atque aquandi neque naves ad
terram religandi potestas fiebat.  Erat res in magna difficultate,
summisque angustiis rerum necessariarum premebantur, adeo ut
cogerentur sicuti reliquum commeatum ita ligna atque aquam Corcyra
navibus onerariis supportare; atque etiam uno tempore accidit, ut
difficilioribus usi tempestatibus ex pellibus, quibus erant tectae
naves, nocturnum excipere rorem cogerentur; quas tamen difficultates
patienter atque aequo animo ferebant neque sibi nudanda litora et
relinquendos portus existimabant.  Sed cum essent in quibus
demonstravi angustiis, ac se Libo cum Bibulo coniunxisset, loquuntur
ambo ex navibus cum M. Acilio et Statio Murco legatis; quorum alter
oppidi muris, alter praesidiis terrestribus praeerat: velle se de
maximis rebus cum Caesare loqui, si sibi eius rei facultas detur.
Huc addunt pauca rei confirmandae causa, ut de compositione acturi
viderentur.  Interim postulant ut sint indutiae, atque ab eis
impetrant.  Magnum enim, quod afferebant, videbatur, et Caesarem id
summe sciebant cupere, et profectum aliquid Vibulli mandatis
existimabatur.


Bibulus, as has been described above, was at Oricus with a fleet and,
just as he was keeping Caesar away from the sea and harbors, so he
himself was being held back from all lands in the region; for all the
coasts were held by garrisons stationed by Caesar, and Bibulus'
troops couldn't collect firewood or water, or to tie their ships up
to dry land.  This was a very difficult matter, and they were hard
pressed by the great difficulties of their necessities, so much so
that they were forced to use cargo ships to carry in the rest of
their provisions from Corcyra, as well as firewood and water.  It
even happened once, while experiencing rather nasty storms, that they
were forced to harvest dew from the tarps that covered the ships.
Nevertheless, they bore these difficulties with patience and level
heads and gave no thought to abandoning the harbors and leaving the
coasts unguarded.  But while they were in these straits that I have
recounted, and after Libo had joined up with Bibulus, they both spoke
from their ships with the legates M. Acilius and Statius Murcus; one
of whom commanded the walls of the town, and the other the
territorial garrisons: saying that they wished to speak with Caesar
about the greatest matters, if they were given the means to such a
thing.  They added a few things to this for the sake of confirming
the matter, so that they seemed to be acting on an agreement.  In the
meantime they demanded, and obtained, a truce.  For what they seemed
to be bringing was great, and they knew that Caesar wanted it a great
deal, and they assumed that Vibullius' commission would be
successful.
