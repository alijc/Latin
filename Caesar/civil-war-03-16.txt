16.1 Caesar eo tempore cum legione una profectus ad recipiendas
ulteriores civitates et rem frumentariam expediendam, qua angusta
utebatur, erat ad Buthrotum, oppidum oppositum Corcyrae.  Ibi certior
ab Acilio et Murco per litteras factus de postulatis Libonis et Bibuli
legionem relinquit; ipse Oricum revertitur.  Eo cum venisset,
evocantur illi ad colloquium.  Prodit Libo atque excusat Bibulum, quod
is iracundia summa erat inimicitiasque habebat etiam privatas cum
Caesare ex aedilitate et praetura conceptas: ob eam causam colloquium
vitasse, ne res maximae spei maximaeque utilitatis eius iracundia
impedirentur.  Suam summam esse ac fuisse semper voluntatem, ut
componeretur atque ab armis discederetur, sed potestatem eius rei
nullam habere, propterea quod de consilii sententia summam belli
rerumque omnium Pompeio permiserint.  Sed postulatis Caesaris cognitis
missuros ad Pompeium, atque illum reliqua per se acturum hortantibus
ipsis.  Interea manerent indutiae, dum ab illo rediri posset, neve
alter alteri noceret.  Huc addit pauca de causa et de copiis
auxiliisque suis.


At the time Caesar had advanced with a single legion to recapture the
most distant towns and secure his grain supply, which had become
uncertain, and was at Buthrotum, a town across from Corcyra.  When
informed there by Acilius and Murcus through letters about the
requests of Libo and Bibulus, he left the legion and returned to
Oricum.  When he arrived there, they were summoned to speak with him.
Libo came forward and made an excuse for Bibulus, because he was in a
violent temper and still had a personal enmity for Caesar, formed from
the the time of his aedileship and praetorship, saying: That he had
for this reason avoided the conference, to keep from impeding these
matters of such great hope and great advantage.  That his utmost
desire was, and always had been, for a reconciliation and laying down
of arms.  But he hadn't had the power to accomplish this, since, with
regard to the counsel's opinion, they'd entrusted Pompey with the
ultimate power over the war, and everything else as well.  But after
he learned of Caesar's demands, he would send them to Pompey, and he
would act on what remained himself, urging them on.  In the meantime,
the truce should stand, and no one should do harm to another, until an
answer could be returned.  He added a little about the cause and about
his troops and auxiliaries.
