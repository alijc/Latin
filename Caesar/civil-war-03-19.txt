19.1 Inter bina castra Pompei atque Caesaris unum flumen tantum intererat
Apsus, crebraque inter se colloquia milites habebant, neque ullum interim
telum per pactiones loquentium traiciebatur.  Mittit P. Vatinium legatum ad
ripam ipsam fluminis, qui ea, quae maxime ad pacem pertinere viderentur,
ageret et crebro magna voce pronuntiaret, liceretne civibus ad cives de
pace legatos mittere, quod etiam fugitivis ab saltu Pyrenaeo praedonibusque
licuisset, praesertim eum id agerent, ne cives cum civibus armis
decertarent?  Multa suppliciter locutus est, ut de sua atque omnium salute
debebat, silentioque ab utrisque militibus auditus.  Responsum est ab
altera parte Aulum Varronem profiteri se altera die ad colloquium venturum
atque una visurum, quemadmodum tuto legati venire et quae vellent exponere
possent; certumque ei rei tempus constituitur.  Quo cum esset postero die
ventum, magna utrimque multitudo convenit, magnaque erat exspectatio eius
rei, atque omnium animi intenti esse ad pacem videbantur.  Qua ex
frequentia, Titus Labienus prodit, sed missa oratione de pace, loqui atque
altercari cum Vatinio incipit.  Quorum mediam orationem interrumpunt subito
undique tela immissa; quae ille obtectus armis militum vitavit; vulnerantur
tamen complures, in his Cornelius Balbus, M. Plotius, L. Tiburtius,
centuriones militesque nonnulli.  Tum Labienus: "desinite ergo de
compositione loqui; nam nobis nisi Caesaris capite relato pax esse nulla
potest."


Only a single river, the Apsus, lay between the two camps of Pompey and
Caesar, and the soldiers were holding constant parleys with the other side,
and, by agreement, no weapon was hurled during the parleys.  Caesar sent
the envoy P. Vatinius right up to the river-bank, to do what seemed to
greatly relate to peace, and to repeatedly announce in a loud voice,
whether citizens would be allowed to send peace delegations to fellow
citizens, something had been even permitted to deserters and thieves from
the Pyrenaean forest, especially since they might prevent citizens from
fighting with their fellow citizens under arms?  He said much, in a humble
entreaty, as he ought to have, considering his own, and every man's,
safety, and was heard by soldiers in silence on both sides.  He was
answered from the other side, that Aulus Varro declared that he would come
and visit for a parley on some other day, when the envoys would be able to
safely come and set forth what they wanted; and a time for the business was
determined.  And after it came on the next day, a great multitude assembled
from both sides, and they had high expectations for the matter, and the
hearts of all seemed to hold out for peace.  And Titus Labienus advanced
from the crowd, but commenced to speak with Vatinius and argue with him,
disregarding his speech about peace.  But his speech was suddenly
interrupted in the middle when spears were hurled in from both sides.  He
escaped these, protected by the shields of the soldiers; nevertheless many
were wounded, among whom were Cornelius Balbus, M. Plotius, L. Tiburtius,
and several centurions and soldiers.  Then Labienus said: "Now stop talking
about an agreement; for unless the head of Caesar is brought to us, there
can be no peace."
