23.1 Libo profectus ab Orico cum classe, cui praeerat, navium L,
Brundisium venit insulamque, quae contra portum Brundisinum est,
occupavit, quod praestare arbitrabatur unum locum, qua necessarius
nostris erat egressus, quam omnia litora ac portus custodia clausos
teneri.  Hic repentino adventu naves onerarias quasdam nactus
incendit et unam frumento onustam abduxit magnumque nostris
terrorem iniecit et noctu militibus ac sagittariis in terram
expositis praesidium equitum deiecit et adeo loci opportunitate
profecit, uti ad Pompeium litteras mitteret, naves reliquas, si
vellet, subduci et refici iuberet: sua classe auxilia sese Caesaris
prohibiturum.

Libo, after leaving Oricum in command of a fleet of 50 ships, came
to Brundisium and captured the island that lay opposite its harbor,
because he deemed it better to hold the one spot that we'd need to
sail past than to garrison all the coasts and blockade the ports.
During his unexpected arrival he met up with some cargo ships and
fired them and carried off one that was loaded with provisions,
which instilled a great alarm in us.  And in the night, he
disembarked infantry and archers and routed a detachment of horse,
and profited so well from this opportunity that he sent letters to
Pompey, proposing, if he agreed, that he order the rest of his
ships to be withdrawn and refitted: he'd use his own fleet to keep
Caesar's auxiliaries from reaching him.
