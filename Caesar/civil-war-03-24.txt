24.1 Erat eo tempore Antonius Brundisii; is virtute militum
confisus scaphas navium magnarum circiter LX cratibus pluteisque
contexit eoque milites delectos imposuit atque eas in litore
pluribus locis separatim disposuit navesque triremes duas, quas
Brundisii faciendas curaverat, per causam exercendorum remigum
ad fauces portus prodire iussit.  Has cum audacius progressas
Libo vidisset, sperans intercipi posse, quadriremes V ad eas
misit.  Quae cum navibus nostris appropinquassent, nostri
veterani in portum refugiebant: illi studio incitati incautius
sequebantur.  Iam ex omnibus partibus subito Antonianae scaphae
signo dato se in hostes incitaverunt primoque impeto unam ex his
quadriremibus cum remigibus defensoribusque suis ceperunt,
reliquas turpiter refugere coegerunt.  Ad hoc detrimentum
accessit, ut equitibus per oram maritimam ab Antonio dispositis
aquari prohiberentur.  Qua necessitate et ignominia permotus
Libo discessit a Brundisio obsessionemque nostrorum omisit.


Anthony was at Brundisium at the time; confident in the courage
of his men; he covered around 60 lighters of his ships
with wickerwork and breastworks and positioned elite soldiers on
them, and distributed the boats on shore in many places.  And separately,
he ordered two triremes, that he'd built in Brundisium, out into
the mouth of the harbor, under the pretext of exercising the
oarsmen.  After Libo saw these boldly issuing forth he sent 5
quadriremes against them, in hopes that he could intercept them.
And when they'd gotten close to our ships, our experienced
soldiers fled back into the harbor: they, in their enthusiasm,
incautiously pursued us.  And then suddenly, when the signal was
given, Anthony's lighters sallied out from every side against
the enemy.  In the first assault they captured one of these
quadriremes, along with its oarsmen and fighters, and forced the
the rest to flee in chaos.  He added to this defeat, so that
they'd be kept from fetching water by the cavalry that Anthony
had positions along the seashore.  And Libo, agitated by this
difficulty and dishonor, lifted the blockade and withdrew from
Brundisium.
