25.1 Multi iam menses erant et hiems praecipitaverat, neque Brundisio
naves legionesque ad Caesarem veniebant.  Ac nonnullae eius rei
praetermissae occasiones Caesari videbantur, quod certi saepe
flaverant venti, quibus necessario committendum existimabat.
Quantoque eius amplius processerat temporis, tanto erant alacriores ad
custodias, qui classibus praeerant, maioremque fiduciam prohibendi
habebant, et crebris Pompei litteris castigabantur, quoniam primo
venientem Caesarem non prohibuissent, ut reliquos eius exercitus
impedirent, duriusque cotidie tempus ad transportandum lenioribus
ventis exspectabant.  Quibus rebus permotus Caesar Brundisium ad suos
severius scripsit, nacti idoneum ventum ne occasionem navigandi
dimitterent, sive ad litora Apolloniatium [sive ad Labeatium] cursum
dirigere atque eo naves eicere possent.  Haec a custodiis classium
loca maxime vacabant, quod se longius a portibus committere non
audebant.


They'd been there for many months now and winter was coming to an end,
and there were no ships or legions coming to Caesar from Brundisium.
And it seemed to Caesar that they'd missed some opportunities, because
surely there had often been winds that he deemed suitable for them to
join up.  And however much the season advanced, Pompey's fleet
commanders were that much sharper at the watch, and had greater
confidence for their blockade.  They were being chastized in frequent
letters from Pompey that, since they hadn't staved Caesar off when he
first arrived, they should obstruct the rest of his armies, which were
waiting for gentler winds to transport them, and the time was getting
shorter, day by day.  Disturbed by these matters, Caesar wrote to his
men in Brundisium rather sternly, that, if they obtained a favorable
wind, they shouldn't let slip the chance of sailing - that they could
set course for the shore at either Apolloniatium or Labeatium and
drive the ships there out.  These locations were particularly missing
the fleets' watch, because they dared not to expose themselves far
from the harbors.
