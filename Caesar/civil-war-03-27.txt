27.1
Hic subitam commutationem fortunae videre licuit.
Qui modo sibi timuerant, hos tutissimus portus recipiebat;
qui nostris navibus periculum intulerant, de suo timere cogebantur.
Itaque tempore commutato tempestas et nostros texit et naves Rhodias afflixit,
ita ut ad unam omnes, constratae numero XVI,
eliderentur et naufragio interirent,
et ex magno remigum propugnatorumque
numero pars ad scopulos allisa interficeretur,
pars ab nostris detraheretur;
quos omnes conservatos Caesar domum dimisit.


It was possible to see a sudden reversal of fortune there.
Those who had feared for their own lives
had withdrawn into the well-protected harbor;
while those who had brought peril to our ships
were compelled to fear for themselves.
And so, after the weather completely altered,
it both protected our men and wrecked the Rhodian ships,
so that all of them, including 16 decked ships,
were dashed to pieces and lost in the wreck.
Of the great number of oarsmen and fighters,
some were dashed on the rocks and killed, and others pulled out by our men.
Caesar sent all of those who survived back home.
