28.1 Nostrae naves duae tardius cursu confecto in noctem
coniectae, cum ignorarent, quem locum reliquae cepissent, contra
Lissum in ancoris constiterunt.  Has scaphis minoribusque
navigiis compluribus immissis Otacilius Crassus, qui Lissi
praeerat, expugnare parabat; simul de deditione eorum agebat et
incolumitatem deditis pollicebatur.  Harum altera navis CCXX e
legione tironum sustulerat, altera ex veterana paulo minus CC.
Hic cognosci licuit, quantum esset hominibus praesidii in animi
firmitudine.  Tirones enim multitudine navium perterriti et salo
nauseaque confecti iureiurando accepto, nihil eis nocituros
hostes, se Otacilio dediderunt; qui omnes ad eum producti contra
religionem iurisiurandi in eius conspectu crudelissime
interficiuntur.  At veteranae legionis milites, item conflictati
et tempestatis et sentinae vitiis, neque ex pristina virtute
remittendum aliquid putaverunt, et tractandis condicionibus et
simulatione deditionis extracto primo noctis tempore gubernatorem
in terram navem eicere cogunt, ipsi idoneum locum nacti reliquam
noctis partem ibi confecerunt et luce prima missis ad eos ab
Otacilio equitibus, qui eam partem orae maritimae asservabant,
circiter CCCC, quique eos armati ex praesidio secuti sunt, se
defenderunt et nonnullis eorum interfectis incolumes se ad
nostros receperunt.


Two of our ships, traveling into the night because of their
slower voyage and not knowing where the others had landed, set
anchor opposite Lissus.  Otacilius Crassus, who was in command
there, prepared for battle, sending many skiffs and small vessels
against these ships; at the same time he was negotiating their
surrender and promising safety to those who gave themselves up.
One of these ships was carrying 220 fresh recruits from the
legion, while the other a few less than 200 veterans.  Here one
could learn as much as possible from men on defense and strength
of spirit.  For the recruits, terrified by the great number of
ships and done in by billows and sea-sickness, took his oath at
face value and, thinking that the enemy would do them no harm,
gave themselves up to Otacilius.  And they were all led up to him
and, contrary to the sanctity of his oath, were most cruelly
killed in his sight.  But the soldiers of the veteran legions,
likewise tormented by the problems of both storm and bilge water,
didn't think about relaxing from their former courage, but,
making a pretense of surrender and dragging out the discussion of
terms, forced the helmsman to drive the ship onto land early in
the night.  Then they grabbed a good spot and spent the rest of
the night there.  At first light, when they were attacked by
about 400 well-armed cavalry, who'd been sent by Otacilius to
guard that part of the sea shore.  But they defended themselves,
chasing the enemy away from their encampment, and after killing a
number of them safely withdrew to our own lines.
