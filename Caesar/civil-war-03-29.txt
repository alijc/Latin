29.1 Quo facto conventus civium Romanorum, qui Lissum obtinebant,
quod oppidum eis antea Caesar attribuerat muniendumque curaverat,
Antonium recepit omnibusque rebus iuvit.  Otacilius sibi timens
ex oppido fugit et ad Pompeium pervenit.  Expositis omnibus
copiis Antonius, quarum erat summa veteranarum trium legionum
uniusque tironum et equitum DCCC, plerasque naves in Italiam
remittit ad reliquos milites equitesque transportandos, pontones,
quod est genus navium Gallicarum, Lissi relinquit, hoc consilio,
ut si forte Pompeius vacuam existimans Italiam eo traiecisset
exercitum, quae opinio erat edita in vulgus, aliquam Caesar ad
insequendum facultatem haberet, nuntiosque ad eum celeriter
mittit, quibus regionibus exercitum exposuisset et quid militum
transvexisset.

After this happened an assembly of the Roman citizens who held
Lissus accepted Antony and aided him in all things, because
Caesar had previously granted the town to them and had seen to
its fortifications.  Otacilius, fearing for his own safety, fled
the town and went to Pompey.  Antony, after disembarking all of
his troops, totaling three legions of veterans and of one of
recruits and 800 horse, sent most of the ships back to Italy to
tranport the rest of the soldiers and cavalry.  He left his
pontoons, a sort of Gallic ship, at Lissus, with the plan that
Caesar should have some means of pursuing Pompey, if by chance he
had transported his army to Italy, thinking it unoccupied.  This
belief was widely held among the general public.  He quickly sent
messengers to Caesar, on where he'd landed his army, and what
sort of soldiers he'd transported.
