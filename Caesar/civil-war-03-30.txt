30.1 Haec eodem fere tempore Caesar atque Pompeius cognoscunt.
Nam praetervectas Apolloniam Dyrrachiumque naves viderant ipsi,
ut iter secundum eas terras direxerant, sed quo essent eae
delatae, primus diebus ignorabant.  Cognitaque re diversa sibi
ambo consilia capiunt: Caesar, ut quam primum se cum Antonio
coniungeret; Pompeius, ut venientibus in itinere se opponeret, si
imprudentes ex insidiis, adoriri posset, eodemque die uterque
eorum ex castris stativis a flumine Apso exercitum educunt:
Pompeius clam et noctu, Caesar palam atque interdiu.  Sed Caesari
circuitu maiore iter erat longius, adverso flumine, ut vado
transire posset; Pompeius, quia expedito itinere flumen ei
transeundum non erat, magnis itineribus ad Antonium contendit
atque eum ubi appropinquare cognovit, idoneum locum nactus ibi
copias collocavit suosque omnes in castris continuit ignesque
fieri prohibuit, quo occultior esset eius adventus.  Haec ad
Antonium statim per Graecos deferuntur.  Ille missis ad Caesarem
nuntiis unum diem sese castris tenuit; altero die ad eum pervenit
Caesar.  Cuius adventu cognito Pompeius, ne duobus
circumcluderetur exercitibus, ex eo loco discedit omnibusque
copiis ad Asparagium Dyrrachinorum pervenit atque ibi idoneo loco
castra ponit.


Caesar and Pompey learned of these things at nearly the same
time.  For they had seen the ships that had passed Apollonia and
Dyrrachium, and had both directed their own march to those
regions, but where the ships would be borne, they didn't know at
first.  And when the fact became known, each man seized on his
own distinct plan: Caesar, to join up with Antony as quickly as
possible; Pompey, to oppose those who were coming and, if he
could, to catch them in an ambush.  Both of them led their armies
out of their permanent camps by the Apso River on the same day:
Pompey under cover of darkness, and Caesar openly in the daytime.
But Caesar's route was much longer, as he turned towards the
river so that he could ford it; Pompey, since he was marching
with no baggage and had no need to cross the river, strove
towards Antony by forced marches.  And when he found that he was
close to him, he secured an advantageous position and assembled
his troops.  He kept all of his men in camp, forbidding them to
make fires, so their arrival would be kept secret.  The Greeks at
once informed Antony of these things, and he sent messengers to
Caesar and held to his camp for one day; and on the next day
Caesar reached him.  When Pompey learned of his arrival he
withdrew from his position, to keep from being surrounded by two
armies, and made for Asparagium of the Dyrrachians with all his
troops and there pitched camp in a suitable site.
