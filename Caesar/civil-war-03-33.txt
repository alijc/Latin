33.1 Praeterea Ephesi a fano Dianae depositas antiquitus pecunias
Scipio tolli iubebat.  Certaque eius rei die constituta cum in
fanum ventum esset adhibitis compluribus ordinis senatorii, quos
advocaverat Scipio, litterae ei redduntur a Pompeio, mare transisse
cum legionibus Caesarem: properaret ad se cum exercitu venire
omniaque posthaberet.  His litteris acceptis quos advocaverat
dimittit; ipse iter in Macedoniam parare incipit paucisque post
diebus est profectus.  Haec res Ephesiae pecuniae salutem attulit.


Moreover, Scipio commanded his men to steal the money that had been
deposited, ages ago, in the temple of Diana in Ephesus.  And on the
day fixed for this deed, after Scipio had entered the temple, with
many men of senatorial rank that he had summoned, letters from
Pompey were delivered to him, telling him that Caesar had crossed
the sea with his legions: and ordering him to come to him with his
army in all due haste, subordinating everything else to this.
After receiving these letters, he dismissed those whom he had
summoned; he set to preparing for the march to Macedonia and set
out a few days later.  This brought the affair of the Ephesian
money to a safe conclusion.
