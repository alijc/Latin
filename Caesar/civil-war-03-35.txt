35.1 Ex his Calvisius primo adventu summa omnium Aetolorum receptus
voluntate, praesidiis adversariorum Calydone et Naupacto eiectis, omni
Aetolia potitus est.  Cassius in Thessaliam cum legione pervenit.  Hic
cum essent factiones duae, varia voluntate civitatum utebatur:
Hegesaretos, veteris homo potentiae, Pompeianis rebus studebat; Petraeus,
summae nobilitatis adulescens, suis ac suorum opibus Caesarem enixe
iuvabat.


Of these two, Calvisius, after receiving the greatest good will of all
the Aetolians when he first arrived, expelled the enemy garrisons
from Calydonum and Naupactum and became master of all of Aetolia.  Cassius
arrived in Thessaly with a legion.  Since there were two factions there, he
made use of the competing wills of the cities: Hegesaretos, a man of
long-established power, was eager for the Pompeian cause; Petraeus, a
youth of the highest nobility, was aiding Caesar with his own resources
and those of his men.
