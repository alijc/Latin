37.1 Scipio biduum castris stativis moratus ad flumen, quod inter
eum et Domitii castra fluebat, Aliacmonem, tertio die prima luce
exercitum vado traducit et castris positis postero die mane
copias ante frontem castrorum instruit.  Domitius tum quoque sibi
dubitandum non putavit, quin productis legionibus proelio
decertaret.  Sed cum esset inter bina castra campus circiter
milium passuum II, Domitius castris Scipionis aciem suam
subiecit; ille a vallo non discedere perseveravit.  Ac tamen
aegre retentis Domitianis militibus est factum, ne proelio
contenderetur, et maxime, quod rivus difficilibus ripis subiectus
castris Scipionis progressus nostrorum impediebat.  Quorum
studium alacritatemque pugnandi cum cognovisset Scipio,
suspicatus fore, ut postero die aut invitus dimicare cogeretur
aut magna cum infamia castris se contineret, qui magna
exspectatione venisset, temere progressus turpem habuit exitum et
noctu ne conclamatis quidem vasis flumen transit atque in eandem
partem, ex qua venerat, redit ibique prope flumen edito natura
loco castra posuit.  Paucis diebus interpositis noctu insidias
equitum collocavit, quo in loco superioribus fere diebus nostri
pabulari consueverant; et cum cotidiana consuetudine Qu. Varus,
praefectus equitum Domitii, venisset, subito illi ex insidiis
consurrexerunt.  Sed nostri fortiter impetum eorum tulerunt,
celeriterque ad suos quisque ordines rediit, atque ultro universi
in hostes impetum fecerunt; ex his circiter LXXX interfectis,
reliquis in fugam coniectis, duobus amissis in castra se
receperunt.


Scipio was delayed for two days at his quarters near the
Aliacmona river, which flowed between him and Domitius' camp.  At
first light on the third day he led his army across a ford and
pitched camp, and early in the morning on the next day drew his
troops up before the camp.  Then Domitius likewise didn't
hesitate to lead his legions forward to battle in order to fight.
Now there was a plain about two miles long between the two camps;
Domitius set up his battle array near Scipio's camp; while Scipio
continued to stick close to his own ramparts.  And yet Domitius
could scarcely hold his soldiers back, to keep from being hurled
into battle, and especially because a stream with difficult banks
below Scipio's camp hindered the progress of our men.  When
Scipio had learned of their zeal and eagerness for the fight, he
suspected that he, who had arrived with such great expectation,
would either be compelled, reluctantly, to do battle on the
following day or would have shut himself up in camp with great
dishonor.  He considered his rash advance as unseemly, and by
night, keeping even the army's equipment from making noise, he
crossed the river and returned to the same side that he'd come
from, and there set up camp near the river in a naturally
elevated site.  After a few days, he set an ambush of cavalry in
the night, in the place where our men had been most recently
accustomed to forage; and after Qu. Varus, commander of Domitius'
horse, arrived, in his regular habit, they suddenly rose up out
of ambush.  But our men bore their attack bravely, and each one
swiftly fell back to their ranks, and all together returned the
assault against the enemy.  About 80 of these were killed, with
the rest thrown into flight, while our forces retired to camp
with the loss of two.
