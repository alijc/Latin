41.1 Caesar, postquam Pompeium ad Asparagium esse cognovit, eodem
cum exercitu profectus expugnato in itinere oppido Parthinorum,
in quo Pompeius praesidium habebat, tertio die ad Pompeium
pervenit iuxtaque eum castra posuit et postridie eductis omnibus
copiis acie instructa decernendi potestatem Pompeio fecit.  Ubi
illum suis locis se tenere animadvertit, reducto in castra
exercitu aliud sibi consilium capiendum existimavit.  Itaque
postero die omnibus copiis magno circuitu difficili angustoque
itinere Dyrrachium profectus est sperans Pompeium aut Dyrrachium
compelli aut ab eo intercludi posse, quod omnem commeatum
totiusque belli apparatum eo contulisset; ut accidit Pompeius
enim primo ignorans eius consilium, quod diverso ab ea regione
itinere profectum videbat, angustiis rei frumentariae compulsum
discessisse existimabat; postea per exploratores certior factus
postero die castra movit, breviore itinere se occurrere ei posse
sperans.  Quod fore suspicatus Caesar militesque adhortatus, ut
aequo animo laborem ferrent, parvam partem noctis itinere
intermisso mane Dyrrachium venit, cum primum agmen Pompei procul
cerneretur, atque ibi castra posuit.


After Caesar learned that Pompey was at Asparagium, he set out
with his army to the same place, stopping on the way to storm a
Parthenian town where Pompey had a garrison.  On the third day he
reached Pompey and pitched camp nearby, and on the next day he
led out all his forces and drew them up and gave Pompey an
opportunity for combat.  When he observed that he held to his own
positions, he brought the army back to camp and considered taking
up some other plan.  And so on the next day, taking all his
forces in a wide circle on a rough and difficult road, he set out
for Dyrrachium, hoping that he could either dislodge Pompey, or
cut him off from Dyrrachium, where he'd gathered up all his
supplies for the entire war.  And so it happened, for Pompey, not
knowing his plan at first, saw him set out on a misleading route
out of the area, and assumed that he'd had to withdraw due to a
lack of supplies.  Then the next day, after getting information
from his scouts, he shifted camp, hoping that he could catch up
with Caesar by using a shorter route.  Caesar, suspecting what
was about to happen, urged his soldiers to bear the toil with a
calm mind, interrupting the march for only a small part of the
night, he came to Dyrrachium early in the morning and set up camp,
just as Pompey's column was spied in the distance.
