42.1 Pompeius interclusus Dyrrachio, ubi propositum tenere non
potuit, secundo usus consilio edito loco, qui appellatur Petra
aditumque habet navibus mediocrem atque eas a quibusdam protegit
ventis, castra communit.  Eo partem navium longarum convenire,
frumentum commeatumque ab Asia atque omnibus regionibus, quas
tenebat, comportari imperat.  Caesar longius bellum ductum iri
existimans et de Italicis commeatibus desperans, quod tanta
diligentia omni litora a Pompeianis tenebantur, classesque ipsius,
quas hieme in Sicilia, Gallia, Italia fecerat, morabantur, in
Epirum rei frumentariae causa Q. Tillium et L. Canuleium legatum
misit, quodque hae regiones aberant longius, locis certis horrea
constituit vecturasque frumenti finitimis civitatibus descripsit.
Item Lisso Parthinisque et omnibus castellis quod esset frumenti
conquiri iussit.  Id erat perexiguum cum ipsius agri natura, quod
sunt loca aspera ac montuosa ac plerumque frumento utuntur
importato, tum quod Pompeius haec providerat et superioribus
diebus praedae loco Parthinos habuerat frumentumque omne
conquisitum spoliatis effossisque eorum domibus per equites
comportarat.


After Pompey's plan fell apart and he was cut off from Dyrrachium,
he came up with a new plan and built a fortified camp in an
elevated spot.  This place is called the Rock and has tolerable
access for ships and protects them from some winds.  He ordered a
portion of the galleys to assemble there, and provisions to be
transported there from Asia and all the regions that he held.
Caesar assumed that the war would be prolonged and dispaired of
geting supplies from Italy, because the whole coast was held with
such diligence by Pompey's men, and because his fleets, built in
Sicily, Gaul, and Italy over the winter, were delayed, and
therefore sent the legates Q. Tillius and L. Canuleius to Epirus
after grain.  And because these regions were far off, he erected
storehouses in certain places and wrote to the nearby towns to
arrange for the transportation of grain.  Likewise, he ordered
that whatever grain there was should be hunted up from Lissus and
Parthini and all the redoubts.  This was insignificant, what with
the nature of those rough and mountainous fields, (For the most
part those people need to import their grain.)  and also because
Pompey had foreseen these things and in the last few days had had
the land of the Parthinians plundered and had used his cavalry to
collect all the grain amassed from their plundered and emptied
houses.
