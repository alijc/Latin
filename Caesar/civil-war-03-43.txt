43.1 Quibus rebus cognitis Caesar consilium capit ex loci natura.
Erant enim circum castra Pompei permulti editi atque asperi colles.
Hos primum praesidiis tenuit castellaque ibi communit.  Inde, ut loci
cuiusque natura ferebat, ex castello in castellum perducta munitione
circumvallare Pompeium instituit, haec spectans, quod angusta re
frumentaria utebatur quodque Pompeius multitudine equitum valebat,
quo minore periculo undique frumentum commeatumque exercitui
supportare posset, simul, uti pabulatione Pompeium prohiberet
equitatumque eius ad rem gerendam inutilem efficeret, tertio, ut
auctoritatem qua ille maxime apud exteras nationes niti videbatur,
minueret, cum fama per orbem terrarum percrebuisset, illum a Caesare
obsideri neque audere proelio dimicare.


When Caesar realized this he formed a plan that used the nature of
the place.  For there were very many high, jagged hills around
Pompey's camp.  First, he seized these for his own defense and
fortified strongholds there.  Next, as the nature of the site led, he
undertook to lengthen his fortifications, from stronghold to
stronghold, and surround Pompey.  Bearing in mind that he only had
the use of a constrained grain supply and that Pompey had the
strength of a throng of cavalry which he could use to transport grain
and supplies to his army from all directions, with little danger, his
aim was to keep Pompey from foraging and at the same time render his
cavalry unable to act, and also to diminish, after the report spread
throughout the world that he was blockaded by Caesar and didn't dare
to venture out to do battle, the reputation that Pompey seemed to
enjoy, especially among foreign nations.
