45.1 In occupandis praesidiis magna vi uterque nitebatur: Caesar, ut
quam angustissime Pompeium contineret; Pompeius, ut quam plurimos
colles quam maximo circuitu occuparet, crebraque ob eam causam
proelia fiebant.  In his cum legio Caesaris nona praesidium quoddam
occupavisset et munire coepisset, huic loco propinquum et contrarium
collem Pompeius occupavit nostrosque opere prohibere coepit et, cum
una ex parte prope aequum aditum haberet, primum sagittariis
funditoribusque circumiectis, postea levis armaturae magna
multitudine missa tormentisque prolatis munitiones impediebat; neque
erat facile nostris uno tempore propugnare et munire.  Caesar, cum
suos ex omnibus partibus vulnerari videret, recipere se iussit et
loco excedere.  Erat per declive receptus.  Illi autem hoc acrius
instabant neque regredi nostros patiebantur, quod timore adducti
locum relinquere videbantur.  Dicitur eo tempore glorians apud suos
Pompeius dixisse: non recusare se, quin nullius usus imperator
existimaretur, si sine maximo detrimento legiones Caesaris sese
recepissent inde, quo temere essent progressae.


In attacking the redoubts each side advanced with great strength:
Caesar, to hem Pompey in as closely as possible; Pompey, to capture
as many hills and as large an area as possible, and for this reason
combat took place at close quarters.  In the midst of this, after
Caesar's ninth legion captured a certain redoubt and commenced to
fortify it, Pompey captured a nearby hill that faced it and, since
he had a nearly level approach from one side, began interfering with
our men's work. He obstructed us, first by positioning archers and
slingers on our flank, and then by sending in a great multitude of
light infantry and bringing siege engines forward; and it was not
easy for our men to defend themselves and erect fortifications at the
same time.  When Caesar saw his men receiving wounds from all sides,
he ordered them to retreat and to withdraw from the spot and they
retreated down the slope.  But at this the enemy were in fierce
pursuit and didn't allow our men to retreat, because it seemed that
they abandoned the spot in fear.  It is said that at the time Pompey
said, boasting at our men: that he couldn't object to being reckoned
a commander of no use, if Caesar's legions had not retreated from
their rash advance without a great deal of damage.
