46. Caesar receptui suorum timens crates ad extremum tumulum contra
hostem proferri et adversas locari, intra has mediocri latitudine
fossam tectis militibus obduci iussit locumque in omnes partes quam
maxime impediri.  Ipse idoneis locis funditores instruxit, ut
praesidio nostris se recipientibus essent.  His rebus comparatis
legionem reduci iussit.  Pompeiani hoc insolentius atque audacius
nostros premere et instare coeperunt cratesque pro munitione
obiectas propulerunt, ut fossas transcenderent.  Quod cum
animadvertisset Caesar, veritus, ne non reducti, sed reiecti
viderentur, maiusque detrimentum caperetur, a medio fere spatio
suos per Antonium, qui ei legioni praeerat, cohortatus tuba signum
dari atque in hostes impetum fieri iussit.  Milites legionis VIIII
subito conspirati pila coniecerunt et ex inferiore loco adversus
clivum incitati cursu praecipites Pompeianos egerunt et terga
vertere coegerunt; quibus ad recipiendum crates derectae
longuriique obiecti et institutae fossae magno impedimento fuerunt.
Nostri vero, qui satis habebant sine detrimento discedere,
compluribus interfectis V omnino suorum amissis quietissime se
receperunt pauloque citra eum locum aliis comprehensis collibus
munitiones perfecerunt.


Caesar, apprehensive about his men's safe retreat, ordered that
wickerwork be brought forward to the far side of the hillock and
set up facing the enemy, that a middling wide trench be roofed over
by the soldiers within this wickerwork, and that the position be
made as inaccessible as possible.  He positioned slingers in
suitable places as protection for our men in their retreat.  After
preparing these things he ordered the legion to be withdrawn.  At
this, Pompey's men commenced to insolently and audaciously press
and pursue our men, and pushed aside the wickerwork that we'd
thrown down as a fortification so they could get over the trenches.
When Caesar observed this, he feared that they were seen to have
been repulsed rather than recalled, and he might receive a greater
defeat.  When his men were nearly midway down the slope, urging
them through Antony, who commanded the legion for him, he
commanded that a trumpet signal be given to attack the enemy.  The
soldiers of the 9th legion cast their javelins in an unexpected
volley and in a fierce onrush from a lower position facing the
slope they drove Pompey's men headlong and forced them to turn
back; And for them, the upset wickerworks, jumbled poles and dug
trenches were a great impediment in their retreat.  Indeed our men,
who had enough on their plates just trying to get away unharmed,
after killling many man but losing only 5 of our own, made an
orderly withdrawl and just this side of that place completed
fortifications on the other hillocks that had been captured.
