49.1 Iamque frumenta maturescere incipiebant, atque ipsa spes
inopiam sustentabat, quod celeriter se habituros copiam
confidebant; crebraeque voces militum in vigiliis colloquiisque
audiebantur, prius se cortice ex arboribus victuros, quam
Pompeium e manibus dimissuros.  Libenter etiam ex perfugis
cognoscebant equos eorum tolerari, reliqua vero iumenta
interisse; uti autem ipsos valetudine non bona, cum angustiis
loci et odore taetro ex multitudine cadaverum et cotidianis
laboribus insuetos operum, tum aquae summa inopia affectos.
Omnia enim flumina atque omnes rivos, qui ad mare pertinebant,
Caesar aut averterat aut magnis operibus obstruxerat, atque ut
erant loca montuosa et aspera, angustias vallium sublicis in
terram demissis praesaepserat terramque aggesserat, ut aquam
contineret.  Itaque illi necessario loca sequi demissa ac
palustria et puteos fodere cogebantur atque hunc laborem ad
cotidiana opera addebant; qui tamen fontes a quibusdam praesidiis
aberant longius et celeriter aestibus exarescebant.  At Caesaris
exercitus optima valetudine summaque aquae copia utebatur, tum
commeatus omni genere praeter frumentum abundabat; quibus cotidie
melius succedere tempus maioremque spem maturitate frumentorum
proponi videbant.


And besides, the crops were coming ripe and the hope of this
supported them in their need, because they were sure that they'd
soon have plenty.  And they kept hearing soldiers, on watch and
in conversation, saying that they'd sooner live on tree bark than
let Pompey slip from their hands.  Besides, they were happy to
learn from deserters that their horses were suffering, and indeed
that the rest of their draft animals had died; and that they
themselves were not faring so well, what with the cramped
quarters and the foul smells from the heaps of corpses and having
become inured to the daily labors of fortification and affected
by a great lack of water to boot.  For Caesar had either diverted
or dammed up all the rivers and all the streams that flowed to
the sea, and where there were mountainous and uneven places, he
had blocked up the narrow valleys with stakes sunk in the ground
and covered with dirt, to contain the water.  And so they were
forced of necessity to range over low-lying and marshy places and
to dig wells, and they added this labor to their usual work.  And
yet the springs were far away from some of the garrisons and
quickly dried up in the heat.  But Caesar's army enjoyed the best
health and an excellent supply of water, moreover every sort of
supply except grain was abundant; and by these things they daily
saw that the season was advancing well and that their great hope
for the crops' ripening was set before them.
