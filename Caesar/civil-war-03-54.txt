54.1 Pompeius noctu magnis additis munitionibus reliquis diebus
turres exstruxit, et in altitudinem pedum XV effectis operibus
vineis eam partem castrorum obtexit, et quinque intermissis
diebus alteram noctem subnubilam nactus obstructis omnibus
castrorum portis et ad impediendum obicibus obiectis tertia inita
vigilia silentio exercitum eduxit et se in antiquas munitiones
recepit.


Pompey, after adding to his fortifications by night, built up
towers during the subsequent days, and after they reached a
height of 15 feet he covered that part of the camp with wicker
works.  After an interval of five days another overcast night
arrived, and barricading all the gates of the camp and throwing
barriers down in front of them to obstruct them, at the beginning
of the third watch he led the army out in silence and retreated
to his old fortifications.
