55.1 Omnibus deinceps diebus Caesar exercitum in aciem aequum in
locum produxit, si Pompeius proelio decertare vellet, ut paene
castris Pompei legiones subiceret; tantumque a vallo eius prima
acies aberat, uti ne telum tormento adigi posset.  Pompeius
autem, ut famam opinionemque hominum teneret, sic pro castris
exercitum constituebat, ut tertia acies vallum contingeret, omnis
quidem instructus exercitus telis ex vallo coniectis protegi
posset.


Caesar led his army forward into battle array on level ground on
each of the succeeding days, in case Pompey wanted to fight it
out, positioning his legions almost to Pompey's camp; with his
front rank just far enough away from from Pompey's palisade that
a missile cast from an engine couldn't reach it.  But Pompey, to
hold on to the fame and opinion of men, positioned his army in
front of the camp so that the third rank touched the palisade.
Indeed, the entire army so drawn up could be protected by
javelins thrown down from the palisade.
