9.1 Erant apud Caesarem in equitum numero Allobroges duo fratres,
Raucillus et Egus, Adbucilli filii, qui principatum in civitate
multis annis obtinuerat, singulari virtute homines, quorum opera
Caesar omnibus Gallicis bellis optima fortissimaque erat usus.
His domi ob has causas amplissimos magistratus mandaverat atque
eos extra ordinem in senatum legendos curaverat agrosque in
Gallia ex hostibus captos praemiaque rei pecuniariae magna
tribuerat locupletesque ex egentibus fecerat.  Hi propter
virtutem non solum apud Caesarem in honore erant, sed etiam apud
exercitum cari habebantur; sed freti amicitia Caesaris et stulta
ac barbara arrogantia elati despiciebant suos stipendiumque
equitum fraudabant et praedam omnem domum avertebant.  Quibus
illi rebus permoti universi Caesarem adierunt palamque de eorum
iniuriis sunt questi et ad cetera addiderunt falsum ab his
equitum numerum deferri, quorum stipendium averterent.


There were with Caesar among the calvary two Alloborgian
brothers, Raucillus and Egus, the sons of Adbucillus, who had
held the chief place in their city for many years.  These men
were remarkable for their courage, and Caesar had used their
great and mighty deeds in all the Gallic wars.  For these reasons
he had entrusted the most important magistracies at home to them
and had extraordinarily arranged for them to be selected for the
senate.  He had granted them captured fields in Gaul and rewards
of a monetary matter and had brought them from poverty to wealth.
On account of their courage they were not only held in Caesar's
regard, but were also considered the darlings of the army; but
trusting to Caesar's friendship and puffed up by the foolish
arrogance of foreigners they despised their comrades and
embezzled the cavalry's wages and looted every house.  And all
stirred up by these doings the soldiers approached Caesar and
publicly complained about the two men's offense.  In addition to
the other problems, they had padded the cavalry roll and stolen
the pay of the fake soldiers.
