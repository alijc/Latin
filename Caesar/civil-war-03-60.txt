60.1 Caesar neque tempus illud animadversionis esse existimans et
multa virtuti eorum concedens rem totam distulit; illos secreto
castigavit, quod quaestui equites haberent, monuitque, ut ex sua
amicitia omnia exspectarent et ex praeteritis suis officiis
reliqua sperarent.  Magnam tamen haec res illis offensionem et
contemptionem ad omnes attulit, idque ita esse cum ex aliorum
obiectationibus tum etiam ex domestico iudicio atque animi
conscientia intellegebant.  Quo pudore adducti et fortasse non se
liberari, sed in aliud tempus reservari arbitrati discedere a
nobis et novam temptare fortunam novasque amicitias experiri
constituerunt.  Et cum paucis collocuti clientibus suis, quibus
tantum facinus committere audebant, primum conati sunt praefectum
equitum C. Volusenum interficere, ut postea bello confecto
cognitum est, ut cum munere aliquo perfugisse ad Pompeium
viderentur; postquam id difficilius visum est neque facultas
perficiendi dabatur, quam maximas potuerunt pecunias mutuati,
proinde ac si suis satisfacere et fraudata restituere vellent,
multis coemptis equis ad Pompeium transierunt cum eis, quos sui
consilii participes habebant.


Caesar, judging that it was not the right time for censure, and
pardoning much for the sake of their courage, put the entire
matter off.  He reprimanded them in private, that they'd managed
the cavalry profitably, and warned them that they should have hop
from his friendship in all respects, and should look forward to
the future according to their past services.  But this brought
them great displeasure and scorn with everyone, and they
understood that it was so as from the reproaches of others and
moreover from their personal judgement and a remorse of the soul.
Persuaded by this shame, they decided that not only were they
were not necessarily acquitted, but, thinking that they'd been
spared for another time, that they should leave us and try a
change of fortune and alliances.  And after conferring with a few
of their comrades, with whom they were prepared to commit such an
outrage, they first attempted to kill C. Volusenus, the commander
of horse (as was discovered after the war was over) so that
they'd appear to have fled to Pompey with some sort of gift.  But
then they found that this pretty difficult.  Indeed, they found
no way to accomplish it.  So they borrowed as much money as they
could, as if they wanted to compensate their friends and restore
what they'd embezzled, and after buying many horses they crossed
over to Pompey with the men with whom they had shared their plan.
