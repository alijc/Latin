63.1 Erat eo loco fossa pedum XV et vallum contra hostem in
altitudinem pedum X, tantundemque eius valli agger in latitudinem
patebat: ab eo intermisso spatio pedum DC alter conversus in
contrariam partem erat vallus humiliore paulo munitione.  Hoc
enim superioribus diebus timens Caesar, ne navibus nostri
circumvenirentur, duplicem eo loco fecerat vallum, ut, si
ancipiti proelio dimicaretur, posset resisti.  Sed operum
magnitudo et continens omnium dierum labor, quod milium passuum
in circuitu XVII munitiones erat complexus, perficiendi spatium
non dabat.  Itaque contra mare transversum vallum, qui has duas
munitiones coniungeret, nondum perfecerat.  Quae res nota erat
Pompeio delata per Allobrogas perfugas, magnumque nostris
attulerat incommodum.  Nam ut ad mare duo cohortes nonae legionis
excubuerant, accessere subito prima luce Pompeiani; simul navibus
circumvecti milites in exteriorem vallum tela iaciebant,
fossaeque aggere complebantur, et legionarii interioris
munitionis defensores scalis admotis tormentis cuiusque generis
telisque terrebant, magnaque multitudo sagittariorum ab utraque
parte circumfundebatur.  Multum autem ab ictu lapidum, quod unum
nostris erat telum, viminea tegimenta galeis imposita
defendebant.  Itaque cum omnibus rebus nostri premerentur atque
aegre resisterent animadversum est vitium munitionis, quod supra
demonstratum est, atque inter duos vallos, qua perfectum opus non
erat, Pompeiani navibus expositi in aversos nostros impetum
fecerunt atque ex utraque munitione deiectos terga vertere
coegerunt.


There was a 15 foot deep ditch and a 10 foot high palisade facing
the enemy, with a rampart just as deep as the palisade was
tall: 600 feet away from it was another, lower, palisade turned
the other way.  For in recent days Caesar, fearing that our men
might be surrounded by ships, had built a double wall in this
place, so that a battle could be opposed on two fronts.  But due
to the size of the fortifications and all of the needed labor,
because the fortifications took up a space 17 miles around, there
wasn't enough time for completing the work.  And so he had not
yet completed the flanking palisade that faced the sea and joined
these two fortifications.  And Pompey knew this info, which had
been conveyed by the Allobrogian deserters, and it brought a
great disaster to our men.  For while two cohorts of the ninth
legion had kept watch by the sea, the Pompeians attacked them
unexpectedly at first light; at the same time soldiers traveling
in ships were hurling spears at the outer palisade and filling in
the ditch, and legions had brought ladders up to the inner
fortifications and were terrorizing the defenders with siege
engines and all sorts of projectiles, who were also surrounded by
a great mass of archers by every side.  But their wickerwork
helmet covers did much to ward off the blow of stones, which were
our own sole weapons.  And so when our men were hard pressed by
all this and scarcely holding out, the Pompeians noticed the
defect of the fortifications, which was mentioned above, where
the work was not completed between the two palisades, and
disembarked from their ships and made an assault against our men
from behind and forced them back, dislodging them from both sides
of the fortification.
