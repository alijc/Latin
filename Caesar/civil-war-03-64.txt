64.1 Hoc tumultu nuntiato Marcellinus cohortes subsidio nostris
laborantibus submittit ex castris; quae fugientes conspicatae
neque illos suo adventu confirmare potuerunt neque ipsae hostium
impetum tulerunt.  Itaque quodcumque addebatur subsidii, id
corruptum timore fugientium terrorem et periculum augebat;
hominum enim multitudine receptus impediebatur.  In eo proelio
cum gravi vulnere esset affectus aquilifer et a viribus
deficeretur, conspicatus equites nostros, "hanc ego," inquit, "et
vivus multos per annos magna diligentia defendi et nunc moriens
eadem fide Caesari restituo.  Nolite, obsecro, committere, quod
ante in exercitu Caesaris non accidit, ut rei militaris dedecus
admittatur, incolumemque ad eum deferte."  Hoc casu aquila
conservatur omnibus primae cohortis centurionibus interfectis
praeter principem priorem.

After this tumult was reported, Marcellinus sent out cohorts
from the camp as reinforcements to our suffering men.  But when
they came in sight of the fleeing men, their arrival wasn't
enough to give them courage, nor could they themselves bear the
enemy's assault.  And so whatever relief was added, it, infected
by fear, increased the panic of those fleeing and the danger; for
the retreat was obstructed by the mass of men.  In this battle,
when the standard-bearer was felled by a grave wound and his
strength failed him, he caught sight of our cavalry and said, "I,
living, protected this for many years with great diligence and
now, dying, I faithfully restore it to Caesar.  I beg you, don't
commit the crime that has never before happened in Caesar's army
and allow a military dishonor, and carry it to him safe and
sound."  The standard was preserved from this fate, with all the
centurions of the first cohort killed except for the first
captain of the principes.
