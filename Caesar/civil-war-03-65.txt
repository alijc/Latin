65.1 Iamque Pompeiani magna caede nostrorum castris Marcellini
appropinquabant non mediocri terrore illato reliquis cohortibus,
et M. Antonius, qui proximum locum praesidiorum tenebat, ea re
nuntiata cum cohortibus XII descendens ex loco superiore
cernebatur.  Cuius adventus Pompeianos compressit nostrosque
firmavit, ut se ex maximo timore colligerent.  Neque multo post
Caesar significatione per castella fumo facta, ut erat superioris
temporis consuetudo, deductis quibusdam cohortibus ex praesidiis
eodem venit.  Qui cognito detrimento eum animadvertisset Pompeium
extra munitiones egressum, castra secundum mare munire, ut libere
pabulari posset nec minus aditum navibus haberet, commutata
ratione belli, quoniam propositum non tenuerat, castra iuxta
Pompeium munire iussit.


And now the Pompeians, after a great slaughter of our men, were
nearing Marcellinus' camp, bringing an uncommon panic to the rest
of the cohorts.  When this was reported, M. Antony, who held the
nearest position of the detachments, was seen descending from his
higher position with 12 cohorts.  And at his arrival he pressed
the Pompeians and strengthened our men, so that they rallied out
of their great fear.  And not much later Caesar, after sending a
smoke signal between the redoubts, as was his recent practice,
came to the same place, with some cohorts pulled out of the
detachments.  And after he learned of his losses, and found that
Pompey had gotten out beyond his fortifications and was
fortifying a camp next to the sea, so that he could forage freely
and have a greater approach to his ships, he altered his plan of
war since he had not held his objective, and ordered the camp
nearest to Pompey to be fortified.
