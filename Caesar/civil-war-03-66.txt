66.1 Qua perfecta munitione animadversum est a speculatoribus
Caesaris, cohortes quasdam, quod instar legionis videretur, esse
post silvam et in vetera castra duci.  Castrorum sic situs erat.
Superioribus diebus nona Caesaris legio, cum se obiecisset
Pompeianis copiis atque opere, ut demonstravimus, circummuniret,
castra eo loco posuit.  Haec silvam quandam contingebant neque
longius a mari passibus CCC aberant.  Post mutato consilio
quibusdam de causis Caesar paulo ultra eum locum castra
transtulit, paucisque intermissis diebus eadem Pompeius
occupaverat et, quod eo loco plures erat legiones habiturus,
relicto interiore vallo maiorem adiecerat munitionem.  Ita minora
castra inclusa maioribus castelli atque arcis locum obtinebant.
Item ab angulo castrorum sinistro munitionem ad flumen perduxerat
circiter passus CCCC, quo liberius a periculo milites aquarentur.
Sed is quoque mutato consilio quibusdam de causis, quas
commemorari necesse non est, eo loco excesserat.  Ita complures
dies inania manserant castra; munitiones quidem omnes integrae
erant.


And when this fortification was completed Caesar's scouts
observed that some cohorts, a whole legion it seemed, were
marching behind the woods to the old camp.  The camp was
positioned like this.  In recent days, when Caesar's ninth legion
had opposed Pompey's troops and had built a surrounding
fortification, as we have shown, where they sited their camp.  It
butted up against a forest and was within 300 paces of the sea.
Afterwards, Caesar changed his plans, and for certain reasons
transferred the camp a little beyond that spot, and within a few
days Pompey had captured the same location and, because he was
going to hold more legions in that spot, had raised a larger
fortification, leaving the inner palisade alone.  Thus the
smaller camp, enclosed by the larger redoubt, took the place of a
citadel.  Likewise he had extended the fortification about 400
paces from the left corner of the camp to the river, by which the
soldiers might fetch water with less danger.  But later he also
changed his plans, for reasons that need not be mentioned, and
withdrew from that spot.  Thus for many days the camp had
remained empty; indeed all the fortifications were intact.
