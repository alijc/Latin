67.1 Eo signa legionis illata speculatores Caesari renuntiarunt.
Hoc idem visum ex superioribus quibusdam castellis confirmaverunt.
Is locus aberat a novis Pompei castris circiter passus quingentos.
Hanc legionem sperans Caesar se opprimere posse et cupiens eius
diei detrimentum sarcire, reliquit in opere cohortes duas, quae
speciem munitionis praeberent; ipse diverso itinere quam potuit
occultissime reliquas cohortes, numero XXXIII, in quibus erat
legio nona multis amissis centurionibus deminutoque militum
numero, ad legionem Pompei castraque minora duplici acie eduxit.
Neque eum prima opinio fefellit.  Nam et pervenit prius, quam
Pompeius sentire posset, et tametsi erant munitiones castrorum
magnae, tamen sinistro cornu, ubi erat ipse, celeriter aggressus
Pompeianos ex vallo deturbavit.  Erat obiectus portis ericius.
Hic paulisper est pugnatum, cum irrumpere nostri conarentur, illi
castra defenderent, fortissime T. Pulieone, cuius opera proditum
exercitum C. Antoni demonstravimus, eo loco propugnante.  Sed
tamen nostri virtute vicerunt excisoque ericio primo in maiora
castra, post etiam in castellum, quod erat inclusum maioribus
castris, irruperunt, quo pulsa legio sese receperat, et nonnullos
ibi repugnantes interfecerunt.


The scouts reported to Caesar that the standards of a legion had
been carried there.  They confirmed that the same thing had been
seen from some of the higher redoubts.  The site was about half a
mile away from Pompey's new camp.  Caesar, in hopes that he could
fall upon this legion and desiring to redeem his defeat of the
day, left two cohorts in the fortifications to give it the
appearance of being defended.  He himself led out the rest of the
cohorts, 33 in number, among which was the ninth legion, which had
lost many centurions and a smaller number of soldiers, as covertly
as possible by a roundabout route in a double line towards
Pompey's legion and his smaller camp.  And his first conjecture
didn't disappoint him.  For he not only arrived earlier than
Pompey could realize, but, even though the camp had strong
fortifications, yet with his left wing, where he himself was, he
swiftly attacked Pompey's forces and drove them away from the
palisade.  A spiked beam had been thrown down at the gate.  There
was a brief fight here as our forces attempted to rush in while
they defended their camp, with T. Pulcia, whose act of treachery
against the army of C. Antonius we have described, fighting
valiantly in that spot.  But nevertheless our men courageously
triumphed and after first destroying the spiked beam surged into
the larger camp, and yet later into its enclosed redoubt, into
which the legion had retreated after being driven out of the
larger camp, and killed several who were fighting back there.
