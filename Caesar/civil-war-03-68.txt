68.1 Sed fortuna, quae plurimum potest cum in reliquis rebus tum
praecipue in bello, parvis momentis magnas rerum commutationes
efficit; ut tum accidit.  Munitionem, quam pertinere a castris ad
flumen supra demonstravimus, dextri Caesaris cornu cohortes
ignorantia loci sunt secutae, cum portam quaererent castrorumque
eam munitionem esse arbitrarentur.  Quod cum esset animadversum
coniunctam esse flumini, prorutis munitionibus defendente nullo
transcenderunt, omnisque noster equitatus eas cohortes est
secutus.

But fortune, which has great power, not only in everything else
but especially in war, brings about great alterations in events
through small influences; as then happened.  The rampart, as we
have above shown, extended from the camp to the river.  On
Caesar's right wing the cohorts, through ignorance of the place,
followed it as they searched for a gate, thinking it part of the
camp's fortification.  And when it was found to connect to the
river, they assaulted the rampart and, with no one defending it,
climbed atop it, and all our cavalry followed them.
