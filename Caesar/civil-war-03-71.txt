71.1 Duobus his unius diei proeliis Caesar desideravit milites
DCCCCLX et notos equites Romanos Tuticanum Gallum, senatoris filium,
C. Fleginatem Placentia, A. Granium Puteolis, M. Sacrativirum Capua,
tribunos militum et centuriones XXXII; sed horum omnium pars magna
in fossis munitionibusque et fluminis ripis oppressa suorum in
terrore ac fuga sine ullo vulnere interiit; signaque sunt militaria
amissa XXXII.  Pompeius eo proelio imperator est appellatus.  Hoc
nomen obtinuit atque ita se postea salutari passus est, sed neque in
litteris scribere est solitus, neque in fascibus insignia laureae
praetulit.  At Labienus, cum ab eo impetravisset, ut sibi captivos
tradi iuberet, omnes productos ostentationis, ut videbatur, causa,
quo maior perfugae fides haberetur, commilitones appellans et magna
verborum contumelia interrogans, solerentne veterani milites fugere,
in omnium conspectu interfecit.


In these two battles in a single day Caesar lost 960 soldiers and
the noted Roman knights Tutucanus Gallus, a senator's son,
C. Fleginus of Placentia, A. Granius of Puteoli, M. Sacrativirus
from Capua, and 32 military tribunes and centurions.  A great many
of all these were trampled in trenches and fortifications and and on
river banks by their panicked and fleeing comrades and perished
without any wound, and 32 military standards were lost.  As a result
of this battle Pompey was called Conqueror.  He kept this title and
afterwards allowed himself to be so saluted, but was not in the
habit of writing it in letters, nor did he display this laurel in
his insignia of consulship.  But Labienus, after he talked Pompey
into handing the prisoners over to him and had led them all out on
display to show, with good reason, how well the faith of a deserter
should be held, calling them fellows and with a torrent of abusive
speeches, asking if it was the norm for experienced soldiers to
flee, he had them all killed in his sight.
