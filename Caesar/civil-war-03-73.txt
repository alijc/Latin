73.1 Caesar a superioribus consiliis depulsus omnem sibi
commutandam belli rationem existimavit.  Itaque uno tempore
praesidiis omnibus deductis et oppugnatione dimissa coactoque in
unum locum exercitu contionem apud milites habuit hortatusque
est, ne ea, quae accidissent, graviter ferrent neve his rebus
terrerentur multisque secundis proeliis unum adversum et id
mediocre opponerent.  Habendam fortunae gratiam, quod Italiam
sine aliquo vulnere cepissent, quod duas Hispanias
bellicosissimorum hominum peritissimis atque exercitatissimis
ducibus pacavissent, quod finitimas frumentariasque provincias in
potestatem redegissent; denique recordari debere, qua felicitate
inter medias hostium classes oppletis non solum portibus, sed
etiam litoribus omnes incolumes essent transportati.  Si non
omnia caderent secunda, fortunam esse industria sublevandam.
Quod esset acceptum detrimenti, cuiusvis potius quam suae culpae
debere tribui.  Locum se aequum ad dimicandum dedisse, potitum
esse hostium castris, expulisse ac superasse pugnantes.  Sed sive
ipsorum perturbatio sive error aliquis sive etiam fortuna partam
iam praesentemque victoriam interpellavisset, dandam omnibus
operam, ut acceptum incommodum virtute sarciretur.  Quod si esset
factum, futurum, uti ad Gergoviam contigisset, ut detrimentum in
bonum verteret, atque qui ante dimicare timuissent, ultro se
proelio offerrent.


After Caesar was forced to abandon his most recent resolutions,
he saw the need to completely revamp his plan of battle.  And so
he pulled back his forces and called off the assault at once, and
gathering the army into an assembly he passed among the the
soldiers and exhorted them not to suffer the previous events too
heavily nor to be frightened by them, and to offset their single
reverse, and that a minor one, with their many favorable battles.
He told them that they had Fortune's favor, because they'd taken
Italia without bloodshed, because they'd subdued the two Spains,
with its fierce men and very experienced and well-trained
leaders, because they'd reduced the neighboring grain-producing
provinces to their power; and finally, that they ought to
remember the good fortune that had transported them safely in the
midst of the enemy fleets, which had filled up not only the
harbors, but the shores as well.  That, even if not everything
that had befallen them had gone well, fortune would assist them
through their hard work.  That they should attribute the loss
that they'd received to something other than their own failure.
That he'd given them a level field for the fight, that they'd
gained possession of the enemy's camp, and had driven out and
defeated those defending it.  But whether some confusion of
theirs or any error or even fortune itself had obstructed the
budding victory that was already in view, they all must needs
take on the task to redeem, through their courage, the damage
that they'd taken.  If anything might be done to turn this defeat
to the good, it would be, as had happened at Gergovia, where
those who had been afraid to fight before, offered battle of
their own accord.
