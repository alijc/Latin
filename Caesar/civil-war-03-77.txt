77.1 Postero die Caesar similiter praemissis prima nocte
impedimentis de quarta vigilia ipse egreditur, ut, si qua esset
imposita dimicandi necessitas, subitum casum expedito exercitu
subiret.  Hoc idem reliquis fecit diebus.  Quibus rebus perfectum
est, ut altissimis fluminibus atque impeditissimis itineribus nullum
acciperet incommodum.  Pompeius primi diei mora illata et reliquorum
dierum frustra labore suscepto, cum se magnis itineribus extenderet
et praegressos consequi cuperet, quarto die finem sequendi fecit
atque aliud sibi consilium capiendum existimavit.


The next day, in like fashion, after sending the baggage ahead early
in the night, Caesar marched off himself around the fourth watch, so
that, if any need for fighting were laid on him, he'd weather what
befell him with an unencumbered army.  He did the same thing on the
remaining days.  And through these means it was brought about that
they took on the deepest rivers and the most difficult marches with
no losses.  After the delay thrust upon Pompey on the first day and
the fruitless toil undertaken on the remaining days, as he extended
himself with long marches, desiring to pursue those who'd
outstripped him, he brought the pursuit to an end on the fourth day,
and considered for himself another plan for catching up.
