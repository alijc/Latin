84.1 Re frumentaria praeparata confirmatisque militibus et satis longo
spatio temporis a Dyrrachinis proeliis intermisso, quo satis perspectum
habere militum animum videretur, temptandum Caesar existimavit, quidnam
Pompeius propositi aut voluntatis ad dimicandum haberet.  Itaque
exercitum ex castris eduxit aciemque instruxit, primum suis locis
pauloque a castris Pompei longius, continentibus vero diebus, ut
progrederetur a castris suis collibusque Pompeianis aciem subiceret.
Quae res in dies confirmatiorem eius exercitum efficiebat.  Superius
tamen institutum in equitibus, quod demonstravimus, servabat, ut,
quoniam numero multis partibus esset inferior, adulescentes atque
expeditos ex antesignanis electis ad pernicitatem armis inter equites
proeliari iuberet, qui cotidiana consuetudine usum quoque eius generis
proeliorum perciperent.  His erat rebus effectum, ut equitum mille
etiam apertioribus locis VII milium Pompeianorum impetum, cum adesset
usus, sustinere auderent neque magnopere eorum multitudine terrerentur.
Namque etiam per eos dies proelium secundum equestre fecit atque unum
Allobrogem ex duobus, quos perfugisse ad Pompeium supra docuimus, cum
quibusdam interfecit.


After his provisions had been prepared and his soldiers were recovered,
and when enough time had passed since the Dyrrachinian battles for him
to get a sense of the soldiers' spirit, Caesar decided to test if
Pompey had the will or means for combat.  And so he led the army out of
camp and drew up his battle array, at first a little way from his own
positions and further from Pompey's camp, over the course of the next
days, he advanced from his camp and placed his line below Pompey's high
ground.  Which made his army more confident during those days.  Because
he was greatly out-numbered in regards his cavalry, he still held to
his most recent plan, as we have shown, so that he ordered that young
and lightly armed men from the lead troops, selected for their agility
with arms, should fight among the horsemen, and through daily practice
they learned to make use of this sort of combat.  This had the effect
that on open ground a mere thousand horsemen, once they had this skill,
endeavored to sustain the attack of 7000 of Pompey's, and were not
overly cowed by their great number.  Indeed, during those days the
cavalry engaged in another battle and killed one of the two
Allobrogians who'd deserted to Pompey, as we described above, along
with a few others.
