85.1 Pompeius, qui castra in colle habebat, ad infimas radices
montis aciem instruebat semper, ut videbatur, exspectans, si
iniquis locis Caesar se subiceret.  Caesar nulla ratione ad pugnam
elici posse Pompeium existimans hanc sibi commodissimam belli
rationem iudicavit, uti castra ex eo loco moveret semperque esset
in itineribus, haec spectans, ut movendis castris pluribusque
adeundis locis commodiore re frumentaria uteretur, simulque in
itinere ut aliquam occasionem dimicandi nancisceretur et insolitum
ad laborem Pompei exercitum cotidianis itineribus defatigaret.
His constitutis rebus, signo iam profectionis dato tabernaculisque
detensis animadversum est paulo ante extra cotidianam
consuetudinem longius a vallo esse aciem Pompei progressam, ut non
iniquo loco posse dimicari videretur.  Tum Caesar apud suos, cum
iam esset agmen in portis, "differendum est" inquit, "iter in
praesentia nobis et de proelio cogitandum, sicut semper
depoposcimus; animo simus ad dimicandum parati: non facile
occasionem postea reperiemus"; confestimque expeditas copias
educit.


Pompey, who had his camp on a hill-top, would always draw his
battle line up at the foot of the mountain, seemingly waiting to
see if Caesar would put himself into a disadvantageous position.
Caesar figured that there was no way to draw Pompey out into
battle and decided on this as the most suitable plan of war for
himself - to shift the camp from that position and to be aways on
the move, considering that by shifting the camp and attacking many
locations, he'd enjoy a better grain supply, and at the same time
would get some chance for fighting on the march, and that Pompey's
army, unaccustomed to hardship, would be exhausted by daily
marches.  When these matters had been arranged and the signal of
departure was already given and the tents were struck, it was
noticed that Pompey's line had, shortly before, advanced further
from his rampart, opposed to his daily habit, so that it seemed
possible to fight on more even ground.  Then, when the column was
already at the gate, Caesar said, in the presence of his men, "Our
march must needs be postponed for now, and thought given to
battle, as we have always demanded.  Let us be ready for battle in
our hearts: we'll not soon get another such opportunity".  And,
leaving the baggage train, he led his forces out at once.
