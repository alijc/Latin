95.1 Caesar Pompeianis ex fuga intra vallum compulsis nullum spatium
perterritis dari oportere existimans milites cohortatus est, ut
beneficio fortunae uterentur castraque oppugnarent.  Qui, etsi magno
aestu fatigati (nam ad meridiem res erat perducta), tamen ad omnem
laborem animo parati imperio paruerunt.  Castra a cohortibus, quae
ibi praesidio erant relictae, industrie defendebantur, multo etiam
acrius a Thracibus barbarisque auxiliis.  Nam qui acie refugerant
milites, et animo perterriti et lassitudine confecti, missis
plerique armis signisque militaribus, magis de reliqua fuga quam de
castrorum defensione cogitabant.  Neque vero diutius, qui in vallo
constiterant, multitudinem telorum sustinere potuerunt, sed confecti
vulneribus locum reliquerunt, protinusque omnes ducibus usi
centurionibus tribunisque militum in altissimos montes, qui ad
castra pertinebant, confugerunt.


After Pompey's fleeing troops had been driven within their ramparts,
Caesar exhorted his soldiers, thinking it needful that the panicked
men be given no breathing space, to make use of fortune's favor and
attack the camp.  And although wearied with the great heat (for the
battle had lasted til midday), they nevertheless readily obeyed the
order for each task with spirit.  The camp was vigorously defended
by the cohorts that had been left there as a garrison, and even more
bitterly by the Thracians and barbarian auxiliaries.  But the
soldiers who had fled from the front line, terrified at heart and
done in by fatigue, with most of their arms and military standards
thrown away, were thinking more about continuing thier flight than
about defending the camp.  And indeed, those who had made a stand
inside the ramparts could not long sustain the great number of
missiles, but, done in by their wounds, abandoned their position, and
at once everyone who had reached the camp, managed by their
commanders, centurions and military tribunes, fled into the highest
mountains.
