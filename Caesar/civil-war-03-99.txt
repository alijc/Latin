99.1 In eo proelio non amplius CC milites desideravit, sed
centuriones, fortes viros, circiter XXX amisit.  Interfectus est
etiam fortissime pugnans Crastinus, cuius mentionem supra
fecimus, gladio in os adversum coniecto.  Neque id fuit falsum,
quod ille in pugnam proficiscens dixerat.  Sic enim Caesar
existimabat, eo proelio excellentissimam virtutem Crastini
fuisse, optimeque eum de se meritum iudicabat.  Ex Pompeiano
exercitu circiter milia XV cecidisse videbantur, sed in
deditionem venerunt amplius milia XXIIII (namque etiam cohortes,
quae praesidio in castellis fuerant, sese Sullae dediderunt),
multi praeterea in finitimas civitates refugerunt; signaque
militaria ex proelio ad Caesarem sunt relata CLXXX et aquilae
VIIII.  L. Domitius ex castris in montem refugiens, cum vires
eum lassitudine defecissent, ab equitibus est interfectus.


In this battle he lost no more than 200 soldiers, but he lost
about 30 centurions, brave men.  Crastinus, of whom we've made
mention above, fought most courageously and was also killed,
with a sword flung into his mouth.  And what he had said in
setting out to fight wasn't untrue.  For in this way Caesar
thought that Crastinus' courage in the battle had been most
excellent, and he judged that he himself deserved him great
credit.  Out of Pompey's army about 15 thousand appeared to have
fallen, but more than 24 thousand came to surrender (indeed,
even the cohorts that had been garrisoned in the towns
surrendered to Sulla).  Besides these, many fled to the
neighboring cities; and 180 military standards and 9 eagles from
the battle were tendered to Caesar.  L. Domitius fled from camp
towards a mountain, but after his strength ebbed and he was overcome
by exhaustion, he was killed by the cavalry.
