II. fletus passeris Lesbiae

Passer, deliciae meae puellae,
quicum ludere, quem in sinu tenere,
cui primum digitum dare appetenti
et acris solet incitare morsus,
cum desiderio meo nitenti
carum nescio quid lubet iocari
et solaciolum sui doloris,
credo ut tum gravis acquiescat ardor:
tecum ludere sicut ipsa possem
et tristis animi levare curas!

IIb.

Tam gratum est mihi quam ferunt puellae
pernici aureolum fuisse malum,
quod zonam soluit diu ligatam. 


II The lament for Lesbia's sparrow

O sparrow, my dear sweetheart's pet,
with whom she's wont to play, hold in her breast,
and to whom she gives her finger-tip
and spurs sharp pecks,
when it pleases her, radiant with my desire,
to jest I know not what dear thing
and some small comfort for her grief,
I trust her painful love might rest:
if only I, like her, could play with you 
and comfort the sad worries of my soul.

It is as pleasing to me, as they say, as
the golden apple was for the swift maid,
that loosened her long-fastened belt.
