III. fletus passeris Lesbiae

Lugete, o Veneres Cupidinesque,
et quantum est hominum venustiorum:
passer mortuus est meae puellae,
passer, deliciae meae puellae,
quem plus illa oculis suis amabat.
nam mellitus erat suamque norat
ipsam tam bene quam puella matrem,
nec sese a gremio illius movebat,
sed circumsiliens modo huc modo illuc
ad solam dominam usque pipiabat.
qui nunc it per iter tenebricosum
illuc, unde negant redire quemquam.
at vobis male sit, malae tenebrae
Orci, quae omnia bella devoratis:
tam bellum mihi passerem abstulistis
o factum male! o miselle passer!
tua nunc opera meae puellae
flendo turgiduli rubent ocelli.

Mourn, O Venuses and Cupids,
and all those most tasteful men!
My sweetheart's sparrow has passed away,
a sparrow, my sweetheart's pet,
that she loved more than her own eyes.
For it was honey-sweet and knew my sweetheart
as well as a girl knows her own mother.
It wouldn't move from her lap,
but hopping about here and there
it chirped to its mistress alone.
And it now passes along the shadowy way
to that place from whence they say that no one returns.
But may it be ill for you, evil shadows
of Hell, that devour all things fair:
you have borne away from me a pretty sparrow.
O foul deed! O wretched sparrow!
Now for thy care my sweetheart's
darling eyes are puffed and red with tears.
