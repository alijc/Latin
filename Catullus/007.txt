VII. ad Lesbiam

Quaeris, quot mihi basiationes
tuae, Lesbia, sint satis superque.
quam magnus numerus Libyssae harenae
lasarpiciferis iacet Cyrenis
oraclum Iovis inter aestuosi
et Batti veteris sacrum sepulcrum;
aut quam sidera multa, cum tacet nox,
furtivos hominum vident amores:
tam te basia multa basiare
vesano satis et super Catullo est,
quae nec pernumerare curiosi
possint nec mala fascinare lingua. 


To Lesbia

You ask, how many of your kisses,
Lesbia, would be enough and more for me.
As many as the number of grains of Saharan sand
that lie in Cyrene (where silphium grows)
between the oracle of sultry Jupiter
and the sacred tomb of ancient Battus;
or as many as the stars, when night is still,
that see the secret loves of men.
To give that many kisses to you 
is enough and more for mad Catullus,
that prying eyes couldn't count them up
or cast a spell with a wicked tongue.
