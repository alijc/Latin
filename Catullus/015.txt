XV. ad Aurelium

Commendo tibi me ac meos amores,
Aureli. veniam peto pudentem,
ut, si quicquam animo tuo cupisti,
quod castum expeteres et integellum,
conserves puerum mihi pudice,
non dico a populo—nihil veremur
istos, qui in platea modo huc modo illuc
in re praetereunt sua occupati—
verum a te metuo tuoque pene
infesto pueris bonis malisque.
quem tu qua lubet, ut lubet moveto
quantum vis, ubi erit foris paratum:
hunc unum excipio, ut puto, pudenter.
quod si te mala mens furorque vecors
in tantam impulerit, sceleste, culpam,
ut nostrum insidiis caput lacessas.
a tum te miserum malique fati!
quem attractis pedibus patente porta
percurrent raphanique mugilesque.

I commend myself and my love to you,
Aurelius.  I beg a modest favor,
that, if you ever desired ought for your soul
that you wished pure and untouched,
you might chastely guard a boy for me.
Not from people, mind you - we aren't afraid of
those who pass by in the street
hither and thither, lost in their own affairs.
In truth I am afraid of you and your prick,
unsafe for boys, good or bad.
Which you will shake, wherever and whenever it pleases,
as much as you want, whenever it is out and ready:
I exclude this one boy, honorably enough, I think.
But if an evil mind and frenzied madness
so urge you on to crime, wicked man,
to assail our head with treachery,
then you, you wretch of evil doom,
when with your feet bound, through your open door
run both radishes and mullets.
