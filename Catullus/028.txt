XXVIII. ad Verannium et Fabullum

Pisonis comites, cohors inanis,
aptis sarcinulis et expeditis,
Verani optime tuque mi Fabulle,
quid rerum geritis? satisne cum isto
vappa frigoraque et famem tulistis?
ecquidnam in tabulis patet lucelli
expensum, ut mihi, qui meum secutus
praetorem refero datum lucello?
"o Memmi, bene me ac diu supinum
tota ista trabe lentus irrumasti."
sed, quantum video, pari fuistis
casu: nam nihilo minore verpa
farti estis. pete nobiles amicos!
at vobis mala multa di deaeque
dent, opprobria Romuli Remique.


XXVIII. to Veranius and Fabullus

Piso's retinue, destitute attendants,
with a lightly loaded pouch tied up,
most excellent Veranius, and you my Fabullus,
how goes it with you?  Have you borne enough 
winter frosts and hunger 
with that good-for-nothing of yours?
For is any slim profit at all laid out in your account books?
As for me, when I followed my own
governor, I made a little bit on it.
"O Memmius, you screwed me, bent over backwards, 
long and hard with the full length of your shaft."
But, as I see it, you both were equal to me
in prospects: for with no smaller woody
have you been rammed.  Entreat your noble friends!
But may the gods and goddesses give them many woes,
Romulus' and Remus' disgrace.
