XXXI. ad Sirmium insulam

Paene insularum, Sirmio, insularumque
ocelle, quascumque in liquentibus stagnis
marique vasto fert uterque Neptunus,
quam te libenter quamque laetus inviso,
vix mi ipse credens Thuniam atque Bithunos
liquisse campos et videre te in tuto.
o quid solutis est beatius curis,
cum mens onus reponit, ac peregrino
labore fessi venimus larem ad nostrum,
desideratoque acquiescimus lecto?
hoc est quod unum est pro laboribus tantis.
salve, o venusta Sirmio, atque ero gaude
gaudente, vosque, o Lydiae lacus undae,
ridete quidquid est domi cachinnorum.

XXXI. to the Isle of Sirmio

O Sirmio, of near-islands and of islands
the gem, which, whether in clear lagoons
or in the vast sea, Neptune bears,
How joyfully and how gladly I gaze on you,
scarcely believing that I've left the Thynian and Bithynian
fields behind and see you safe and secure.
O, what is more blessed than to be freed from cares,
when the mind lays down its burden, and we,
wearied with toil from foreign parts, come to our hearth,
and repose on our longed-for bed?
This is that one thing that befits such labors.
Hail, O lovely Sirmio, and rejoice for your rejoicing
master, and you, O Lydian waves of the lake,
laugh whatever guffaws there are at home.
