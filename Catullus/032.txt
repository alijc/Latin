XXXII. ad Ipsicillam

Amabo, mea dulcis Ipsitilla,
meae deliciae, mei lepores,
iube ad te veniam meridiatum.
et si iusseris, illud adiuvato,
ne quis liminis obseret tabellam,
neu tibi lubeat foras abire,
sed domi maneas paresque nobis
novem continuas fututiones.
verum si quid ages, statim iubeto:
nam pransus iaceo et satur supinus
pertundo tunicamque palliumque.

XXXII. to Ipsitilla

Please, my delightful Ipsitilla,
my darling, my charmer,
command me to come to you for a midday nap.
And if you so command, then encourage it,
that no one should bolt the door,
and that it doesn't please you to go abroad,
but bide you at home and make ready
nine continuous fucks for us.
For sure, if you're going to do anything, command it at once:
for I'm lying at lunch and am full, flat on my back
poking through both tunic and cloak.
