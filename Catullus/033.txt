XXXIII. ad Vibennios

O Furum optime balneariorum
Vibenni pater et cinaede fili
(nam dextra pater inquinatiore,
culo filius est voraciore),
cur non exilium malasque in oras
itis? quandoquidem patris rapinae
notae sunt populo, et natis pilosas,
fili, non potes asse venditare.


XXXIII. to the Vibenniuses

O you best of bathhouse thieves
old man Vibennius and his pansy son
(for the father is nastier with his hand,
and the son greedier with his asshole),
why aren't you two off into exile on evil shores?
Seeing how the father's thefts
are well known to the people, and your hairy buttcheeks,
kiddo, you can't auction off for a penny.
