XXXIV. carmen Dianae

Dianae sumus in fide
puellae et pueri integri:
Dianam pueri integri
puellaeque canamus.

o Latonia, maximi
magna progenies Iovis,
quam mater prope Deliam
deposiuit olivam,

montium domina ut fores
silvarumque virentium
saltuumque reconditorum
amniumque sonantum:

tu Lucina dolentibus
Iuno dicta puerperis,
tu potens Trivia et notho es
dicta lumine Luna.

tu cursu, dea, menstruo
metiens iter annuum,
rustica agricolae bonis
tecta frugibus exples.

sis quocumque tibi placet
sancta nomine, Romulique,
antique ut solita es, bona
sospites ope gentem.


XXXIV. song/prayer to Diana

We're in Diana's trust
the chaste lads and lasses:
the chaste lads and lasses
let us praise Diana in song.

O Latonia, the great offspring
of most great Jove,
whom your mother bore on Delos
under an olive tree,

so that you might be mistress of the mountains
and of the green forests
and of the hidden glades
and of the echoing streams:

you are called Lucina Juno
by women travailing in labor,
you are called mighty Trivia and Luna
by the bastard light.

You, goddess, with the monthly course
that measures the yearly journey,
you fill up farmer's rustic barns
with healthful crops.

May you be sanctified by whatever 
name pleases you, as is your wont of old,
may you preserve 
the race of Romulus with your good aid.
