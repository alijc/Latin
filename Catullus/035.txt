XXXV. ad Caecilium iubet libello loqui

Poetae tenero, meo sodali,
velim Caecilio, papyre, dicas
Veronam veniat, Noui relinquens
Comi moenia Lariumque litus.
nam quasdam volo cogitationes
amici accipiat sui meique.
quare, si sapiet, viam vorabit,
quamvis candida milies puella
euntem revocet, manusque collo
ambas iniciens roget morari.
quae nunc, si mihi vera nuntiantur,
illum deperit impotente amore.
nam quo tempore legit incohatam
Dindymi dominam, ex eo misellae
ignes interiorem edunt medullam.
ignosco tibi, Sapphica puella
musa doctior; est enim venuste
Magna Caecilio incohata Mater.

XXXV. to Caecilius, to whom he commands a booklet to speak

O paper, I wish you'd tell the tender poet,
my comrade Caecilius, 
to come to Verona, leaving behind
the walls of New Comum and the shores of Larius.
For I wish that he would receive
some deliberations from a friend of his and mine.
Therefore, if he has sense, he'll devour the road,
even though his fair lass might call
the traveller back a thousand times, and flinging
both hands around his neck, beg him to delay.
Who now, if the truth be told to me,
is dying for him in helpless love.
For from the time that she read the rough draft
of the Lady of Dindymus, flames consume 
the wretched woman's inmost marrow.
I forgive you, lass, wiser than the muse Sappho;
for the Great Mother has been
beautifully begun by Caecilius.
