XXXVI. ad Lusi cacatam

Annales Volusi, cacata carta,
votum soluite pro mea puella.
nam sanctae Veneri Cupidinique
vovit, si sibi restitutus essem
desissemque truces vibrare iambos,
electissima pessimi poetae
scripta tardipedi deo daturam
infelicibus ustulanda lignis.
et hoc pessima se puella vidit
iocose lepide vovere divis.
nunc o caeruleo creata ponto,
quae sanctum Idalium Vriosque apertos
quaeque Ancona Cnidumque harundinosam
colis quaeque Amathunta quaeque Golgos
quaeque Durrachium Hadriae tabernam,
acceptum face redditumque votum,
si non illepidum neque invenustum est.
at vos interea venite in ignem,
pleni ruris et inficetiarum.
annales Volusi, cacata carta.

XXXVI. to the crappy (book?) of Lusius

O you annals of Volusius, you crappy pages,
discharge a vow for my lass.
For to sacred Venus and Cupid
she pledged, that if I was restored to her
and left off brandishing savage meters,
then the choicest writings of the worst poet
would be rendered to the slow-footed god
to be charred by inauspicious firewood.
And the most wretched lass saw that she
did jokingly and wittily vow this to the gods.
Now you who were created from the cerulean sea,
who the sacred Idalium and storm-thrashed Urium
and Ancona and Cnidum full of reeds
does inhabit, and Amathunta and Golgos
and the Adriatic Durrachium inn,
discharge the account and repay the vow,
if it's not without grace and not unattractive.
But meanwhile, come ye into the fire,
full of the farm and crudity.
you annals of Volusius, you crappy pages.
