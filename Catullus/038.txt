XXXVIII. ad Cornificium

Malest, Cornifici, tuo Catullo
malest, me hercule, et laboriose,
et magis magis in dies et horas.
quem tu, quod minimum facillimumque est,
qua solatus es allocutione?
irascor tibi. sic meos amores?
paulum quid lubet allocutionis,
maestius lacrimis Simonideis.

XXXVIII. to Cornificius

It's dire, Cornificius, for your Catullus,
It's dire for me, by Hercules, and rough,
and worse and worse each day and hour.
Why didn't you, for it's a small and easy thing,
solace me with consoling words?
I'm angry with you.  Thus for my love?
A snippet of consoling words would please,
though sadder than Simonides' tears.
