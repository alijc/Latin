XLVIII. ad Iuventium
Mellitos oculos tuos, Iuventi,
si quis me sinat usque basiare,
usque ad milia basiem trecenta
nec numquam videar satur futurus,
non si densior aridis aristis
sit nostrae seges osculationis.

XLVIII. to Juventius

Your honeyed eyes, Juventius,
if someone'd let me kiss them all the time,
all the way to three hundred thousand times
never would I feel I'd had enough,
not even if denser than sheaves of wheat
was our crop of kisses.
