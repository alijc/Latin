IL. ad Marcum Tullium Ciceronem

Disertissime Romuli nepotum,
quot sunt quotque fuere, Marce Tulli,
quotque post aliis erunt in annis,
gratias tibi maximas Catullus
agit pessimus omnium poeta,
tanto pessimus omnium poeta,
quanto tu optimus omnium patronus.

IL. to Marcus Tullius Cicero

Most eloquent descendant of Romulus,
no matter how many there are and how many there were, Marcus Tullius,
and how many others will be in years to come,
Catullus, the worst poet of them all,
gives the greatest thanks to you.
He is as much the worst poet of them all,
as you are the best of all patrons.
