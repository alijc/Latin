LXX.

Nulli se dicit mulier mea nubere malle
quam mihi, non si se Iuppiter ipse petat.
dicit: sed mulier cupido quod dicit amanti,
in vento et rapida scribere oportet aqua.

My woman says that she'd wish to be married to no one
other than me, even if Jupiter himself were to ask her.
So she says: but what a woman says to her loving sweetheart,
ought to be written on the wind and the running water.
