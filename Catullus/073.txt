LXXIII.

Desine de quoquam quicquam bene velle mereri
aut aliquem fieri posse putare pium.
omnia sunt ingrata, nihil fecisse benigne
prodest immo etiam taedet obestque magis;
ut mihi, quem nemo gravius nec acerbius urget,
quam modo qui me unum atque unicum amicum habuit.

Leave off wishing that anything is well deserved by anyone
or thinking that anyone can be grateful.
Everything is thankless, no kind deeds are done.
No, indeed, it disgusts and injures me all the more;
as, whom no one presses me more gravely or more bitterly,
than he who had his one and only friend in me.
