74. ad Gellium 

Gellius audierat patruum obiurgare solere,
si quis delicias diceret aut faceret.
hoc ne ipsi accideret, patrui perdepsuit ipsam
uxorem, et patruum reddidit Arpocratem.
quod voluit fecit: nam, quamvis irrumet ipsum
nunc patruum, verbum non faciet patruus.  

To Gellius

Gellius had heard that his uncle was wont to scold,
if anyone made love in word or deed.
To keep this from happening to himself, he shagged his uncle's
wife herself, and rendered his uncle speechless.
He did what he wanted: for, even if he humps 
his uncle now, his uncle won't say a word.
