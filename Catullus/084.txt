LXXXIV. ad Arrium

Chommoda dicebat, si quando commoda vellet
dicere, et insidias Arrius hinsidias,
et tum mirifice sperabat se esse locutum,
cum quantum poterat dixerat hinsidias.
credo, sic mater, sic liber avunculus eius.
sic maternus avus dixerat atque avia.
hoc misso in Syriam requierant omnibus aures
audibant eadem haec leniter et leviter,
nec sibi postilla metuebant talia verba,
cum subito affertur nuntius horribilis,
Ionios fluctus, postquam illuc Arrius isset,
iam non Ionios esse sed Hionios.

To Arrius

Whenever Arrius wanted to say 'advantage', he'd say
'hadvantage', and 'hambush' for 'ambush',
and then trusted that he'd spoken wonderfully,
as he'd said 'hambush' as loudly as he could.
I believe that his mother, his uncle the freedman,
and his mother's grandfather had spoken thus, and her grandmother too.
After he was sent to Syria everyone's ears got a respite
as they heard those same words gently and softly,
and after that they didn't dread those words so much.
Then suddenly an awful message is brought,
the Ionian Sea, after Arrius had gone there,
no longer was Ionian, but now was Hionian.
