LXXXVII. ad Lesbiam

Nulla potest mulier tantum se dicere amatam
     vere, quantum a me Lesbia amata mea est.
nulla fides ullo fuit umquam foedere tanta,
     quanta in amore tuo ex parte reperta mea est.

LXXXVII. to Lesbia

No woman can truly much call herself beloved
   as much as my Lesbia was beloved by me.
There's never been such faith in any pact
   as was found on my part in your love.
