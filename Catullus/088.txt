LXXXVIII. ad Gellium

Quid facit is, Gelli, qui cum matre atque sorore
     prurit, et abiectis pervigilat tunicis?
quid facit is, patruum qui non sinit esse maritum?
     ecquid scis quantum suscipiat sceleris?
suscipit, o Gelli, quantum non ultima Tethys
     nec genitor Nympharum abluit Oceanus:
nam nihil est quicquam sceleris, quo prodeat ultra,
     non si demisso se ipse voret capite.

LXXXVIII, to Gellius

What is he doing, Gellius, who is aroused by his mother and sister,
   and stays up all night with his underclothes thrown off?
What is he doing, who doesn't allow his uncle to be married?
   Do you have any idea how much wickedness he takes on?
He takes on, Gellius, so much that neither furthest Tethys
   or Ocean, the father of the Nymphs, can wash it away:
for there is no wickedness he wouldn't surmount,
   not even if he were to swallow himself with his lowered head.
