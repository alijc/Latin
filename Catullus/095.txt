XCV. ad Gaium Helvium Cinnam

Zmyrna mei Cinnae nonam post denique messem
     quam coepta est nonamque edita post hiemem,
milia cum interea quingenta Hortensius uno
     * * * * * * * * 
Zmyrna cavas Satrachi penitus mittetur ad undas,
     Zmyrnam cana diu saecula pervoluent.
at Volusi annales Paduam morientur ad ipsam
     et laxas scombris saepe dabunt tunicas.

XCVb.

Parva mei mihi sint cordi monimenta ...,
     at populus tumido gaudeat Antimacho.


XCV. to Gaius Helvius Cinna

At last my Cinna's 'Zmyrna' has been published,
   nine harvests and nine winters after it was begun,
while Hortensius wrote thousands upon thousands in a single...
   ******

'Zmyrna' will be sent far inland to the hollow waves of the River Satrax,
  they'll reread 'Zmyrna' for long hoary ages.
But the annals of Volusius will die at Padua itself
   and will often provide loose wrappings for mackerels.

XCVb.

Let the short writings of my companion stay in my heart,
   but let the mob delight in bombastic Antimachus.
