XCVII. ad Aemilium

Non (ita me di ament) quicquam referre putavi,
     utrumne os an culum olfacerem Aemilio.
nilo mundius hoc, nihiloque immundius illud,
     verum etiam culus mundior et melior:
nam sine dentibus est. hic dentis sesquipedalis,
     gingivas vero ploxeni habet veteris,
praeterea rictum qualem diffissus in aestu
     meientis mulae cunnus habere solet.
hic futuit multas et se facit esse venustum,
     et non pistrino traditur atque asino?
quem siqua attingit, non illam posse putemus
     aegroti culum lingere carnificis?

XCVII. to Aemilius

I did not (so may the gods love me) think to report anything,
   whether it was Aemilius' mouth or his butt that I smelled.
The first is by no means fouler, or the second cleaner,
   in truth his butt is cleaner and better:
for it has no teeth.  His mouth has teeth, a foot and a half long,
   and gums truly like an ancient wagonbox,
moreover a pissing she-mule's vulva, split open in her heat,
   is wont to have that sort of gaping mouth.
He's had sex with many women and makes himself seem charming,
   and is not handed over to the ass's workhouse?
And if any women touches him, wouldn't we think that she could
   lick a sick hangman's butt?
