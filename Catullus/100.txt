C. ad Marcum Caelium furum

Caelius Aufillenum et Qvintius Aufillenam
     flos Veronensum depereunt iuvenum,
hic fratrem, ille sororem. hoc est, quod dicitur, illud
     fraternum vere dulce sodalicium.
cui faveam potius? Caeli, tibi: nam tua nobis
     perspecta ex igni est unica amicitia,
cum vesana meas torreret flamma medullas.
     sis felix, Caeli, sis in amore potens.

C. to Marcus Caelius of the thieves

Caelius and Quintius, the flower of the youth of Verona,
     are dying for love for the Aufilleni,
one the brother, and the other the sister.  This is indeed, as they say, 
     such delightful brotherly fellowship.
Whom should I favor more?  You, Caelius: for your uncommon friendship
     towards us was observed out of passion,
when a frenzied flame roasted my inmost parts.
     May you be happy, Caelius, may you be strong in love.
