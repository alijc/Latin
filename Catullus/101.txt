FRATER AVE, ATQUE VALE.

MultAs per gentEs et multa per aequora vectus
 adveniO hAs miserAs, frAter, ad InferiAs,
ut tE postrEmO dOnArem mUnere mortis
 et mUtam nEquIquam adloquerer cinerem,
quandoquidem fortUna mihI tEtE abstulit ipsum,
 heu miser indignE frAter adempte mihI.
Nunc tamen intereA haec, prIscO quae mOre parentum
 Tradita sunt trIstI mUnere ad InferiAs,
accipe frAternO multum mAnantia flEtU,
 atque in perpetuum, frAter, avE atque vAle.

Greetings, brother, and farewell

Borne through many nations and over many seas,
 I come, brother, for these doleful funeral offerings,
so that I might present you with the final gifts of death 
 and address your silent ashes in vain,
since fate has taken you yourself from me,
 alas, poor brother unjustly carried away from me.
But now accept these gifts, that by our forefathers' ancient custom 
 were given as a mourning gift for funeral offerings,
with a brother's much-flowing tears 
 and forever, brother, greetings and farewell.
