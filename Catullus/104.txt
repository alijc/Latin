CIV.

Credis me potuisse meae maledicere vitae,
     ambobus mihi quae carior est oculis?
non potui, nec, si possem, tam perdite amarem:
     sed tu cum Tappone omnia monstra facis.


You think that I could speak ill of my life,
   who is dearer to me than both my eyes?
I could not, and, if I could, wouldn't love so desperately:
   but you and Tappo invent all sorts of wonders.
