CXIII. ad Gaium Helvium Cinnam

Consule Pompeio primum duo, Cinna, solebant
     Maeciliam: facto consule nunc iterum
manserunt duo, sed creverunt milia in unum
     singula. fecundum semen adulterio.


to Gaius Helvius Cinna

Cinna, in the first consulate of Pompey, two were wont
to do Maecilia: then, after he became consul again,
they remained two, but seemed a thousand each.
Semen grows fertile through adultery.
