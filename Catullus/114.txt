CXIV. ad Mentulam

Firmanus saltu non falso Mentula diues
     fertur, qui tot res in se habet egregias,
aucupium omne genus, piscis, prata, arva ferasque.
     nequiquam: fructus sumptibus exsuperat.
quare concedo sit diues, dum omnia desint.
     saltum laudemus, dum modo ipse egeat.

to Mentula

Mentula of Fermo is not falsely called rich due to his estate,
   which holds within it so many excellent things,
with every kind of game-bird, fish, meadows, plowed fields and beasts.
   But in vain: its profits don't cover its expenses.
Therefore I allow that he is rich, while everything is wanting.
   Let us praise the estate, while he himself lacks means.
