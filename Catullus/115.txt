CXV. ad Mentulam

Mentula habet instar triginta iugera prati,
     quadraginta arui: cetera sunt maria.
cur non divitiis Croesum superare potis sit,
     uno qui in saltu tot bona possideat,
prata arva ingentes silvas saltusque paludesque
     usque ad Hyperboreos et mare ad Oceanum?
omnia magna haec sunt, tamen ipsest maximus ultro,
     non homo, sed vero mentula magna minax.


to Mentula

Mentula has the equivalent of a 20-acre field,
   25 under the plow, and the rest under water.
Why can't he to surpass Croesus in wealth,
   who possesses in a single estate so many good things,
fields, meadows, huge forests and woodlands and marshes
   all the way to the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean?
These are all great things, but he himself is by far the greatest,
   not a man, but truly a pronounced projecting prick.
