CXVI. ad Gellium

Saepe tibi studioso animo venante requirens
carmina uti possem mittere Battiadae,
qui te lenirem nobis, neu conarere
tela infesta mittere in usque caput,
hunc video mihi nunc frustra sumptum esse laborem,
Gelli, nec nostras hic valuisse preces.
contra nos tela ista tua evitabimus amitha
at fixus nostris tu dabis supplicium.

to Gellius

Often, seeking poems of Battiades to send
to you, who hunt them with a zealous mind, 
with which I might soften you towards us, to not try
to cast annoying barbs all the way to our head.
But now I see, Gellius, that I've taken up this work in vain,
and that our prayers have not borne fruit in this way.
Instead we will avoid those barbs that you have thrown,
but you will pay the price, pierced by our own.
