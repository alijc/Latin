1. THE ARK

Haec nārrantur ā poētīs dē Perseō. Perseus fīlius erat Iōvis, maximī
deōrum; avus eius Acrisius appellābātur. Acrisius volēbat Perseum
nepōtem suum necāre; nam propter ōrāculum puerum timēbat.
Comprehendit igitur Perseum adhuc īnfantem, et cum matre in arcā
ligneā inclūsit. Tum arcam ipsam in mare coniēcit. Danaë, Perseī
mater, magnopere territa est; tempestās enim magna mare turbābat.
Perseus autem in sinū mātris dormiēbat.


These things are told by the poets about Perseus.  Perseus was the son
of Jupiter, the greatest of the gods; His grandfather was called
Acrisius.  Acrisius wished to slay his grandson Perseus; for because
of an oracle he feared the boy.  Therefore he siezed Perseus, still a
baby, and enclosed him with his mother in a wooden ark.  Then he threw
the ark itself into the sea.  Danaë, Perseus' mother, was immensely
terrified; for a great storm disturbed the sea.  But Perseus slept in
his mother's lap.
