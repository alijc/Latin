9. THE REWARD OF VALOR

Perseus postquam ad lītus dēscendit, prīmum tālāria exuit; tum ad 
rūpem vēnit ubi Andromeda vincta erat. Ea autem omnem spem
salūtis dēposuerat, et ubi Perseus adiit, terrōre paene exanimāta
erat. Ille vincula statim solvit, et puellam patrī reddidit. Cēpheus ob
hanc rem maximō gaudiō affectus est. Meritam grātiam prō tantō 
beneficiō Perseō rettulit; praetereā Andromedam ipsam eī in
matrimōnium dedit. Ille libenter hoc donum accēpit et puellam
dūxit. Paucōs annōs cum uxōre suā in eā regiōne habitābat, et in
magnō honōre erat apud omnēs Aethiopēs. Magnopere tamen
mātrem suam rursus vidēre cupiēbat. Tandem igitur cum uxōre suā 
ē regnō Cēpheī discessit.


After Perseus alighted onto the shore, he first pulled off the winged
sandals, and then went to the rock where Andromeda had been fettered.
But she had given up every hope of salvation, and when Perseus approached,
had been all but killed with terror.  He loosened the chain at once,
and restored the maiden to her father.  On account of this Cepheus was
moved with the greatest joy.  He tendered due thanks for such a service to
Perseus; and in addition gave Andromeda herself to him in marriage.  He
freely accepted this offer and wed the maiden.  For a few years he lived in
the region with his wife, and was in great honor among all the Ethiopians.
But he greatly desired to see his mother again.  So in the end he and his
wife left the kingdom of Cepheus.
