11. THE ORACLE FULFILLED

Post haec Perseus cum uxōre suā ad urbem Acrisī rediit. Ille autem 1
ubi Perseum vīdit, magno terrōre affectus est; nam propter
ōrāculum istud nepōtem suum adhuc timēbat. In Thessaliam igitur
ad urbem Larīsam statim refūgit, frustrā tamen; neque enim fātum
suum vītāvit. Post paucōs annōs rēx Larīsae ludōs magnōs fēcit; 5
nuntiōs in omnēs partēs dīmīserat et diem ēdixerat. Multī ex
omnibus urbibus Graeciae ad lūdōs convēnērunt. Ipse Perseus inter
aliōs certāmen discōrum iniit. At dum discum conicit, avum suum
cāsū occīdit; Acrisius enim inter spectātōrēs eius certāminis forte
stābat.


After this Perseus returned to Acrisius' city with his wife.
But when he saw Perseus, he was filled with pure terror, because he
still feared his grandson on account of that oracle.  Therefore he
straight-way fled into Thessaly, to the city of Larisa.  But it was
in vain, for he didn't avoid his fate.  After a few years the king of
Larisa organized great games; he had sent out messengers to all
directions and had proclaimed the day.  Many assembled for the
games from every city of Greece.  Perseus himself, among others, entered
the discus contest,  But when he threw the discus, he accidentally 
killed his grandfather; for by chance Acrisius was standing among the 
spectators of that contest.
