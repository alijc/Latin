13. HERCULES AND THE SERPENTS

Īphiclēs, frāter Herculis, magnā vōce exclāmāvit; sed Herculēs ipse, 1
fortissimus puer, haudquāquam territus est. Parvīs manibus
serpentēs statim prehendit, et colla eārum magnā vī compressit.
Tālī modō serpentēs ā puerō interfectae sunt. Alcmēna autem, māter
puerōrum, clamōrem audīverat, et marītum suum ē somnō 5
excitāverat. Ille lūmen accendit et gladium suum rapuit; tum ad
puerōs properābat, sed ubi ad locum vēnit, rem mīram vīdit,
Herculēs enim rīdēbat et serpentēs mortuās mōnstrābat.

Iphicles, Hercules' brother, cried out in a loud voice; but Hercules
himself, that bravest of boys, wasn't scared at all.  He straightway
grabbed the serpents in his little hands, and squeezed their necks 
with all his strength. In this way the serpents were killed by the
boy.  Now Alcmena, the boys' mother, had heard the din, and woke
her husband.  He kindled a light and seized his sword; then ran
to the boys, but when he got to the spot, he saw an amazing thing,
for Hercules was laughing and displaying the dead serpents.
