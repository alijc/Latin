14. THE MUSIC-LESSON

Herculēs ā puerō corpus suum diligenter exercēbat; magnam
partem diēī in palaestrā consumēbat; didicit etiam arcum intendere
et tēla conicere. Hīs exercitātiōnibus vīrēs eius confirmātae sunt. In
musicā etiam ā Linō centaurō ērudiēbatur (centaurī autem equī
erant sed caput hominis habēbant); huic tamen artī minus dīligenter
studēbat. Hic Linus Herculem ōlim obiurgābat, quod nōn studiōsus
erat; tum puer īrātus citharam subitō rapuit, et omnibus vīribus
caput magistrī īnfēlīcis percussit. Ille ictū prostrātus est, et paulō
post ē vītā excessit, neque quisquam posteā id officium suscipere
voluit.


Hercules carefully trained his body from boyhood; he spent a large part
of the day in the wrestling court; and also learned how to aim a bow and 
throw a spear.  His strength was developed by these execises.  Likewise,
he was instructed in music by the centaur Linus (now centaurs were horses,
but they had the head of a man); yet he studied this art less carefully.
This Linus once scolded Hercules, because he wasn't studious.
Then the angry boy grabbed his lyre, and struck the head of his 
unfortunate teacher with all his might.  He was laid out by that blow,
and a little later lost his life, and after that no man wanted to 
take on the job.
