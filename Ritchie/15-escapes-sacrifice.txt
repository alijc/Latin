5. HERCULES ESCAPES SACRIFICE

Dē Hercule haec etiam inter alia nārrantur. Ōlim dum iter facit, in
fīnēs Aegyptiōrum vēnit. Ibi rēx quīdam, nōmine Būsīris, illō
tempore rēgnābat; hic autem vir crūdēlissimus hominēs immolāre
cōnsuēverat. Herculem igitur corripuit et in vincula coniēcit. Tum
nūntiōs dīmisit et diem sacrificiō ēdīxit. Mox ea diēs appetēbat, et
omnia rītē parāta sunt. Manūs Herculis catēnīs ferreīs vinctae sunt,
et mola salsa in caput eius inspersa est. Mōs enim erat apud
antīquōs salem et far capitibus victimārum impōnere. Iam victima
ad āram stābat; iam sacerdōs cultrum sūmpserat. Subitō tamen
Herculēs magnō cōnātū vincula perrūpit; tum ictū sacerdōtem 10
prostrāvit; alterō rēgem ipsum occīdit.


They still tell these tales (among others) about Hercules.
Once upon a time while on a journey, he came to the land of
the Egyptians.  There a certain king, named Busiris, reigned
at that time; but this cruelest of men was wont to make
sacrifices of human beings.  Hence he laid hold of Hercules
and threw him into chains.  Then he sent out messengers and 
proclaimed the day for the sacrifice.  That day soon neared,
and everything was duly prepared.  Hercules' hands were bound
with shackles of iron, and salted meal was sprinkled on his head.
For it was the custom among the ancients to put salt and wheat
on the heads of their sacrificial victims.  The victim was
already standing at the altar; the priest had alread taken up
the knife.  Yet suddenly Hercules broke the chains with a great 
effort; then he sacked the priest with a blow; and with another
killed the king himself.
