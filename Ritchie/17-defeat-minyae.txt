17. THE DEFEAT OF THE MINYAE

Ergīnus, rēx Minyārum, ob haec vehementer īrātus statim cum 
omnibus copiīs in fīnēs Thēbānōrum contendit. Creōn adventum
eius per explorātōrēs cognōvit. Ipse tamen pugnāre nōluit, nam
magnō timōre affectus erat; Thēbānī igitur Herculem imperātorem
creāvērunt. Ille nuntiōs in omnēs partēs dīmisit, et cōpiās coēgit; 
tum proximō diē cum magnō exercitū profectus est. Locum
idōneum dēlēgit et aciem īnstrūxit. Tum Thēbānī ē superiōre locō
impetum in hostēs fēcērunt. Illī autem impetum sustinēre nōn
potuērunt; itaque aciēs hostium pulsa est atque in fūgam conversa.

Erginus, the king of the Minyae, fell into a violent rage on account
of this and at once rushed into the territory of the Thebans with
all his troops.  Creon learned of his advance through his scouts.
He himself was still unwilling to fight, for he had been affected 
with great fear; therefore the Thebans made Hercules their general.
He sent messengers in every direction, and collected his troops;
then set out on the next day with a great army.  He chose a suitable
spot and drew up his line of battle.  Then the Thebans launched an
attack into the enemy from their higher location.  They, however,
couldn't sustain the attack and so the battle line of the enemy
was routed and turned to flight.
