18. MADNESS AND MURDER

Post hoc proelium Herculēs cōpiās suās ad urbem redūxit. Omnēs
Thēbānī propter victōriam maximē gaudēbant; Creōn autem magnīs
honoribus Herculem decorāvit, atque fīliam suam eī in
matrimōnium dedit. Herculēs cum uxōre suā beātam vītam agēbat;
sed post paucōs annōs subitō in furōrem incidit, atque liberōs suōs 5
ipse suā manū occīdit. Post breve tempus ad sanitātem reductus est,
et propter hoc facinus magnō dolōre affectus est; mox ex urbe
effūgit et in silvās sē recēpit. Nolēbant enim cīvēs sermōnem cum
eō habēre.

After this battle Hercules led his troops back to the city.
Every Theban was in euphoria on account of the victory;
and Creon glorified Hercules with great honors, and gave
him his daughter in marriage.  Hercules led a happy life
with his wife; but after a few years he suddenly fell into a rage,
and slew his own childern by his own hand.  After a brief time
he was restored to sanity, and was afflicted with great sorrow 
on account of this crime.  He soon fled the city and retreated 
into the forest.  For his countrymen didn't want to have
speech with him.
