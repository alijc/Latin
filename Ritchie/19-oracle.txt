19. HERCULES CONSULTS THE ORACLE

Herculēs tantum scelus expiāre magnopere cupiēbat. Constituit
igitur ad ōrāculum Delphicum īre; hoc enim ōrāculum erat omnium
celeberrimum. Ibi templum erat Apollinis plūrimīs dōnis ornātum.
Hōc in templō sedēbat fēmina quaedam, nōmine Pythia, et
cōnsilium dabat eīs quī ad ōrāculum veniēbant. Haec autem femina
ab ipsō Apolline docēbatur, et voluntātem deī hominibus
ēnuntiābat. Herculēs igitur, quī Apollinem praecipuē colēbat, hūc
vēnit. Tum rem tōtam expōsuit, neque scelus cēlāvit.

Hercules very much desired to atone for so great a crime.
Therefore he resolved to go to the Delphic oracle; 
for this oracle was the most renowned of all.
The temple there had been adorned with a great many offering for Apollo.
In this temple sat a certain woman, named Pythia,
and she gave advice to those who came to the oracle.
Now this women was taught by Apollo himself, 
and revealed the will of the gods to men.
Therefore Hercules, who especially cherished Apollo, came here.
Then he explained the whole matter, and didn't conceal his crime.
