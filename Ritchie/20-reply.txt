20. THE ORACLE'S REPLY

Ubi Hercules fīnem fēcit, Pythia prīmō tacēbat; tandem tamen iussit
eum ad urbem Tīryntha īre, et Eurystheī rēgis omnia
imperāta facere. Herculēs ubi haec audīvit, ad urbem illam
contendit, et Eurystheō rēgī sē in servitūtem trādidit. Duodecim
annōs crudelissimō Eurystheō serviēbat, et duodecim labōrēs, quōs
ille imperāverat, cōnfēcit; hōc enim ūnō modō tantum scelus expiārī
potuit. Dē hīs labōribus plūrima ā poētīs scripta sunt. Multa tamen
quae poētae nārrant vix crēdibilia sunt.

When Hercules finished, at first Pythia was silent; 
yet in the end she ordered him to go to the city of Tiryns,
and to follow all the commands of King Eurystheus.
When Hercules heard this, he hastened to that city,
and gave himself to servitute to King Eurystheus.
He served the most cruel Eurystheus for twelve years,
and completed the twelve labors that he commanded him to do;
for only in this way could he atone for such a crime.
Poets have written a great deal about these labors.
Yet much that these poets say beggars belief.
