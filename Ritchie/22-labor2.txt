22. 2nd LABOR: THE LERNEAN HYDRA

Paulō post iussus est ab Eurystheō Hydram necāre. Hoc autem mōnstrum
erat cui novem erant capita. Hercules igitur cum amīcō Iolaō profectus est
ad palūdem Lernaeam, in quā Hydra habitābat. Mox mōnstrum invēnit, et
quamquam rēs erat magni periculī, collum eius sinistrā prehendit. Tum
dextrā capita novem abscīdere coepit; quotiēns tamen hoc fēcerat, nova
capita exoriēbantur. Diū frustrā laborābat; tandem hōc cōnātū dēstitit.
Deinde arborēs succīdere et ignem accendere cōnstituit. Hoc celeriter
fēcit, et postquam ligna ignem comprehendērunt, face ārdente colla
adūssit, unde capita exoriēbantur. Nec tamen sine magnō labōre haec
fēcit; vēnit enim auxiliō Hydrae cancer ingēns, quī, dum Herculēs capita
abscīdit, crūra eius mordēbat. Postquam mōnstrum talī modō interfēcit,
sagittās suās sanguine eius imbuit, itaque mortiferās reddidit.


A little later he was ordered by Eurystheus to kill the Hydra.
Now this monster was one that had nine heads.  
Therefore Hercules set out with his friend Iolaus ato 
the Lernean swamp, in which the Hydra lived.
He soon found the monster, and although the matter was
of great peril, he seized its neck with his left hand.
Then he started hacking off the nine heads with his right hand;
but as soon as he'd done so, new heads sprang up.
He labored long and in vain; and finally gave up on this effort.
Then he decided to cut down trees and kindle a fire.  
He quickly did this, and after the wood had ignited,
with a flaming torch he set fire to the necks from which
the heads were springing up.  But not without great effort
did he do this; for to aid the Hydra there came a huge crab,
that kept biting Hercules' legs while he cut off the heads.  
After he had killed the monster in so excellent a way,
he soaked his arrows in its blood, thus rendering them death-dealing.
