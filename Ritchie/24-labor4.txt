24. 4th LABOR: THE ERYMANTHIAN BOAR

Tum vērō iussus est Herculēs aprum quendam capere quī illō
tempore agrōs Erymanthiōs vāstābat et incolās huius regiōnis
magnopere terrēbat. Herculēs rem suscēpit et in Arcadiam
profectus est. Postquam in silvam paulum prōgressus est, aprō
occurrit. Ille autem simul atque Herculem vīdit, statim refūgit; et
timōre perterritus in altam fossam sē proiēcit. Herculēs igitur
laqueum quem attulerat iniēcit, et summā cum difficultāte aprum ē
fossā extrāxit. Ille etsī fortiter repugnābat, nūllō modō sē liberāre
potuit; et ab Hercule ad Eurystheum vīvus relātus est.

Indeed Hercules was next commanded to capture a certain boar
which was at that time laying waste to Erymanthus' fields
and greatly terrifying the inhabitants of these regions.
Hercules undertook the affair and set out for Arcadia.
After he'd advanced a little way into the forest, he ran into
the boar.  But it saw Hercules at the same time, and fled at once;
and in terror threw itself into a deep ditch.  And so Hercules
threw a noose that he'd brought, and pulled the boar out of the
ditch with the utmost difficulty.  Although it struggled valiantly,
it couldn't get free no how; and was brought back to Eurystheus,
alive, by Hercules.
