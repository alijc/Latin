25. HERCULES AT THE CENTAUR'S CAVE

Dē quartō labōre, quem suprā narrāvimus, haec etiam trāduntur.
Herculēs dum iter in Arcadiam facit, ad eam regiōnem vēnit quam
centaurī incolēbant. Cum nox iam appeteret, ad spēluncam dēvertit
in quā centaurus quīdam, nōmine Pholus, habitābat.
Ille Herculem benignē excēpit et cēnam parāvit. At Herculēs
postquam cenāvit, vīnum ā Pholō postulāvit. Erat autem in
speluncā magna amphora vīnō optimō replēta, quam centaurī ibi
dēposuerant. Pholus igitur hoc vīnum dare nolēbat, quod reliquōs
centaurōs timēbat; nūllum tamen vīnum praeter hoc in speluncā
habēbat. "Hoc vīnum," inquit, "mihi commissum est. Sī igitur hoc 10
dabō, centaurī mē interficient." Herculēs tamen eum irrīsit, et ipse
pōculum vīnī dē amphorā hausit.

About the fourth labor, which we related above, these things 
are reported as well.  Hercules, on his journey to Arcadia,
came to that region where the centaurs lived.  Because night
was already drawing near, he turned aside to a cave in which
a certain centaur, Pholus by name, lived.

He warmly welcomed Hercules and prepared supper.  But after Hercules ate, 
he asked Pholus for wine.  Now there was a large jar of wine in the cave,
filled with the best wine, which the centaurs had deposited there.
Therefore Pholus wasn't willing to give this wine away, because he
was afraid of the other centaurs; yet he had no wine other than
this in the cave.  "This wine", he said, "has been entrusted to me.
And so if I give it away, the centaurs will kill me."
But Hercules mocked him, and himself drew a cup of wine from the jar.
