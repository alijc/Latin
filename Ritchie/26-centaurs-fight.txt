26. THE FIGHT WITH THE CENTAURS

Simul atque amphora aperta est, odor iūcundissimus undique
diffūsus est; vīnum enim suāvissimum erat. Centaurī nōtum
odorem sēnsērunt et omnēs ad locum convēnērunt. Ubi ad
spēluncam pervēnērunt, magnopere īrātī erant quod Herculem
bibentem vīdērunt. Tum arma rapuērunt et Pholum interficere
volēbant. Herculēs tamen in aditū spēluncae cōnstitit et impetum
eōrum fortissimē sustinēbat. Facēs ārdentēs in eōs coniēcit; multōs
etiam sagittīs suīs vulnerāvit. Hae autem sagittae eaedem erant
quae sanguine Hydrae ōlim imbūtae erant. Omnēs igitur quōs ille
sagittīs vulnerāverat venēnō statim absūmptī sunt; reliquī autem
ubi hoc vīdērunt, terga vertērunt et fugā salūtem petiērunt.


As soon as the jar was opened, the most delightful aroma was wafted
on all sides; for the wine was very sweet.  The centaurs perceived
the familiar aroma and all gathered at the spot.  When they reached
the cave, they were greatly angered because they saw Hercules 
drinking.  Then they seized their weapons and wished to kill Pholus.
But Hercules stood in the mouth of the cave and sustained their
attack most bravely.  He threw burning torches at them;
and also wounded many of them with his arrows. Now these were
the same arrows that had previously been dipped in the Hydra's blood.
And so every centaur that he wounded with the arrows was straightway consumed
by poison; and when the rest saw this, they turned their backs
and sought safety in flight.
