27. THE FATE OF PHOLUS

Postquam reliquī fūgērunt, Pholus ex spēluncā ēgressus est, et
corpora spectābat eōrum quī sagittīs interfectī erant. Magnopere
autem mirātus est quod tam levī vulnere exanimāti erant, et causam
eius reī quaerēbat. Adiit igitur locum ubi cādaver cuiusdam
centaurī iacēbat, et sagittam ē vulnere trāxit. Haec tamen sīve cāsū
sīve cōnsiliō deōrum ē manibus eius lapsa est, et pedem leviter
vulnerāvit. Ille extemplō dolōrem gravem per omnia membra
sēnsit, et post breve tempus vī venēnī exanimātus est. Mox
Herculēs, quī reliquōs centaurōs secūtus erat, ad spēluncam rediit,
et magnō cum dolōre Pholum mortuum vīdit. Multīs cum lacrimīs
corpus amicī ad sepultūram dedit; tum, postquam alterum pōculum
vīnī exhausit, somnō sē dedit.

After the others fled, Pholus came out of the cave, and was looking at
the bodies of those who had been killed by the arrows.  Now this was
a thing of great wonder, because they had been killed by such slight
wounds, and he was seeking the reason for this.  And so he came to the
place where the corpse of a certain centaur was lying, and pulled the 
arrow out of the wound.  But the arrow, either by accident or by
the plan of the gods, slipped out of his hands, and wounded his foot
slightly.  He immediately felt an oppressive pain through all of his
limbs, and after a short time was killed by the powerstrength of the poison.
Soon Hercules, who had pursued the other centaurs, returned to the cave,
and with great sorrow found Pholus dead.  With many tears he consigned
the body of his friend to the grave; then after drinking another
cup of wine, gave himself over to sleep.
