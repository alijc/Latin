30. 7th LABOR: THE CRETAN BULL

Tum Eurystheus Herculī imperāvit ut taurum quendam ferōcissimum ex 1
īnsulā Crētā vīvum referret. Ille igitur nāvem cōnscendit, et cum ventus
idōneus esset, statim solvit. Cum tamen īnsulae iam appropinquāret, tanta
tempestās subitō coörta est ut nāvis cursum tenēre non posset. Tantus
autem timor animōs nautārum occupāvit ut paene omnem spem salūtis 5
dēpōnerent. Herculēs tamen, etsī navigandī imperītus erat, haudquāquam
territus est.

Post breve tempus summa tranquillitās cōnsecūta est, et nautae, quī sē
ex timōre iam recēperant, nāvem incolumem ad terram appulērunt.
Herculēs ē nāvī ēgressus est, et cum ad regem Crētae vēnisset, causam 10
veniendī docuit. Deinde, postquam omnia parāta sunt, ad eam regiōnem
contendit quam taurus vāstābat. Mox taurum vīdit, et quamquam rēs erat
magnī periculī, cornua eius prehendit. Tum, cum ingentī labōre mōnstrum
ad nāvem trāxisset, cum praedā in Graeciam rediit.


Then Eurystheus commanded Hercules to fetch, alive, a certain
ferocious bull from the island of Crete.  And so he boarded a
ship, and after finding a favorable wind, set sail at once.  But
after they had gotten close to the island, such a storm suddenly
rose up that the ship couldn't hold its course.  And such a great
fear siezed the hearts of the sailors that they all but gave up
all hope.  But Hercules, even though he had no experience as a
sailor, was not frightened at all.

After a short spell a supreme calm followed, and the sailors, who
had already recovered from their fear, landed the ship with no
damage.  Hercules disembarked from the ship, and when he had come
to the king of Crete, told him why he had come.  Then, after
everything had been prepared, he hastened to the region that the
bull had laid waste to.  He soon saw the bull, and although it
was very dangerous, seized it by the horns.  Then, after he had,
with a huge struggle, dragged the monster to the ship, he
returned to Greece with his prize.
