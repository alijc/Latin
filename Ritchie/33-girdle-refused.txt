33. THE GIRDLE IS REFUSED

Hīs virīs Herculēs persuāsit, postquam causam itineris exposuit, ut
sēcum iter facerent. Tum cum eīs quibus persuāserat nāvem
cōnscendit, et cum ventus idōneus esset, post paucōs diēs ad
ōstium flūminis Thermōdontis appulit. Postquam in fīnēs
Amazonum vēnit, nūntium ad Hippolytam mīsit, quī causam
veniendī doceret et balteum posceret. Ipsa Hippolytē balteum
trādere volēbat, quod dē Herculis virtūte fāmam accēperat; reliquae
tamen Amāzonēs eī persuāsērunt ut negāret. At Herculēs, cum haec
nuntiāta essent, bellī fortūnam temptāre cōnstituit.
Proximō igitur diē cum cōpiās ēdūxisset, locum idōneum dēlegit
et hostēs ad pugnam ēvocāvit. Amāzonēs quoque cōpiās suās ex
castrīs ēdūxērunt et non magnō intervāllō ab Hercule aciem
īnstrūxērunt.

After Hercules explained the reason for the journey to these men,
he convinced them to travel with him.  Then, along with the men
that he had persuaded, he boarded the ship, and, since the wind was
favorable, after a few days he put ashore at the mouth of the
River Thermodon.  After that he came to the country of the
Amazons, and sent a messenger to Hippolyte, to explain the reason
for his arrival and to demand the girdle.  Hippolyte herself
was willing to hand over the girdle, because she had heard report of
Hercules' strength; but the rest of the Amazons persuaded her to
refuse.  When these things had been related to Hercules, he
resolved to try the fortune of war.  Therefore, on the next day he
marched out with his troops.  He chose a suitable place and called
the enemy out to battle.  The Amazons likewise marched their
troops out of their fortress and drew up a battle array not far
from Hercules.
