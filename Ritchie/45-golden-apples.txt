45. 11th LABOR: GOLDEN APPLES OF THE HESPERIDES

Eurystheus postquam bovēs Gēryonis accēpit, labōrem ūndecimum
Herculī impōsuit, graviōrem quam quōs suprā narrāvimus. Mandāvit
enim eī ut aurea pōma ex hortō Hesperidum auferret. Hesperidēs autem
nymphae erant quaedam formā praestantissimā, quae in terrā longinquā
habitābant, et quibus aurea quaedam pōma ā Iunōne commissa erant.
Multī hominēs, aurī cupiditāte inductī, haec pōma auferre iam anteā
cōnātī erant. Rēs tamen difficillima erat, namque hortus in quō pōma
erant murō ingentī undique circumdātus erat; praetereā dracō quīdam cui
centum erant capita portam hortī diligenter custodiēbat. Opus igitur quod
Eurystheus Herculī imperāverat erat summae difficultātis, nōn modō ob
causās quās memorāvimus, sed etiam quod Herculēs omnīnō ignorābat
quō in locō hortus ille situs esset.

After Eurystheus got the oxen of Geryon, he set an eleventh labor 
for Hercules, harder than the ones we've already described. 
For he commanded him to carry off the golden apples from the garden of
the Hesperides. Now the Hesperides were nymphs of a certain inestimable
beauty, who lived in a far-off land, and to whom certain golden apples 
had been entrusted by Juno.  Many men, lured by the desire for gold, 
had already tried to carry these apples off before.
But it was a difficult thing to do, for the garden in which the
apples were had been completely enclosed by an enormous wall;
in addition, a certain dragon, with a hundred heads, diligently
guarded the gates of the garden.  And so the work that Eurystheus had
ordered Hercules to do was of the utmost difficulty, not only on
account of the reasons that we've recounted, but also because Hercules
didn't know where in the world this garden was.
