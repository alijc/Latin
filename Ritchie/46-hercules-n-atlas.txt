46. HERCULES ASKS AID OF ATLAS

Herculēs, quamquam quiētem vehementer cupiēbat, tamen
Eurystheō parēre cōnstituit, et simul ac iussa eius accēpit,
proficiscī matūrāvit. Ā multīs mercātoribus quaesīverat quō in locō
Hesperidēs habitārent, nihil tamen certum reperīre potuerat. Frustrā
per multās terrās iter fēcit et multa perīcula subiit; tandem, cum in
hīs itineribus tōtum annum cōnsumpsisset, ad extrēmam partem
orbis terrārum, quae proxima est Ōceanō, pervēnit. Hic stābat vir
quīdam, nōmine Atlas, ingentī magnitūdine corporis, quī caelum
(ita trāditum est) umerīs suīs sustinēbat, nē in terram dēcideret.
Herculēs tantās vīrēs magnopere mirātus statim in colloquium cum
Atlante vēnit, et cum causam itineris docuisset, auxilium ab eō
petiit.

Although Hercules longed for rest, nonetheless he decided to obey
Eurystheus, and hastened to set out as soon as he'd received his
orders. He had inquired of many traders for the place that the
Hesperides lived, but hadn't been able to find out anything for
sure. He journeyed through many lands and underwent many dangers in
vain; in the end, after spending an entire year in these journeys, he
reached the farthest part of the world, near Oceanus.  Here stood a
certain man, Altas by name, who had an enormous body and who held up
the sky (or so it has been reported) with his shoulders, so that it
wouldn't fall to earth.  Hercules, marvelling at such an immensity of
strength, at once fell to talking with Atlas, and after telling him
the reason for his journey, asked him for his help.
