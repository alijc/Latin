49. 12th LABOR: CERBERUS THE THREE-HEADED DOG

Postquam aurea pōma ad Eurystheum relāta sunt, ūnus modō
relinquēbātur ē duodecim labōribus quōs Pythia Herculī
praecēperat. Eurystheus autem cum Herculem magnopere timēret,
eum in aliquem locum mittere volēbat unde numquam redīre
posset. Negōtium igitur eī dedit ut canem Cerberum ex Orcō in
lūcem trāheret. Hoc opus omnium difficillimum erat, nēmō enim
umquam ex Orcō redierat. Praetereā Cerberus iste mōnstrum erat
horribilī speciē, cui tria erant capita serpentibus saevīs cīncta.
Antequam tamen dē hōc labore narrāmus, non aliēnum vidētur,
quoniam dē Orcō mentiōnem fēcimus, pauca dē eā regiōne
prōpōnere.

After the golden apples had been tendered to Eurystheus,
there remained only one of the twelve tasks that Pythia had
ordered for Hercules.  But Eurystheus, since he greatly feared
Hercules, wanted to send him to some place that he'd never be
able to return from.  Therefore he gave him the job to fetch the
dog Cerberus from the Underworld into the light of day.  This
labor was the hardest of them all, for no one had ever returned
from the Underworld.  Besides, that Cerberus was a horrible kind
of monster, who had three heads that were surrounded by savage
snakes.  Still, before we tell of this labor, it would not be
amiss, because we have mentioned the Underworld, to relate a bit
about that region.
