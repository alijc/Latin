52. HERCULES CROSSES THE STYX

Herculēs postquam imperia Eurystheī accēpit, in Lacōniam ad
Taenarum statim sē contulit; ibi enim spēlunca erat ingentī
magnitūdine, per quam, ut trādēbātur, hominēs ad Orcum
dēscendēbant. Eō cum vēnisset, ex incolīs quaesīvit quō in locō
spēlunca illa sita esset; quod cum cognōvisset, sine morā
dēscendere cōnstituit. Nec tamen sōlus hoc iter faciēbat, Mercūrius
enim et Minerva sē eī sociōs adiunxerant. Ubi ad rīpam Stygis
vēnit, Herculēs scapham Charontis cōnscendit, ut ad ulteriōrem
rīpam trānsīret. Cum tamen Herculēs vir esset ingentī magnitūdine
corporis, Charōn solvere nōlēbat; magnopere enim verēbātur nē
scapha sua tantō pondere onerāta in mediō flūmine mergerētur.
Tandem tamen, minīs Herculis territus, Charōn scapham solvit, et
eum incolumem ad ulteriōrem rīpam perdūxit.

Hercules, after he had accepted the commands of Eurystheus, betook
himself at once to Taenarus in Laconia; for that was where the huge
cave was, through which, as it is related, men used to descend into
the Underworld.  When he had gotten there, he inquired of the
inhabitants where that cave might be located; and after he had
found it out, he arranged to descend without delay.  But 
he wasn't making this journey alone, for Mercury and Minerva had
attached themselves to him as allies.  When he came to the bank of
the Styx, Hercules climbed into Charon's boat, in order to cross to
the far bank.  But since Hercules was an enormous man, Charon
didn't want to cast off; for he dreaded that his boat, laden with 
so much weight, would capsize in the middle of the river.  But finally,
frightened by Hercules' threats, Charon launched his boat, and
conducted him safely to the far shore.
