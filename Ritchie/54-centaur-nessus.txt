54. THE CENTAUR NESSUS

Posteā Herculēs multa alia praeclara perfēcit, quae nunc perscribere
longum est. Tandem iam aetāte prōvectus Dēianīram, Oeneī fīliam, in
matrimōnium dūxit; post tamen trēs annōs accidit ut puerum quendam,
cui nōmen erat Eunomus, cāsū occīderit. Cum autem mōs esset, ut sī quis
hominem cāsū occīdisset, in exsilium īret, Herculēs cum uxōre sua ē
fīnibus eius civitātis exīre matūrāvit. Dum tamen iter faciunt, ad flūmen
quoddam pervēnērunt in quō nūllus pōns erat; et dum quaerunt quōnam
modō flūmen trānseant, accurrit centaurus Nessus, quī viātōribus
auxilium obtulit. Herculēs igitur uxōrem suam in tergum Nessī impōsuit;
tum ipse flūmen trānāvit. Nessus autem paulum in aquam prōgressus ad
rīpam subitō revertēbātur et Deīanīram auferre conābātur. Quod cum
animadvertisset Herculēs, ira graviter commōtus arcum intendit et pectus
Nessī sagittā trānsfīxit.

Afterwards Hercules accomplished many other famous deeds, which would
be tedious to write out in full now.  Finally, after he had grown old
he married Deianira, the daughter of Oeneus.  Yet after three years it
happened that he accidentally killed a certain boy, whose name was
Eunomus.  Now since it was the custom that if anyone had killed a man
by accident he should go into exile, Hercules and his wife hastened to
leave the territory of their state.  But while they were making the
journey, they arrived at a certain river that didn't have a bridge over
it; and while they searched for some way to cross the river, the
centaur Nessus rushed up and offered his aid to the travelers.  And so
Hercules set his wife on Nessus' back; and then he swam across
the river by himself. But Nessus, after going a little way into the water,
suddenly returned to the shore and tried to carry Deianira off.
When Hercules observed this he was deeply provoked with rage.  He bent
his bow and pierced Nessus' breast with an arrow.
