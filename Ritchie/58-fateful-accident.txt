58. A FATEFUL ACCIDENT

Post breve tempus Peliās, veritus nē regnum suum tantā vī et
fraude occupātum āmitteret, amīcum quendam Delphōs mīsit, quī
ōrāculum cōnsuleret. Ille igitur quam celerrimē Delphōs sē contulit
et quam ob causam vēnisset demōnstrāvit. Respondit ōrāculum
nūllum esse in praesentiā perīculum; monuit tamen Peliam ut sī
quis ūnum calceum gerens venīret, eum cavēret. Post paucīs annīs
accidit ut Peliās magnum sacrificium factūrus esset; nuntiōs in
omnēs partēs dīmīserat et certam diem conveniendī dīxerat. Diē
constitūtā magnus hominum numerus undique ex agrīs convēnit; in
hīs autem vēnit etiam Iāson, quī ā pueritiā apud centaurum
quendam habitāverat. Dum tamen iter facit, ūnum ē calceīs in
trānseundō nesciō quō flūmine āmīsit.

A little while later, Pelias, fearful that he might lose the
kingdom that he had seized through such force and deceit, sent one
of his friends to Delphi to consult the oracle.  And so this friend
betook himself to Delphi as quickly as possible and explained the
reason that he had come.  The oracle replied that there was no
danger at present; however it warned Pelias that he should be wary
of anyone who arrived wearing only one shoe.  After a few years it
came about that Pelias was going to make a great sacrifice, and had
sent messengers out to all directions and had named a fixed day for
people to assemble.  On the appointed day a great many people
assembled from all parts of the country.  Among was also Jason, who
had lived from boyhood with a certain centaur.  But when he was
making the journey, he lost one of his shoes while crossing some
river.
