59. THE GOLDEN FLEECE

Iāsōn igitur cum calceum āmissum nūllō modō recipere posset, ūnō
pede nūdō in rēgiam pervēnit. Quem cum Peliās vīdisset, subitō
timōre affectus est; intellēxit enim hunc esse hominem quem
ōrāculum demonstrāvisset. Hoc igitur cōnsilium iniit. Rēx erat
quīdam Aeētēs, quī regnum Colchidis illō tempore obtinēbat. Huic
commissum erat illud vellus aureum quod Phrixus ōlim ibi
relīquerat. Cōnstituit igitur Peliās Iāsonī negōtium dare ut hōc
vellere potīrētur; cum enim rēs esset magnī perīculī, eum in itinere
perītūrum esse spērābat. Iāsonem igitur ad sē arcessīvit, et eum
cohortātus quid fierī vellet docuit. Ille etsī intellegēbat rem esse
difficillimam, negōtium libenter suscēpit.

And so Jason, since he couldn't in any way retrieve the shoe that
he'd lost, reached the palace with one bare foot.  When Pelias saw
him, he was struck with fear; for he realized that this was the man
that the oracle had referred to.  And so he formed a plan. There was
a certain King Aeetes, who at that time held the kingdom of Colchis.
The golden fleece that Phrixus had once left there had been
entrusted to him.  And so Pelias decided to give Jason the task of
obtaining this fleece; for since the business was very dangerous, he
hoped that Jason would be killed on the journey.  And so he summoned
Jason to him, and after encouraging him, explained to him what he
wished to be done.  And Jason, even though he realized that it would
be difficult, freely accepted the task.
