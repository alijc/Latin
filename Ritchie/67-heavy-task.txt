67. A HEAVY TASK

Brevī intermissō spatiō Argonautae ad flūmen Phasim vēnērunt, quod in
fīnibus Colchōrum erat. Ibi cum nāvem appulissent et in terram ēgressī
essent, statim ad rēgem Aeëtem sē contulērunt et ab eō postulāvērunt ut
vellus aureum sibi trāderetur. Ille cum audīvisset quam ob causam
Argonautae vēnissent, īrā commōtus est et diū negābat sē vellus
trāditūrum esse. Tandem tamen, quod sciēbat Iāsonem nōn sine auxiliō
deōrum hoc negōtium suscēpisse, mutātā sententiā promīsit sē vellus
traditūrum, sī Iāsōn labōrēs duōs difficillimōs prius perfēcisset; et cum
Iāsōn dīxisset sē ad omnia perīcula subeunda parātum esse, quid fierī
vellet ostendit. Prīmum iungendī erant duo taurī speciē horribilī, quī
flammās ex ōre ēdebant; tum hīs iunctīs ager quīdam arandus erat et
dentēs dracōnis serendī. Hīs auditīs Iāsōn etsī rem esse summī perīculī
intellegēbat, tamen, nē hanc occāsiōnem reī bene gerendae āmitteret,
negōtium suscēpit.

After a brief time the Argonauts came to the river Phasis, which was in
the territory of Colchis.  There, after they had landed and disembarked,
they betook themselves to King Aeetes at once and demanded that he hand
over the golden fleece.  When he had heard why the Argonauts had come, he
was roused to rage and for a long time refused to surrender the fleece.
But in the end, since he knew that Jason had not taken up the business
without the aid of the gods, he changed his mind and promised to hand
the fleece over, if Jason would first accomplish two very difficult
labors.  And after Jason said that he was ready to undergo any peril, he
showed what he wanted done.  First, a pair of monstrous fire-breathing
bulls had to be yoked together; then, once they'd been yoked, a certain
field had to be plowed and sown with dragon's teeth.  When he heard this
Jason, even though he realized that the business was one of the utmost
peril, nonetheless undertook the task, so that he wouldn't lose the
chance of doing the thing well.
