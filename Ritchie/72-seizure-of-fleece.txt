72. THE SEIZURE OF THE FLEECE

Postrīdiē eius diēī Iāsōn cum sociīs suīs ortā lūce nāvem dēdūxit, et
tempestātem idōneam nactī ad eum locum rēmīs contendērunt, quō
in locō Medea vellus cēlātum esse dēmōnstrābat. Cum eō
vēnissent, Iāsōn in terram ēgressus est, et sociīs ad mare relictīs,
quī praesidiō nāvī essent, ipse cum Mēdēā in silvās sē contulit.
Pauca milia passuum per silvam progressus, vellus quod quaerēbat
ex arbore suspēnsum vīdit. Id tamen auferre erat summae
difficultātis; nōn modō enim locus ipse egregiē et nātūrā et arte erat
munītus, sed etiam dracō quīdam speciē terribilī arborem
custōdiēbat. Tum Mēdēa, quae, ut suprā dēmōnstrāvimus,
medicīnae summam scientiam habuit, rāmum quem de arbore
proximā dēripuerat venēno infēcit. Hōc factō ad locum
appropinquāvit, et dracōnem, quī, faucibus apertīs, eius adventum
exspectābat, venēnō sparsit; deinde, dum dracō somnō oppressus
dormit, Iāsōn vellus aureum de arbore dēripuit et cum Mēdēā quam
celerrimē pedem rettulit.

The next day, at sunrise, Jason and his companions launched the
ship, and, finding a favorable wind, bent the oars to the place that
Medea pointed out, where the fleece was hidden.  When they'd gotten
there, Jason disembarked, and, leaving his companions on the shore
to guard the ship, betook himself with Medea into the woods.  After
advancing a few miles he saw the fleece that he was seeking, hanging
from a tree.  But it was very difficult to carry it off, for not
only was the place well defended by means of both nature and craft,
but a frightful sort of dragon also guarded the tree.  Then Medea,
who, as we have already shown, had a great knowledge of the art of
medicine, broke a branch off a nearby tree and dipped it in poison.
After doing this she approached the tree and sprinkled poison on
the dragon, which was awaiting her arrival with an open maw; then,
when the dragon slept overcome by drowsiness, Jason pulled the golden
fleece down from the tree and retreated with Medea as quickly as
they could.
