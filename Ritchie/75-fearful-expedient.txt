75. A FEARFUL EXPEDIENT

Erat in nāvī Argonautārum fīlius quīdam rēgis Aeëtae, nōmine
Absyrtus, quem, ut suprā dēmōnstrāvimus, Mēdēa ex urbe fugiēns
sēcum abdūxerat. Hunc puerum Mēdēa interficere cōnstituit eō
cōnsiliō, ut membrīs eius in mare coniēctis cursum Colchōrum
impedīret; certō enim sciēbat Aeëtem, cum membra fīlī vīdisset,
nōn longius prōsecutūrum esse. Neque opīniō Mēdēam fefellit,
omnia enim ita ēvēnērunt ut spērāverat. Aeëtēs ubi prīmum
membra vīdit, ad ea colligenda nāvem tenērī iussit. Dum tamen ea
geruntur, Argonautae nōn intermissō remigandī labōre mox ē
conspectū hostium auferēbantur, neque prius fugere dēstitērunt
quam ad flūmen Eridānum pervēnērunt. Aeëtes nihil sibi
prōfutūrum esse arbitrātus sī longius prōgressus esset, animō
dēmissō domum revertit, ut fīlī corpus ad sepultūram daret.

There was on the Argonauts' ship a son of King Aeetes, Absyrtus
by name, whom, as has been shown above, Medea had carried off
while fleeing the city.  Medea decided to kill this boy, in
order to obstruct the course of the Colchorians by flinging his
limbs into the sea; for she surely knew that Aeetes, when he saw
the limbs of his son, would not be able to pursue them further.
And this idea did not disappoint Medea, for everything turned
out just as she had hoped.  When Aeetes first spied the limbs,
he ordered that the ship be halted so that they could be
collected. But while they were being picked up, the Argonauts,
through their uninterrupted effort of rowing, were soon borne
out of their enemy's sight, and did not cease their flight
until they reached the River Eridanus. Aeetes, after deciding 
that he had nothing to gain by going any further, turned back
with a downcast heart, to commit his son's body to the grave.
