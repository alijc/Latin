76. THE BARGAIN WITH PELIAS

Tandem post multa perīcula Iāsōn in eundem locum pervēnit unde
profectus erat. Tum ē nāvī ēgressus ad regem Peliam, quī regnum
adhuc obtinēbat, statim sē contulit, et vellere aureō monstrātō ab eō
postulāvit ut regnum sibi trāderetur; Peliās enim pollicitus erat, sī
Iāsōn vellus rettulisset, sē regnum eī traditūrum. Postquam Iāsōn
quid fierī vellet ostendit, Peliās prīmō nihil respondit, sed diū in
eādem trīstitiā tacitus permansit; tandem ita locūtus est: “Vidēs mē
aetāte iam esse cōnfectum, neque dubium est quīn diēs suprēmus
mihi appropinquet. Liceat igitur mihi, dum vīvam, hoc rēgnum
obtinēre; cum autem tandem dēcesserō, tu mihi succēdēs.” Hāc
oratiōne adductus Iāsōn respondit sē id factūrum quod ille rogāsset.

At last, after many dangers, Jason arrived at the very place from
which he had set out.  Then, after disembarking from the ship, he at
once betook himself to King Pelias, who still held the kingdom, and,
having shown him the golden fleece, he demanded that he surrender the
kingdom; for Pelias had promised that he would hand the kingdom over
to Jason if he brought back the fleece,.  After Jason showed what he
wanted to happen, Pelias at first did not reply, but remained silent
for a long time in the same sorrow; then he spoke thus: "You see that
I have been exhausted by age, and there is no doubt but that my last
days are at hand.  Therefore allow me, while I live, to hold this
kingdom; but when I at last depart from life, you will succeed me."
Jason, persuaded by this speech, replied that what he had requested
would be done.
