78. A DANGEROUS EXPERIMENT

Dum fīliae rēgis hoc mīrāculum stupentēs intuentur, Mēdēa ita
locūta est: “Vidētis quantum valeat medicīna. Vōs igitur, sī vultis
pātrem vestrum in adulēscentiam reducere, id quod fēcī ipsae
faciētis. Vōs pātris membra in vās conicite; ego herbās magicās
praebēbō.” Quod ubi audītum est, fīliae rēgis cōnsilium quod
dedisset Mēdēa nōn ōmittendum putāvērunt. Pātrem igitur Peliam
necāvērunt et membra eius in vās aēneum coniēcērunt; nihil autem
dubitābant quīn hoc maximē eī prōfutūrum esset. At rēs omnīnō
aliter ēvēnit ac sperāverant, Mēdēa enim nōn eāsdem herbās dedit
quibus ipsa ūsa erat. Itaque postquam diū frustrā exspectāvērunt,
pātrem suum rē vērā mortuum esse intellēxērunt. Hīs rēbus gestīs
Mēdēa sē cum coniuge suō rēgnum acceptūram esse sperābat; sed
cīvēs cum intellegerent quō modō Pelias periisset, tantum scelus
aegrē tulērunt. Itaque Iāsone et Mēdēā ē regnō expulsīs, Acastum
rēgem creāvērunt.

While the king's daughters are gazing at this marvel with
astonishment, Medea spoke thusly: "You see how strong the
medicine is.  Therefore you, if you want your father to be
restored to youth, that which I have done - you must do the
same.  Throw your father's limbs into a vessel; I will supply
the magic herbs."  When they heard this, the king's daughters
thought that the advice that Medea had given them should not be
ignored. And so they killed their father Pelias and threw his
limbs into a copper vessel; for they had no doubt that this
would be a great benefit to him.  But the matter turned out
altogether differently from what they had hoped for, because
Medea didn't give them the same herbs that she herself had used.
And so, after fruitlessly waiting for a long time, they realized
that their father was, in fact, dead.  After accomplishing these
things, Medea was looking forward to taking up the kingdom with
her spouse; but when the citizens realized the way in which
Pelias had perished, they bore such a crime ill.  And so Jason
and Medea were expelled from the kingdom and they made Acastus
king.
