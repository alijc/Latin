79. A FATAL GIFT

Iāsōn et Mēdēa ē Thessaliā expulsī ad urbem Corinthum vēnērunt,
cuius urbis Creōn quīdam regnum tum obtinebat. Erat autem
Creōntī fīlia ūna, nōmine Glaucē. Quam cum vīdisset, Iason
cōnstituit Mēdēae uxōrī suae nūntium mittere eō cōnsiliō, ut
Glaucen in mātrimōnium duceret. At Mēdēa ubi intellēxit quae ille
in animō habēret, īrā graviter commōta iūre iurandō confirmāvit sē
tantam iniūriam ultūram. Hoc igitur cōnsilium cēpit. Vestem
parāvit summā arte textam et variīs colōribus infectam; hanc
mortiferō quōdam venēnō tinxit, cuius vīs tālis erat ut sī quis eam
vestem induisset, corpus eius quasi ignī ūrerētur. Hōc factō vestem
ad Glaucen mīsit; illa autem nihil malī suspicāns dōnum libenter
accēpit, et vestem nōvam mōre feminārum statim induit.

After Jason and Medea were driven out of Thessaly they came to the
city of Corinth, in which a certain Creon held the throne.  Now
Creon had one daughter, called Glauce.  After Jason saw her, he
decided to send a letter of divorce to his wife Medea, with the intention
of marrying Glauce.  But when Medea realized what he had in mind,
she was convulsed by a fierce rage and swore an solemn oath of
vengeance for such an injury.  And so she seized on this plan.  
She prepared a garment with the utmost skill, woven and dyed with different
colors; she steeped this in a deadly poison, whose strength was so
great that if anyone put this garment on, their body would seem to
burn with fire.  When this was done she sent the garment to Glauce;
but she, suspecting no evil, accepted the gift gladly, and put the
new garment on at once, as was the custom of women.
