85. THE GIANT'S SUPPER

Cyclōpēs autem pāstōrēs erant quīdam quī īnsulam Siciliam et praecipuē
montem Aetnam incolēbant; ibi enim Volcānus, praeses fabrōrum et ignis
inventor, cuius servī Cyclōpēs erant, officīnam suam habēbat.

Graecī igitur simul ac mōnstrum vīdērunt, terrōre paene exanimātī in
interiōrem partem spēluncae refūgērunt et sē ibi abdere cōnābantur.
Polyphēmus autem (sīc enim Cyclōps appellābatur) pecus suum in
spēluncam compulit; deinde, cum saxō ingentī portam obstrūxisset,
ignem in mediā spēluncā fēcit. Hōc factō, oculō omnia perlūstrabat, et
cum sēnsisset hominēs in interiōre parte spēluncae esse abditōs, magnā
vōce exclāmāvit: "Quī hominēs estis? Mercātōrēs an latrōnēs?" Tum
Ulixēs respondit sē neque mercātōrēs esse neque praedandī causā
vēnisse; sed ā Troiā redeuntēs vī tempestātum ā rectō cursū dēpulsōs
esse. Ōrāvit etiam ut sibi sine iniūriā abīre liceret. Tum Polyphēmus
quaesivit ubi esset nāvis quā vectī essent; sed Ulixēs, cum sibi maximē
praecavendum esse bene intellegeret, respondit nāvem suam in rūpīs
coniectam omnīnō fractam esse. Polyphemus autem nūllō responsō datō
duo ē sociīs manū corripuit, et membrīs eōrum divulsīs carnem devōrāre
coepit.

Now the Cyclopes were certain herdsmen who dwelt on the island of
Sicily, and Mount Etna in particular; for that is where Vulcan, the
protector of smiths and the discoverer of fire, whose servants the
Cyclopes were, had his workshop.

And so as soon as the Greeks had seen the monster, they fled, half dead
with terror, back into the reaches of the cave and tried to hide there.
But Polyphemus (for this is what the Cyclops was called) drove his herd
into the cave; then, after he'd blocked up the entrance with a huge
stone, made a fire in the middle of the cave.  When this was done, he
scrutinized everything with his eye, and when he perceived that men
were hiding in the inner part of the cave, cried out in a loud voice:
"What men are you?  Merchants or robbers?"  Then Ulysses replied that
they were not merchants - nor had they come for the sake of pillage;
but had been driven off course by the force of a storm on their return
from Troy.  He likewise prayed that they might be permitted to depart
without harm. Then Polyphemus asked where the ship was that had
conveyed them; but Ulysses, since he well understood that he had to
take great care, answered that the ship had been flung onto the rocks
and had broken up completely.  But then Polyphemus, having given no
response, snatched up two of Ulysses' companions in his fist, tore them
limb from limb and began to devour them.
