87. A PLAN FOR VENGEANCE

Ortā lūce Polyphēmus iam ē somnō excitātus idem quod hesternō
diē fēcit; correptīs enim duōbus ē reliquīs virīs carnem eōrum sine
morā devōrāvit. Tum, cum saxum āmovisset, ipse cum pecore suō
ex spēluncā progressus est; quod cum Graecī viderent, magnam in
spem sē post paulum ēvāsūrōs vēnērunt. Mox tamen ab hāc spē
repulsī sunt; nam Polyphēmus, postquam omnēs ovēs exiērunt,
saxum in locum restituit. Reliquī omnī spē salūtis dēpositā lamentīs
lacrimīsque sē dedērunt; Ulixēs vērō, quī, ut suprā
dēmōnstrāvimus, vir magnī fuit cōnsilī, etsī intellegēbat rem in
discrīmine esse, nōndum omnīnō desperābat. Tandem, postquam
diū haec tōtō animō cogitāvit, hoc cōnsilium cēpit. Ē lignīs quae in
spēluncā rēposita erant palum magnum dēlēgit. Hunc summā cum
dīligentiā praeacutum fēcit; tum, postquam sociīs quid fierī vellet
ostendit, redītum Polyphemī exspectābat.

At first light Polyphemus rose from his sleep and did the same
as on the previous day; for he seized two of the remaining men and
devoured their flesh without delay.  Then, after he'd moved the
stone, he himself proceeded out of the cave with his flock; when
the Greeks saw this, they fell into a great hope of escaping after
a bit.  But they were shortly disabused of this hope; for after all
of the sheep had gone out Polyphemus restored the stone to its
place.  The remaining men, despairing of all hope of salvation,
surrendered themselves to weeping and wailing; but Ulysses, who, as
we have already shown, was a man of great intelligence, had not yet
completelly given up hope, even though he recognized that the
business was in a crisis.  Nevertheless, after he had pondered long
and hard on this, he adopted this plan.  From the firewood that had
been stored in the cave he selected a long stake.  This he sharpened
with the greatest care; then, after he had shown his comrades what
he wanted done, he waited for Polyphemus' return.
