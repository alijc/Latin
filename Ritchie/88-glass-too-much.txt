88. A GLASS TOO MUCH

Sub vesperum Polyphēmus ad spēluncam rediit, et eōdem modō
quō anteā cēnāvit. Tum Ulixēs utrem vīnī prompsit, quem forte (id
quod eī erat salūtī) sēcum attulerat; et postquam magnum pōculum
vīnō complēvit, mōnstrum ad bibendum provocāvit. Polyphēmus,
quī numquam anteā vīnum gustāverat, tōtum pōculum statim
exhausit; quod cum fēcisset, tantam voluptātem percēpit ut iterum
et tertium pōculum rēplērī iusserit. Tum, cum quaesīvisset quō
nōmine Ulixēs appellārētur, ille respondit sē Neminem appellārī;
quod cum audīvisset, Polyphēmus ita locūtus est: “Hanc tibi
grātiam prō tantō beneficiō referam; tē postrēmum omnium
dēvorābō.” Hoc cum dīxisset, cibō vīnōque gravis recubuit et brevī
tempore somnō oppressus est. Tum Ulixēs sociīs convocātīs,
"Habēmus," inquit, "quam petīvimus facultātem; nē igitur tantam
occāsiōnem reī gerendae omittāmus."

Towards evening Polyphemus returned to the cave, and dined the
same way as before.  Then Ulysses brought out a skin of wine that
he had fortuitously brought with him (this was his salvation);
and after filling a huge bowl, he challenged the monster to
drink it.  Polyphemus, who had never before tasted wine, drained
the whole bowl at once. After he'd done that, he felt such a
great delight that he commanded a second bowl, and then a third,
to be filled.  Then, when he inquired what Ulysses' name was,
he replied that he was called "Nobody".  When Polyphemus
heard this, he said: "I will tender you this favor for such a
great kindness; I'll eat you last of all."  After he'd said this,
he lay down, heavy with food and wine, and was shortly overwhelmed
by sleep.  The Ulysses called his companions together and said,
"We have the opportunity that we wanted; therefore let us not lay
aside so good a chance of carrying out the business."
