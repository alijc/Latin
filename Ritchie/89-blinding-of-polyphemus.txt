89. THE BLINDING OF POLYPHEMUS

Hāc oratiōne habitā, postquam extrēmum palum ignī calefēcit, oculum
Polyphemī dormientis ferventī lignō perfōdit; quō factō omnēs in
diversās spēluncae partēs sē abdidērunt. At ille subitō illō dolōre oculī ē
somnō excitātus clāmōrem terribilem sustulit, et dum per spēluncam
errat, Ulixem manū prehendere cōnābātur; cum tamen iam omnīnō caecus
esset, nūllō modō hoc efficere potuit. Intereā reliquī Cyclōpēs, clāmōre
audītō, undique ad spēluncam convēnērunt, et ad introitum adstantēs quid
Polyphēmus ageret quaesīverunt, et quam ob causam tantum clāmōrem
sustulisset. Ille respondit sē graviter vulnerātum esse et magnō dolōre
adficī. Cum tamen posteā quaesīvissent quis ei vim intulisset, respondit
ille Neminem id fēcisse; quibus rēbus auditīs ūnus ē Cyclōpibus: “At sī
nēmō,” inquit, “tē vulnerāvit, haud dubium est quīn cōnsiliō deōrum,
quibus resistere nec possumus nec volumus, hōc suppliciō adficiāris.”
Hoc cum dīxisset, abiērunt Cyclōpēs eum in insāniam incidisse arbitrātī.

After this speech was over, and after he'd heated the end of the stake
in the fire, Ulysses stabbed the sleeping Polyphemus in the eye with
the burning wood. While this took place everyone hid in different
parts of the cave.  But Polyphemus, jerked from sleep by the pain in
his eye, raised a frightful roar, and blundering through the cave,
tried to catch Ulysses in his fist; but since he was by now
completely blind, he couldn't accomplish this no how.  In the meantime
the rest of the Cyclopes heard the uproar and converged on the cave
from every direction, and, standing at the entrance, asked Polyphemus
what was going on and what he was raising such a ruckus for. He
answered that he was gravely wounded and afflicted with great
pain. But when they then asked who had offered him violence, he
replied that Nobody had done it.  When they heard this, one of the
Cyclopes said, "But if nobody has wounded you, then doubtless it was
the decision of the gods.  And opposing them is something we neither 
can do or wish to.  You must suffer this punishment."  After he'd said 
this, the Cyclopes left, having decided that he had fallen into insanity.
