92. THE COUNTRY OF THE WINDS

Pauca mīlia passuum ab eō locō prōgressus Ulixēs ad īnsulam
Aeoliam nāvem appulit. Haec patria erat ventōrum,
“Hīc vastō rēx Aeolus antrō
luctantēs ventōs tempestatēsque sonōrās
imperiō premit ac vinclīs et carcere frēnat.”
Ibi rēx ipse Graecōs hospitiō excēpit, atque eīs persuāsit ut ad
recuperandās vīrēs paucōs diēs in eā regiōne commorārentur.
Septimō diē, cum sociī ē labōribus sē rēcēpissent, Ulixēs, nē annī
tempore ā nāvigātiōne excluderētur, sibi sine morā proficīscendum
statuit. Tum Aeolus, quī sciēbat Ulixem cupidissimum esse patriae
videndae, ei iam profectūrō magnum saccum e coriō cōnfectum
dedit, in quō ventōs omnēs praeter ūnum inclūserat. Zephyrum
tantum solverat, quod ille ventus ab īnsulā Aeoliā ad Ithacam
navigantī est secundus. Ulixēs hoc dōnum libenter accēpit, et
grātiīs prō tantō beneficiō actīs saccum ad mālum alligāvit. Tum
omnibus rēbus ad profectiōnem parātīs meridiānō ferē tempore ē
portū solvit.

After advancing a few miles from that place, Ulysses put the ship
ashore at the island of Aeolia.  This was the homeland of the
winds, "Here, in a vast cavern, King Aeolus overwhelms the
struggling winds and thundering storms with his power and
restrains them with chains and bars."

There the king himself received the Greeks with hospitality, and
persuaded them to linger for a few days to restore their strength.
On the seventh day, when the company had recovered from their
hardship, Ulysses, for fear that the season of year would prevent
his sailing, decided to himself to set out without delay.  Then
Aeolus, who knew that Ulysses was most eager to see his homeland,
now gave him, on the verge of his departure, a large bag made of
sow's hide, in which he had shut up every wind but one.  He'd
released only the West Wind, because that's a favorable wind for
sailing from the island of Aeolia to Ithica. Ulysses gladly
accepted this gift, and, after giving thanks for such a kindness,
tied the bag to the mast.  Then, when everything had been readied
for their departure, they sailed out of the port just before noon.
