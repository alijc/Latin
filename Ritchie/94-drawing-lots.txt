94. A DRAWING OF LOTS

Brevī spatiō intermissō, Graecī īnsulae cuidam appropinquāvērunt
in quā Circē, fīlia Sōlis, habitābat. Quō cum nāvem appulisset,
Ulixēs in terram frumentandī causā ēgrediendum esse statuit; nam
cognōverat frūmentum quod in nāvī habērent iam dēficere. Sociīs
igitur ad sē convocātīs quō in locō rēs esset et quid fierī vellet
ostendit. Cum tamen omnēs memoriā tenērent quam crudelī morte
necātī essent eī quī nuper ē nāvī ēgressī essent, nēmō repertus est
quī hoc negōtium suscipere vellet. Quae cum ita essent, rēs ad
contrōversiam dēducta est. Tandem Ulixēs consensū omnium
sociōs in duās partēs divīsit, quārum alterī Eurylochus, vir summae 
virtūtis, alterī ipse praeesset. Tum hī inter sē sortītī sunt ūter in
terram ēgrederētur. Hōc factō, Eurylochō sorte ēvēnit ut cum
duōbus et vigintī sociīs rem susciperet.

After a short stretch of time the Greeks approached a certain
island on which Circe, the daughter of the Sun, lived.  When the
ship put ashore there, Ulysses decided that they had to
disembark in order to forage; for he'd realized that the
foodstuffs that they had onboard were running low.  Therefore he
assembled his comrades and pointed out how the matter lay and
what he wanted to be done.  But since everyone held in memory
how those who disembarked from the ship had not long before had
been murdered by a cruel death, no one was found who wanted to
undertake this task.  Because of this, the matter turned into a
quarrel. At last Ulysses, with the consent of everyone, divided
his companions into two parts, one of which was to be led by
Eurylochus, a man of great courage, and the other by himself.
Then they cast lots among themselves for which group would
disembark.  When this was done, it came out that the fate fell
to Eurylochus to undertake the business with two and twenty of
their companions.
