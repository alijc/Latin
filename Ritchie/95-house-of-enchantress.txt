95. THE HOUSE OF THE ENCHANTRESS

Hīs rēbus ita constitutīs eī quī sortītī erant in interiōrem partem
īnsulae profectī sunt. Tantus tamen timor animōs eōrum
occupāverat ut nihil dubitārent quīn mortī obviam īrent. Vix
quidem poterant eī quī in nāvī relictī erant lacrimās tenēre;
credēbant enim sē sociōs suōs numquam post hoc tempus visūrōs.
Illī autem aliquantum itineris progressī ad villam quandam
pervēnērunt summā magnificentiā aedificātam, cuius ad ōstium
cum adiissent, cantum dulcissimum audīvērunt. Tanta autem fuit
eius vocis dulcēdō ut nūllō modō retinērī possent quīn ianuam
pulsārent. Hōc factō ipsa Circē forās exiit, et summā cum
benignitāte omnēs in hospitium invītāvit. Eurylochus īnsidiās sibi
comparārī suspicātus forīs exspectāre cōnstituit, sed reliquī reī
novitāte adductī intrāvērunt. Cēnam magnificam omnibus rēbus
instrūctam invēnērunt et iussū dominae libentissimē accubuērunt.
At Circē vīnum quod servī apposuērunt medicāmentō quōdam
miscuerat; quod cum bibissent, gravī somnō subitō oppressī sunt.

When these matters had been resolved in this way, those who had
been chosen set out into the interior of the the island.  But
such fear had seized their hearts that they had no doubt but
that they were marching to their deaths.  Indeed, those who had
been left on the ship could scarcely hold back their tears; for
they were sure that they would never see their companions
again.  But after they'd proceeded a little ways along the road
they came to a villa that had been built with the utmost
splendor.  And after they'd approached the door they heard the
most delightful singing.  But the sweetness of this voice was so
great that there was no way that they could keep from beating on
the door.  After this happened Circe herself went outside, and
with the greatest courtesy invited them all in as her guests.
Eurylochus, suspicious that treachery was being prepared, decided
to wait outside, but the rest entered, drawn by the novelty of
the affair.  They found a magnificent dinner, fitted out with
everything, and, on the command of the hostess, most gladly sat
down to eat. But Circe had mixed some drug into the wine that the
slaves served; because after the Greeks had drunk it, they
were suddenly overwhelmed by a heavy sleep.
