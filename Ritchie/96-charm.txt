96. THE CHARM

Tum Circē, quae artis magicae summam scientiam habēbat, baculō
aureō quod gerēbat capita eōrum tetigit; quō factō omnēs in porcōs
subitō conversī sunt. Intereā Eurylochus ignārus quid in aedibus
agerētur ad ōstium sedēbat; postquam tamen ad sōlis occāsum
anxiō animō et sollicitō exspectāvit, sōlus ad nāvem regredī
constituit. Eō cum vēnisset, sollicitūdine ac timōre tam perturbātus
fuit ut quae vīdisset vix dīlūcidē narrāre posset. Ulixēs autem satis
intellēxit sociōs suōs in periculō versārī, et gladiō correptō
Eurylochō imperāvit ut sine morā viam ad istam domum
dēmōnstrāret. Ille tamen multīs cum lacrimīs Ulixem complexus
obsecrāre coepit nē in tantum periculum sē committeret; sī quid
gravius eī accidisset, omnium salūtem in summō discrīmine
futūram. Ulixēs autem respondit sē nēminem invītum sēcum
adductūrum; eī licēre, sī mallet, in nāvī manēre; sē ipsum sine ūllō
praesidiō rem susceptūrum. Hoc cum magnā vōce dīxisset, ē nāvī
dēsiluit et nūllō sequente sōlus in viam sē dedit.

Then Circe, who had the ultimate knowledge of the art of magic,
struck them on the head with the golden staff that she was carrying.
After this they were all suddenly transformed into pigs.  In the
meantime Eurylochus was sitting by the front door, unaware of what
was happening inside the house; but after he had waited until
sundown with an anxious and a worried heart, he decided to go back
to the ship by himself.  When he got there, he was so alarmed with
anxiety and dread that he could barely relate the things that he had
seen in a lucid way.  But Ulysses understood well enough that his
companions were in danger, and, seizing his sword, commanded
Eurylochus to show them the way to the house without delay.  But he,
with many tears, clung to Ulysses and began to beseech him not to
entrust himself to such danger; if anything more serious were to
happen to him, the well-being of everyone would be in a most acute
crisis.  But Ulysses replied that he wasn't about to take anyone
with him against their will.  Eurylochus would be allowed, if he
wished, to remain on the ship.  He himself would undertake the
matter without any help.  After he said this in a loud voice, he
leapt down from the ship and, with no one following, applied himself
to the road.
