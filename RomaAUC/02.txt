Rex Latinus Aeneam recipit

Latinus, Aboriginum rex, cum ei nuntiatum esset multitudinem
advenarum classe advectam, occupavisse agrum Laurentem, adversum
subitos inopinatosque hostes sine mora suas copias eduxit.
Priusquam signum dimicandi daret, suspenso certamine, quaesvit qui
essent quidve peterent. Deinde cum cognovisset Aeneam, bello patria
pulsum et cum simulacris deorum errantem, sedem quaerere, amicitiam
foedere iniit, dato invicem iure iurando ut communes hostes amicosve
haberent.


King Latinus takes Aeneas in

After was announced to Latinus, the king of the Aborigines,
that a great number of foreigners had been brought by ship
and were occupying the territory of Laurentum, he led his troops
out against the sudden and unexpected enemy without delay.
Before giving the signal for battle, with combat in question,
he asked who they were and what they wanted.
Then, when he realized that Aeneas, driven out of his native land by war
and wandering with the statues of his gods, sought a home,
he undertook an alliance with a treaty, each giving an oath in turn
that they would hold their friends and enemies in common.
