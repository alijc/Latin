Bellum Turni cum Aenea

Itaque ibi coeperunt Troiani munire locum, quem Aeneas ex nomine
uxoris suae, Latini regis filiae, quae iam ante desponsa Turno
fuerat, Lavinium nominavit. At vero Amata, Latini regis uxor, cum
indigne ferret Laviniam, repudiato Turno consobrino suo, Troiano
advenae collocatam esse, Turnum ad arma concitavit. Isque mox, coacto
Rutulorum exercitu, tetendit in agrum Laurentem. Et Latinus, adversus
eum pariter cum Aenea progressus inter proeliantes, circumventus est
occisusque. Nec tamen, amisso socero, Aeneas Rutulis obsistere
destitit, tandemque Turnum interemit. Hostibus fusis fugatisque,
victor Lavinium se cum suis recepit, consensuque omnium
Latinorum rex declaratus est.


Turnus' War with Aeneas

And so there the Trojans set about to fortify the spot, which Aeneas
called Lavinium, from the name of his wife, King Latinus' daughter,
who had formerly been betrothed to Turnus.  And indeed, Amata, King
Latinus' wife, roused Turnus to arms, since she felt that it was
unworthy for Lavinia to be wed to the Trojan foreigner, with her
cousin Turnus being rejected.  And he soon gathered the army of the
Rutulians and encamped on Laurentian soil.  And Latinus, opposing
him, after having advanced, together with Aeneas, among the fighters,
was surrounded and killed.  Nevertheless, even after losing his
father-in-law, Aeneas didn't leave off his resistance to the
Rutulians, and killed Turnus in the end.  After the enemy was
scattered and put to flight, the victor returned to Lavinium with his
men, and was declared king by the consensus of all the Latins.
