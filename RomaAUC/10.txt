Hannibalis res gestae

Hannibal, Hamilcaris filius, novem annos natus, a patre arae admotus,
odium in Romanos perenne iuravit.  Exinde socius et miles in castris
patri fuit.  Mortuo eo, causam belli quaerens, Saguntum Romanis
foederatum intra sex menses evertit.  Tum, relicto in Hispania fratre
Hasdrubale, Pyrenaeum transiit et, Alpibus patefactis, in Italiam
exercitum traiecit.  Ibi P. Cornelius Scipio consul ei apud flumen
Ticinum occurrit atque, cum proelium commisisset, fugatis suis, ipse
vulneratus in castra rediit.  Paucos post dies Ti. Sempronius Longus
alter consulum conflixit apud Trebiam amnem; is quoque victus est.
Proxima aestate Hannibal apud Trasimenum lacum Gaium Flaminium
consulem et Romanorum viginti quinque milia interemit.  Postremo
L. Aemilius Paullus et C. Terentius Varro contra Hannibalem missi
sunt et, cum in Apulia apud vicum qui Cannae appellatur pugnatum
esset, ambo consules ab Hannibale victi sunt et Paullus cum Romanorum
quinquaginta milibus periit.

Tum Hannibal, cum urbem capere posset, in Campaniam devertit, cuius
deliciis elanguit.  Postea, primum a Q. Fabio Maximo frustratus,
deinde a P. Valerio Flacco repulsus, postremo a Ti. Sempronio Graccho
et M. Claudio Marcello e Campania fugatus est.  Et cum ad tertium ab
urbe lapidem castra posuisset, tempestatibus repulsus est.  Tandem in
Africam revocatus et a Scipione apud Zamam superatus, ad Antiochum
regem Syriae confugit eumque hostem Romanis fecit.  Quo victo, ad
Prusiam regem Bithyniae concessit.  Unde Romana legatione repetitus,
hausto veneno quod sub gemma anuli habebat, absumptus est.  Positus
est apud Libyssam in arca lapidea, in qua hodie etiam inscriptum est:
"Hannibal hic situs est."


Hannibal's deeds

Hannibal, the son of Hamilcar, was brought to the altar at the age of
nine by his father and swore everlasting hatred towards the Romans.
After that he became a companion and soldier in camp with his father.
Within six months of Hamilcar's death, Hannibal, seeking a reason for
war, overthrew Saguntum, which was allied with the Romans.  Then,
leaving his brother Hasdrubal in Spain, he crossed the Pyrenees and,
after opening up the Alps, transported his army into Italy.  There
the consul P. Cornelius Scipioto met him at the River Ticinus and,
after engaging in battle, retreated to camp, with his men put to
flight and himself wounded.  A few days later, the other consul,
Ti. Sempronius Longus, fought at the River Trebia; and was likewise
beaten.  The next summer Hannibal destroyed consul Gaius Flaminius
and twenty-five thousand Romans at Lake Trasimenum.  Finally
L. Aemilius Paullus and C. Terentius Varro were sent against
Hannibal; and, when a battle was fought in Apud at the village that is
called Cannae, both consuls were defeated by Hannibal and Paullus
perished with fifty thousand Roman solders.

Hannibal could have captured the city then, but instead turned aside
to Campania and relaxed in its pleasures.  Later, first frustrated by
Q. Fabius Maximus, then driven back by P. Valerius Flaccus, he was
finally forced to flee Campania by Ti. Sempronius Gracchus and
M. Claudius Marcellus.  And after he had pitched camp three miles
from the city, he was driven out by storms.  Then he was recalled to
Africa and defeated at Zama by Scipio, and he fled to Antiochus, the
king of Syria, and made him an enemy of the Romans.  And when he was
defeated, he withdrew to Prusias, the king of Bithynia.  After the
Roman legation again demanded him from there, he swallowed poison
that he had under the jewel of his ring, and was done in.  He was
buried at Libyssa in a stone coffin, on which today is still written:
"Hannibal is situated here."
