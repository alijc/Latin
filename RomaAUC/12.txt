Scipionis Africani vita

Publius Scipio ex virtute Africanus dictus, Iovis filius credebatur.
Nam antequam conciperetur, serpens in lecto matris eius apparuit, et
postea ipsi parvulo draco circumfusus nihil nocuit.  In Capitolium
intempesta nocte euntem numquam canes latraverunt.  Nec hic quicquam
prius coepit quam in cella Iovis diutissime sedisset, quasi divinam
mentem acciperet.  Decem et octo annos natus, patrem apud Ticinum
singulari virtute servavit.  Postea, clade Cannensi nobilissimos
iuvenes, Italiam deserere cupientes, sua auctoritate compescuit et
incolumes per media hostium castra Cansuium perduxit.

Viginti quattuor annos natus, cum imperio proconsulari in Hispaniam
missus, Novam Carthaginem, qua die venit, cepit.  Ibi virginem
pulcherrimam, ad cuius aspectum concurrebatur, ad se vetuit adduci
patrique eius reddidit.  Cum Hasdrubalem Magonemque, fratres
Hannibalis, ex Hispania expulisset, victor ex Hispania domum
regressus et consul ante annum suum factus, in Africam classem
traiecit.  Ibi amicitiam cum rege Numidarum Masinissa iam
coniunxerat.  Cuius auxilio usus, Hannibalem ex Italia revocatum
superavit et victis Carthaginiensibus leges imposuit.

Decem post annos, bello Antiochi, legatus fratri fuit atque filium
suum a rege captum gratis recepit, Romam reversus, fratre a Catone
repetundarum accusato, librum rationum in conspectu populi scidit.
"Hac die," inquit, "Carthaginem vici.  Quare in Capitolium eamus et
diis supplicemus."  Inde, populum ingratum indignatus, in
voluntarium exsilium concessit, ubi reliquam egit aetatem.  Moriens
autem ab uxore petiit ne corpus suum Romam referretur.


The life of Scipio Africanus

Publius Scipio, called Africanus for his courage, was considered
to be the son of Jupiter.  For before he was conceived, a serpent
appeared to his mother in her bed, and afterwards, when he was quite
small, a snake draped around him did him no harm at all.  When he
walked on the Capitoline Hill in the dead of night, dogs never
barked at him.  And this man never undertook anything until he had
sat for a very long time in the shrine of Jupiter, as if he was
receiving divine understanding.  At the age of eighteen, at Ticinus,
he protected his father with unmatched courage.  Later, at the
defeat at Cannae, by his own authority, he blocked the very noble
young men from leaving Italy and led them safely through the middle
of the enemy camp to Canusium.

At twenty-four years old, sent with a proconsular command into
Spain, he captured New Carthage on the same day that he arrived.
There he prevented a most beautiful maiden, that people would flock
to look at, from being given to him, and returned her to her father.
After he drove Hasdrubal and Mago, Hannibal's brothers, out of
Spain, he returned from from Spain as a conqueror, was made consul
before the legal age, and took a fleet to Africa. He had already
formed a friendship with King Masinissa of Numidia there.
Making use of his aid, he conquered Hannibal, who'd been called back
from Italy, and imposed laws on the defeated Carthagians.

Ten years later, he was his brother's officer in the war against
Antiochus, and recovered his son, who'd been captured by the king,
as a favor.  After his return to Rome, when his brother was accused
of financial misconduct by Cato, he openly tore up the account
books.  "On this day," he said, "I conquered Carthage.  Therefore,
let us go to the Capitoline Hill and pray to the gods."  Then,
scorning the ungrateful populace, he went into voluntary exile,
where he passed the rest of his life.  And when he was dying he
begged his wife not to have his corpse carried back to Rome.
