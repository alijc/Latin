Catonis ingenium

M. igitur Cato idem summus imperator, idem sapiens, idem orator,
idem historiae conditor, idem iuris, idem rerum rusticarum
peritissimus fuit.  Quem virum, di boni!  Quis illo gravior in
laudando, acerbior in vituperando, in sententiis argutior, in
docendo edisserendoque subtilior?  In omnibus rebus singulari
fuit industria.  Inter tot operas militiae, tantas domi
contentiones, rudi saeculo, litteras Graecas, aetate iam
declinata, didicit.  Quarum studium etsi senior adripuerat,
tamen tantum progressum fecit, ut nihil facile reperiri possit,
neque de Graecis neque de Italicis rebus, quod ei fuerit
incognitum.  Ab adulescentia confecit orationes, quae refertae
sunt et verbis et rebus illustribus.  Senex historias scribere
instituit; earum sunt libri septem.  Liber primus continet res
gestas regum populi Romani, secundus et tertius unde quaeque
civitas orta sit Italica, ob quam rem omnes Origines videtur
appellasse.  In quarto autem est bellum Punicum primum, in
quinto secundum; atque haec omnia capitulatim sunt dicta.  In
iisdem exposuit quae in Italia Hispaniisque aut fierent aut
viderentur admiranda; in quibus multa industria et diligentia
comparet, nulla doctrina.  Reliqua quoque bella pari modo
persecutus est usque ad praeturam Servii Galbae, qui diripuit
Lusitanos.  Atque horum bellorum omnium duces non nominavit, sed
sine nominibus r√¶ notavit.  Elephantum tamen, qui fortissime
proeliatus esset in Punica acie, Surum tradidit vocatum, altero
dente mutilato.

 
The character of Cato

M. Cato was, therefore, at once an outstanding commander, a wise
man, an orator, an author of histories, a justice, and most
experienced in rural matters.  Good gods! but what a man!  Who
was more serious than he in praise, harsher in reproach, more
eloquent in opinions, more thorough in teaching and explaining?
He had a unique diligence in all matters.  In the midst of such
great military service and domestic strife, in a rough age, and
in the decline of his life, he learned Greek.  Although he had
taken up this study as a senior citizen, nevertheless he made so
much progress that nothing can be easily found, either about
Greek or Italian matters, that he didn't know about.  From his
youth he prepared speeches, filled with brilliant words and
matters.  As an old man he decided to write histories; there
were seven books of them.  The first book contains the military
deeds of the kings of the Roman people, and the second and third
were about whichever city Italy must have risen from, on account
of which he seems to have called the whole work "Origins".  But
the first Punic War is in the fourth, the second in the fifth;
and all these things are stated by headings.  In the same books
he set forth what was or seemed remarkable in Italy and Spain;
much purposefulness and diligence appears in them, but no
education.  He also followed the remaining wars in a like way,
up to the praetorship of Servius Galba, who laid waste to the
Lusitanians.  Now he didn't name any of the leaders of all these
wars, but recorded their deeds without names.  Nevertheless he
deigned to call one elephant, that had fought most powerly in
the Punic battle line, Tusker, as one of its tusks had been
chopped off.
