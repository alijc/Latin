Marius consulatum petit

Bello Iugurthino, Uticae forte C. Mario, legato Metelli, per
hostias diis supplicanti, magna atque mirabilia portendi haruspex
dixit.  At illum iam antea consulatus ingens cupido exagitabat, ad
quem capiendum, praeter vetustatem familiae, alia omnia abunde ei
erant: industria, probitas, belli magna scientia; animus militiae
ingens, domi modicus, libidinis et divitiarum victor, tantum modo
gloriae avidus.  Ubi primum tribunatum militarem a populo petit,
plerisque faciem eius ignorantibus, factis notus per omnis tribus
declaratur.  Deinde ab eo magistratu alium post alium sibi
peperit.  Tamen is ad id tempus consulatum appetere non audebat.
Etiam tum alios magistratus plebs, consulatum nobilitas inter se
per manus tradebat.  Novus nemo tam clarus neque tam egregiis
factis erat, quin is indignus illo honore haberetur.

Igitur ubi Marius haruspicis dicta eodem intendere videt quo cupido
animi hortabatur, ab Metello petendi gratia missionem rogat; cui
quamquam virtus, gloria, atque alia optanda bonis superabant, tamen
inerat contemptor animus et superbia, commune nobilitatis malum.
Itaque primum, commotus insolita re, mirari eius consilium et quasi
per amicitam monere ne tam prava inciperet.  Postquam haec atque
alia talia dixit neque animus Mari flectitur, respondit, ubi primum
potuisset per negotia publica, facturum sese quae peteret.  Ac
postea saepius eadem postulanti fertur dixisse ne festinaret abire;
satis mature illum cum filio suo consulatum petiturum.  Is eo
tempore contubernio patris ibidem militabat, annos natus circiter
viginti.  Quae res Marium, cum pro honore quem adfectabat tum
contra Metellum, vehementer accenderat.  Ita cupidine atque ira,
pessimis consultoribus, grassari; neque facto ullo neque dicto
abstinere, quod modo ambitiosum foret.


Marius reaches for the consulship

By chance in Utica, during the Jugurthine War, while C. Marius,
Metellus' deputy, was supplicating the gods with sacrifices, the
diviner spoke to him, predicting great and wonderful things for
him.  But even before that a great desire for the consulship had
stirred in him.  He had everything, save for the antiquity of his
family, in abundance to get it: diligence, honesty, great miltary
skill; a remarkable spirit in war, but restrained in peace,
victorious over the desire for wealth, desirous only for glory.
When he first sought the military tribuneship from the people the
majority of them didn't know him from Adam, but through his deeds
he became well-known through all the tribes.  Then, from this
office he next obtained another for himself.  Yet up to that time
he hadn't dared to seek the consulship.  Then too, the common people
awarded other offices, while the nobility granted the consulship
from hand to hand among themselves.  No new man was so illustrious
or marked by such distiguished deeds that he would be deemed
worthy of that honor.

And so when Marius thought that the diviner's words extended to the
same place where his heart's desire urged, he asked Metellus to
dismiss him and so he could run for office; although he had an
abundance of courage, fame, and other things desired by the
quality, nevertheless a scornful spirit and pride was in him,
a common evil of the nobility.  And so at first,
jolted by this unexpected event, Metellus was shocked at his
plan and warned him, as a friend, not to start such improper
doings.  After he said this and other such things, and Marius's
heart was not swayed, he replied that he'd do what Marius had
asked, as soon as his duties allowed.  And afterwards he was led,
more than once, to tell him not to hurry to depart; there was still
time enough for him to run for the consulship, along with his son.
At the time his son was about twenty years old and was serving as a
soldier in the same place, and was his father's tent-mate.  This
lit a fire under Marius, not only for the honor that he was
aspiring to, but also against Metellus.  Thus he proceeded
with desire and rage - the worst advisors -; and refrained from no deed
or word that might possibly further his ambition.
