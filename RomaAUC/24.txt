Bellum civile primum, a Marianis atque Sulla gestum

Per ea tempora Mithridates -- Ponticus rex, bello acerrimus,
virtute eximius, aliquando fortuna, semper animo maximus,
consiliis dux, miles manu, odio in Romanos Hannibal -- occupata
Asia necatisque in ea omnibus civibus Romanis, cum terribilis
Italiae quoque videretur imminere, sorte obvenit Sullae Asia
provincia.

Hoc deerat unum populi Romani malis, ut iam ipse intra se
parricidale telum domi stringeret.  Initium et causa belli
inexplebilis honorum Marii fames, quippe qui decretam Sullae
provinciam Sulpicia lege sollicitaret.  Sed, impatiens iniuriae,
statim Sulla legiones circumegit et urbi agmen infudit; arcemque
Capitolii, quae Poenos quoque, quae Gallos etiam evaserat, quasi
captivam victor insedit.

Deinde duodecim auctores novarum pessimarumque rerum, inter quos
Marius cum filio et P. Sulpicio, urbe exturbavit; ac, lege lata,
exsules fecit.  Sulpicium adsecuti equites in Laurentinis
paludibus iugulavere, caputque eius erectum et ostentatum pro
rostris, velut omen imminentis proscriptionis, fuit.  Marius
nudus ac limo obrutus, oculis tantum modo ac naribus eminentibus,
extractus harundineto circa paludem Maricae, in quam se, fugiens
consectantis Sullae equites, abdiderat, iniecto in collum loro,
in carcerem Mintumemium iussu duumviri perductus est.  Ad quem
interficiendum missus gladio servus publicus, natione Germanus,
qui forte ab imperatore eo bello Cimbrico captus erat, ut agnovit
Marium, magno eiulatu expromens indignationem casus tanti viri,
abiecto gladio, profugit e carcere.  Tum cives, ab hoste misereri
paulo ante principis viri docti, instructum eum viatico
conlataque veste in navem imposuerunt.  At ille, absecutus circa
insulam Aenariam filium, cursum in Africam direxit inopemque
vitam in tugurio inter ruinas Carthaginis toleravit, ita ut
Marius aspiciens Carthaginem, illa intuens Marium, alter alteri
possent esse solacio.


The first civil war, waged by the Marians and Sulla

During the time that Mithridates -- king of Pontus, severe in
war, remarkable in strength, at times in fortune, always the
greatest in spirit, a leader in planning, a soldier in combat, a
Hannibal in hatred against the Romans -- after seizing Asia and
killing all the Roman citizens in it, likewise terrifyingly
seemed to threaten Italy, the province of Asia fell to Sulla
by lot.

For the Roman people only one evil was now lacking: for them to 
draw murderous weapons at home among themselves.  The beginning
and cause of the war was Marius' insatiable craving for honors,
for he naturally tried to get Sulla's decreed province by means
of the Sulpician law.  But, intolerant of the injustice, Sulla at
once wheeled his legions about and marched his army into the
city; and seized, as a conqueror does the conquered, the citadel
of the Capitoline, which had escaped the Carthaginians, and even
the Gauls.

Then Sulla drove the twelve instigators of the new and terrible
affairs, among them Marius, his son, and P. Sulpicus, out of the
city; and, after proposing a law, exiled them.  Horsemen pursued
Sulpicius and butchered him in the Laurentine marshes, and his
head was hung up and displayed before the rostrums, like a sign
of imminent proscription.  Marius, naked and covered in mire with
only his eyes and nostrils exposed, was dragged out of the
reed-bed that borders the Marican marsh where he, fleeing from
Sulla's pursuing cavalrymen, had hidden.  With a leather strap
thrown around his neck, he was conducted into prison at the
command of the two magistrates of the Mintumemians.  A
state-owned slave, German in nationality, was sent to kill him
with a sword.  By chance this man had been captured by Marius
when he was a general in the Cimbrican war, and when he
recognized Marius, he emitted a great wailing to show his
indignation at the plight of such a man, cast away his sword, and
ran out of the prison.  Then the citizens, who had been taught by
the enemy to show mercy for a man who'd been a leader only a
little before, put him, fitted out with travelling money and
clothing that they'd collected, on board a ship.  But he, after
following his son away around the Aenarian island, set a course
for Africa and endured a destitute life in a cottage among the
ruins of Carthage.  As Marius gazed at Carthage, Carthage
regarded Marius, and each one could be a solace to the other.
