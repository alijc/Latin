Ciceronis de Mario, Cinna, et Sulla duae sententiae

Neque enim ullus alius discordiarum solet esse exitus inter claros
et potentes viros nisi aut universus interitus aut victoris
dominatus vel regnum. Dissensit cum Mario, clarissimo cive, consul
nobilissimus et fortissimus, L. Sulla; horum uterque ita cecidit
victus, ut victor idem regnaverit. Cum Octavio collega Cinna
dissedit; utrique horum secunda fortuna regnum est largita,
adversa mortem. Idem iterum Sulla superavit; tum sine dubio habuit
regalem potestatem, quamquam rem publicam recuperarat.

Etenim recordamini, Quirites, omnis civilis dissensiones, non
solum eas quas audistis sed eas quas vosmet ipsi meministis atque
vidistis. L. Sulla P. Sulpicium oppressit; eiecit ex urbe
C. Marium, custodem huius urbis, multosque fortes viros partim
eiecit ex civitate, partim interemit.  Cn. Octavius consul armis
ex urbe expulit collegam; omnis hic locus acervis corporum et
civium sanguine redundavit.  Superavit postea Cinna cum Mario; tum
vero, clarissimis viris interfectis, lumina civitatis extincta
sunt.  Ultus est huius victoriae crudelitatem postea Sulla â€” ne
dici quidem opus est quanta deminutione civium et quanta
calamitate rei publicae.  L. Cinna crudelis, C. Marius in
iracundia perseverans, L. Sulla vehemens; atque quid eorum
victoria crudelius, quid funestius?


Two opinions of Cicero on Marius, Cinna, and Sulla

For disagreements between famous and powerful men are wont to end
in nothing except either universal destruction or the tyrany or
rule of a victor.  Sulla, the noble and powerful consul, disagreed
with Marius, the illustrious citizen; each of them was thus
conquered and toppled, for the other to rule as victor.  Cinna
disagreed with his colleague Octavius; to each of them favorable
fortune granted a kingdom, and adverse fortune - death.  The same
Sulla was again victorious; then without doubt he had the power of
a king, even though he had restored the republic.

And indeed, Romans, keep all the civil dissensions in mind, not
just the ones that you heard about, but also those that you
yourselves paid attention to and considered.  L. Sulla overthrew
P. Sulpicius; he drove C. Marius, the city's guardian, out of the
city; he drove out many strong men and killed others.  The consul
Cn. Octavius drove his colleague from the city by force; this very
spot overflowed with piles of corpses and the blood of our fellow
citizens.  After that, Cinna had the upper hand with with Marius;
then truly, after the most illustrious men were killed, the lights
of the city were quenched.  And then Sulla avenged the barbarity
of that victory - there is no need either to say how great was the
loss to the citizens and how great a disaster to the republic.
Hard-harded L. Cinna, long-raging C. Marius, severe L. Sulla; and
what is crueler than their victory, was is more deadly?

 

 
Senecae de Sullae crudelitate sententia

C. L. Sullam tyrannum appellari quid prohibet, cui occidendi finem
fecit inopia hostium?  Descenderit licet e dictatura sua et se
togae reddiderit, quis tamen umquam tyrannus tam avide humanum
sanguinem bibit quam ille, qui septem milia civium Romanorum
contrucidari iussit?  Qui autem cum, in aede Bellonae sedens,
exaudisset conclamationem tot milium sub gladio gementium,
exterrito senatu: "Hoc agamus," inquit, "patres conscripti;
seditiosi pauculi meo iussu occiduntur." Hoc non est mentitus;
pauci Sullae videbantur.

Seneca's opinion on Sulla's cruelty

C. What keeps us from calling L. Sulla a tyrant, who only stopped
killing when he ran out of enemies?  Although he stepped down from
his dictatorship and returned to private life, yet what tyrant
ever so eagerly drank human blood as he, who ordered seven
thousand Roman citizens to be butchered?  But who, while sitting
in the temple of Bellona, clearly heard the screams of so many
thousands groaning under the sword, and when the senate was struck
with horror, said: "Let us do attend to business, senators; only a
few mutinous men are being killed, by my order."  This was not a
lie; it seemed like only a few men to Sulla.
