Bella Post Sullae mortem usque ad consulatum Crassi Pompeiique

Ante adventum in Italiam L. Sullae, Cn. Pompeius (eius
Cn. Pompeii filius, quem magnificentissimas res in consulatu
gessisse bello Italico praediximus), tres et viginti annos natus,
privatis ut opibus ita consiliis magna ausus magnificeque conata
exsecutus, ad vindicandam restituendamque dignitatem patriae
firmum ex agro Piceno, qui totus paternis eius clientelis
refertus erat, contraxit exercitum.

Post mortem Sullae, M. Aemilius Lepidus consul, cupidus rerum
novarum per insolentiam, acta Sullae rescindere parabat.  Proximo
anno, cum arma et exercitum contra urbem admoveret, a Quinto
Catulo Gnaeoque Pompeio retro pulsus est, hostisque a senatu
iudicatus, in Sardiniam recessit, ibique morbo et paenitentia
interiit.  Victores quoque, quod non temere alias in civilibus
bellis, pace contenti fuerunt.

Deinde Pompeius, Metello additus, in Sertorium missus est.  Quippe
Sertorius, vir summae quidem sed calamitosae virtutis, malis suis
maria terrasque permiscuit et tandem Hispaniam armavit.  Pompeius
Metellusque igitur Sertorium per totam Hispaniam persecuti sunt et
copias eius attriverunt.  Diu et ancipiti semper acie pugnatum est;
nec tamen Sertorius prius bello quam suorum scelere et insidiis
exstinctus est.  Nam M. Perpenna legatus Sertorium inter cenam
interemit Romanisque certam victoriam, partibus suis excidium, sibi
turpissimam mortem pessimo patravit facinore.  Metellus et Pompeius
externum id magis quam civile bellum videri voluerunt, ut
triumpharent.

Dum Sertorianum bellum in Hispania geritur, quattuor et sexaginta
fugitivi e ludo gladiatorio Capua profugientes, duce Spartaco,
primo Vesuvium montem petiere, mox, crescente in dies multitudine,
gravibus variisque casibus adfecere Italiam.  Belli huius patrati
gloria penes M. Crassum fuit, mox rei publicae omnium consensu
principem.

Tum Gnaeo Pompeio consulatus primus cum M. Crasso designatus est.
Eum magistratum Pompeius cum initurus foret, quoniam per militiae
tempora senatus habendi consulendique atque rerum expers urbanarum
fuit, M. Varronem, familiarem suum, rogavit uti commentarium
faceret, ex quo disceret quid facere dicereque deberet cum senatum
consuleret.


The wars after the death of Sulla up to the consulship of Crassus and Pompey

After the arrival in Italy of L. Sulla, Cn. Pompey (the son of
the Cn. Pompey, whose outstanding deeds in the consulship during
the Italian war we have already discussed) at twenty-three years
of age, with his own wealth and initiative, after venturing great
deeds and magnificantly executing what he attempted, in order to
vindicate and restore the dignity of the homeland, assembled an
army, which was completely provisioned with his father's clients,
and was reliable, due to its Picenian roots.

After Sulla's death, the consul M. Aemilius Lepidus, eager for
a new state of affairs in his insolence, was getting ready to annul
Sulla's acts.  The next year, when he advanced on the city with
an armed force, he was driven back by Quintus Catalus and Gnaeus
Pompey, and having been declared a public enemy by the senate,
retreated to Sardinia, and died there of illness and regret.
Even the victors were satisfied with the peace, not something
that doesn't happen often in civil wars.

Then Pompey was attached to Metellus and sent against Sertorius.
Indeed Sertorius, a man of the greatest but, indeed, ruinous
courage, embroiled seas and lands in his ills and armed Spain 
in the end.  Pompey and Metellus therefore pursued Sertorius
through all of Spain and wore his troops down.  For a long time the
conflict was continually waged on two fronts; and yet Sertorius was
killed, not in the war, but by the wickedness and treachery of his
own men.  For the legate M. Perpenna did away with Sertorius during
a dinner and accomplished, by this horrendous deed, a sure victory
for the Romans, the destruction of his own faction, and a most
disgraceful death for himself.  Metellus and Pompey wanted this to
appear as more a foreign than a civil war, so they could celebrate
a triumph.

While the Sertorian war was being waged in Spain, sixty four
fugitives, led by Spartacus, escaped from a gladiatorial school in
Capua.  First they made for Mt Vesuvius, then, with a mob growing
by the day, they afflicted Italy with diverse serious calamities.
When these wars were over, the glory belonged to M. Crassus, then,
by the consensus of all, the chief man of the republic.

Then Gnaeus Pompey was elected to his first consulship, along with
M. Crassus.  When Pompey was about to begin his magistracy, lacking
experience, due to his long term of military service, of holding
and advising senates, or of the affairs of the city, he asked his
good friend M. Varro to write a commentary, from which he might
learn what he ought to do and say when advising the senate.
