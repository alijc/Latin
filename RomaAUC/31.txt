Cicero fabulam de quaestura sua narrat

Ita multa Romae geruntur ut vix ea quae fiunt in provinciis audiantur.
Non vereor ne mihi aliquid, iudices, videar adrogare, si de quaestura
mea dixero.  Vere me hercule hoc dicam: sic tum existimabam, nihil
homines aliud Romae nisi de quaestura mea loqui.  Frumenti in summa
caritate maximum numerum miseram; negotiatoribus comis, mercatoribus
iustus, mancipibus liberalis, sociis abstinens; omnibus eram visus in
omni officio diligentissimus, excogitati quidam erant a Siculis
honores in me inauditi.  Itaque hac spe decedebam, ut mihi populum
Romanum ultro omnia delaturum putarem.

At ego, cum decedens e provincia Puteolos forte venissem diebus iis
cum plurimi et lautissimi um solent esse in iis locis, concidi paene,
iudices, cum ex me quidam quaesisset quo die Roma exissem et num
quidnam esset novi.  Cui cum respondissem me e provincia decedere,
"Etiam me hercule," inquit, "ut opinor, ex Africa."  Huic ego, iam
stomachans, fastidiose, "Immo, ex Sicila," inquam.  Tum quidam quasi
qui omnia sciret, "Quid? tu nescis," inquit, "hunc Syracusis
quaesturem fuisse?"  Quid multa?  Destiti stomachari, et me unum ex
iis feci, qui ad aquas venisset.

Sed ea res, iudices, haud scio an plus mihi profuerit, quam si
mihi tum essent omnes gratulati.  Nam destiti quid de me audituri
essent homines cogitare; feci ut postea cottidie me praesentem
viderent; habitavi in oculis; pressi forum; neminem a congressu
meo neque ianitor meus neque somnus absterruit.  Ecquid ego dicam
de occupatis meis temporibus, cui fuerit ne otium quidem umquam
otiosum?  Nam quas tu commemoras, Cassi, legere te colere
orationes cum otiosus sis, has ego scripsi ludis et feriis, ne
omnino umquam essem otiosus.18 Itaque si quam habeo laudem (quae
quanta sit, nescio), parta Romae est, quaesita in foro, meaque
privata consilia publici quoque casus comprobaverunt, ut etiam
summa res publica mihi domi fuerit gerenda, et urbs in urbe
servanda.
 

Cicero tells a story about his quaestorship

So many things happen in Rome that they hardly hear tell of what
happens in the provinces.  I have no fear that I might seem to claim
aught for myself, jurors, if I speak about my quaestorship.  Truly, by
Hercules, I'll say this: I then thought thus, that men in Rome spoke
of nothing other than my quaestorship.  I had sent a huge amount of
grain in a time of high prices; I was courteous to traders, fair to
merchants, generous to agents, restrained to allies; in every duty I
seemed to all to be the most diligent, and certain unheard of honors
had been invented by Sicilians about me.  And so I left office in the
hope that the Roman people were going to grant me everything else besides.

But in leaving the province I had by chance come to Puteli during the
days when very many fashionable people were wont to be there.  I
nearly fell over, jurors, after some man asked me when I'd left Rome
and if there was any news.  And when I answered him that I was
returning from a province, he said, "Indeed, by Hercules, as I
suppose, from Africa."  And already boiling with rage, I disdainfully
told him, "On the contrary, from Sicily."  Then some know-it-all
said, "What? Don't you know that this man was quaestor in Syracuse?"
In short?  I stopped being angry, and turned myself into one of those
who had come for the waters.

But the thing is, jurors, I'm inclined to think that I was better
off than if everyone had thanked me then.  For I left off
thinking about what men might have heard about me; I saw
to it that after that I daily put myself in their view.  I lived
in the public eye; I pressed the flesh at the market-place;
neither my doorkeeper or sleep ever kept anyone from meeting me.
Whatever could I say about my busy spells, since I never had,
indeed, any leisure or spare time?  For the speeches that you keep
in mind, Cassius, to read and cherish when you are idle, I wrote
them at games and festivals, to keep myself from ever being idle.
And so if whatever praise I have (I don't know how great it might
be), was born of Rome, sought out in the Forum, and also,
public fortunes justified my personal plans, even so, the general
welfare had to have been managed for me at home, and the city
preserved in the city.
