A. Catonis stoici mores

Finxit enim te ipsa natura ad honestatem, gravitatem, temperantiam
magnitudinem animi, iustitiam — ad omnes denique virtutes —— magnum
hominem et excelsum.  Accessit istuc doctrina non moderata nec
mitis, sed (ut mihi videtur) paulo asperior et durior quam aut
veritas aut natura patitur.  Magister enim doctrinae tuae fuit
quidam summo ingenio vir, Zeno, cuius inventorum aemuli Stoici
nominantur.  Huius sententiae sunt et praecepta eius modi: sapientem
gratia numquam moveri; numquam cuiusquam delicto ignoscere; neminem
misericordem esse nisi stultum et levem.  Haec homo ingeniosissimus,
M. Cato, auctoribus eruditissimis inductus, adripuit, neque
disputandi causa, ut magna pars, sed ita vivendi.  Moderatiores ad
magistros si qua te fortuna, Cato, cum ista natura detulisset, non
tu quidem vir melior esses nec fortior nec temperantior nec iustior
— neque enim esse potes — sed paulo ad lenitatem propensior.  Ac te
ipsum (quantum ego opinione auguror) nunc et animi quodam impetu
concitatum et vi naturae atque ingeni elatum et recentibus
praeceptorum studiis flagrantem, iam usus flectet, dies leniet,
aetas mitigabit.


Cato's stoic morals

For nature itself shaped you for integrity, dignity, moderation,
greatness of mind, justice -- in short, to all virtues -- a great
and noble man.  To these was added a doctrine that is neither
restrained nor gentle, but (as it seems to me) a little ruder and
harsher than either truth or nature allows.  For the teacher of your
doctrine was a certain man of the height of character, Zeno, the
followers of whose doctrines are called Stoics.  His opinions are
also teachings of his sort: that a wise man is never stirred by
goodwill; that he never forgives anyone's offense; that no-one is
merciful unless he's foolish and fickle.  Α very clever man,
M. Cato, influenced by the most erudite authors, took hold of these
doctrines, and not, as with most people, for the sake of discussion,
but for living thus.  Indeed, Cato, with your character, had any
fortune brought you to more restrained teachers, 
you'd not be a better man, nor a stronger or more self-controlled or
more fair one -- for you cannot be such -- just a little readier to
lenience.  But you yourself (if I may venture a prophesy), now both
disturbed by a sort of assault of the heart and exalted by the
strength of your nature and character and burning with your latest
zeal of precepts, will soon be softened by experience, calmed by
time, soothed by age.


B. Caesaris cum Catone comparatio

Memoria mea ingenti virtute, diversis moribus fuere viri duo:
M. Cato et C. Caesar.  Igitur eis genus, aetas, eloquentia prope
aequalia fuere, magnitudo animi par, item gloria, sed alia alii.
Caesar beneficiis ac munificentia magnus habebatur, integritate
vitae Cato.  Ille mansuetudine et misericordia clarus factus,
huic severitas dignitatem addiderat.  Caesar dando,
sublevando. ignoscendo, Cato nihil largiendo gloriam adeptus est.
In altero miseris perfugium erat, in altero malis pernicies.
Illius facilitas, huius constantia laudabatur.  Postremo Caesar
in animum induxerat laborare, vigilare, negotiis amicorum
intentus sua neglegere, nihil denegare quod dono dignum esset.
Sibi magnum imperium, exercitum, bellum novum exoptabat, ubi
virtus enitescere posset.  At Catoni studium modestiae, decoris,
sed maxime severitatis erat.  Non divitiis cum divite, neque
factione cum factione sed cum strenuo virtute, cum modesto
pudore, cum innocente abstinentia certabat; esse quam videri
bonus malebat.  Ita, quo minus petebat gloriam, eo magis illum
adsequebatur.


A comparison of Caesar with Cato

According to my recollection, the two men, M. Cato and C. Caesar,
both had remarkabe virtue, but differed in character.  And so
their birth, age, and eloquence were nearly the same, the
magnitude of their intellects equal, likewise their fame, but to
different extents.  Caesar was held to be great in favors and
munificence, Cato in the integrity of his life.  The former was
made famous through his clemency and compassion, while the latter
increased his dignity though his severity.  Caesar gained glory
by giving, assisting, and pardoning, and Cato by never giving
lavishly.  In one was a refuge for the poor, in the other, a ruin
for evil-doers.  The former's good nature and the latter's
steadfastness were commended.  In the end Caesar had taken it to
heart to labor and to watch, ready to neglect his own business
for the troubles of his friends, to deny nothing that might be
suitable as a gift.  He longed for great authority for himself,
an army, or a new war, where his courage could stand out.  But
Cato's zeal was for restraint and decorum, but especially
severity.  He vied, not for wealth with a rich man, nor for
partisanship with a faction, but with strenuous virtue, with
restrained modesty, with upright temperance; he prefered being
good over seeming so.  So, the less he desired fame, the more it
followed him.
