Exitus Pompeii Catonisque

Ciceroni vero in castris Pompeianis nihil boni praeter causam
visum est; extra ducem enim paucosque praeterea de principibus,
reliqui et in ipso bello rapaces erant, et in oratione ita
crudeles, ut ipsam victoriam horreret.  Quae cum vidisset,
desperans victoriam, primum coepit suadere pacem, cuius fuerat
semper auctor; deinde, cum ab ea sententia Pompeius valde
abhorreret, suadere instituit ut bellum duceret.  Hoc interdum
probabat et in ea sententia mansisset fortasse, nisi quadam ex
pugna coepisset suis militibus confidere.  Ex eo tempore, vir ille
summus nullus imperator fuit.  Signa tirone et collecticio
exercitu cum legionibus robustissimis contulit; victus turpissime,
amissis etiam castris, solus fugit.

Aegyptum autem petere proposuit, memor beneficiorum quae in patrem
eius Ptolemaei, qui tum puer regnabat Alexandriae, contulerat.
Sed quis in adversis beneficiorum servat memoriam?  Aut quis ullam
calamitosis deberi putat gratiam?  Aut quando fortuna non mutat
fidem?  Consilio itaque Theodoti et Achillae, missi sunt ab rege
qui Pompeium venientem exciperent hortarenturque ut ex oneraria
nave in eam quae obviam processerat transcenderet.  Quod cum
fecisset, princeps Romani nominis imperio arbitrioque Aegyptii
mancipii iugulatus est.  Hic, post tres consulatus et totidem
triumphos domitumque terrum orbem, sanctissimi atque
praestantissimi viri, duodesexagesimum annum agentis, pridie
natalem ipsius vitae, fuit exitus.  Sed certe de Pompeii morte
nemini dubium umquam fuit.  Tanta enim desperatio rerum eius
omnium regum et populorum animos occuparat, ut, quocumque
venisset, hoc futurum esset.

Pompeio mortuo, reliqui optimates a Caesare Thapsi victi sunt,
Cato vero non interfuit proelio, quod Uticam servabat; sed,
accepta partium clade, nihil cunctatus, ut sapiente dignum erat,
mortem sibi etiam laetus accivit.  Nam postquam filium
comitesque ab amplexu dimisit, in noctem lecto ad lucernam
Platonis libro qui immortalitatem animae docet, paulum se quieti
dedit.  Tunc circa primam vigiliam, stricto gladio, pectus semel
iterumque percussit.  Ille autem, virtutum viva imago, incumbens
gladio, simul de se actum esse ac de re publica palam fecit.


The death of Pompey and Cato

Indeed, to Cicero there seemed to be nothing good in Pompey's camp
save the cause; other than the general and a few other chief
optimates, the rest had had been both rapacious in the war itself
and so cruel in their speech that he actually dreaded a victory.
After he saw this, despairing of victory, he first began to urge
peace, which he had always proposed; then, when Pompey was highly
averse to this way of thinking, he commenced to urge him to
prolong the war.  At times he assented to this and and might
perhaps have retained the way of thinking, had he not, as a result
of a certain battle, gained confidence in his soldiers.  From that
time, this greatest of men was no longer a commander.  He joined
battle, with a novice and hastily gathered army, against powerful
legions; disgracefully defeated, losing even his camp, he fled
alone.

Then he proposed to make for Egypt, remembering the services that
he had conferred upon the father of Ptolemy, who was a child at
the time, ruling in Alexandria.  But who holds on to the memory of
services in misfortunes?  Or who thinks that any gratitude is owed
to ruined men?  Or when does fortune not alter loyalty?  And so by
the advice of Theodotius and Achilles, the king sent men to
receive the arriving Pompey and urge him to climb out of the cargo
ship into one had come to meet him.  And after he did this, a
Roman prince had his throat cut, by the command and authority of
an Egyptian slave.  This was the end of a most august and
outstanding man, on the day before his fifty-ninth birthday, after
three consulships and as many triumphs and the conquest of the
world.  But certainly no-one ever had a doubt about the death of
Pompey.  For his affairs were in such desperate straits and had
seized the minds of kings and of people, that wherever he might
have gone, this was going to happen.

After Pompey's death, the rest of the optimates were defeated by
Caesar at Thapsus.  In truth, Cato wasn't present at the battle
because he was guarding Utica; but, when he received news of his
faction's ruin, without hesitation, as was fitting for a
philosopher, he cheerfully committed suicide.  For after he
released his son and comrades from his embrace, and read far
into the night by lamplight from a book by Plato, who taught the
immortality of the soul, he allowed himself a bit of repose.
Then, around the first watch, he drew a sword and pierced his
breast once and then again.  But he, the living image of virtue,
falling on his sword, made it clear that all was lost for both
him and for the republic.
