Pugna Philippica

Caesar Octavianus nihil convenientius duxit quam necem avunculi
vindicare tuerique acta.  Itaque lege Pedia, quam consul Pedius
collega eius tulerat, omnibus qui Caesarem patrem interfecerant aqua
ignique interdictum erat.  Cum igitur Cassius et Brutus in
Macedoniam ab Asia exercitus traiecissent, Caesar quoque et Antonius
in Macedoniam profecti sunt et apud urbem Philippos cum Bruto
Cassioque acie concurrerunt.  Primo pugnae die cornu cui Brutus
praeerat, repulsis hostibus, castra Caesaris cepit; id autem in quo
Cassius fuerat fugatum ac male mulcatum in altiora se receperat
loca.

Tum Cassius, ex sua fortuna eventum collegae aestimans, dimisit
evocatum iussitque nuntiare sibi quae esset multitudo hominum quae
ad se tenderet.  Tardius eo nuntiante, cum in vicino esset agmen
cursu ad eum tendentium, neque pulvere aut facies aut signa
denotari possent, existimans hostes esse qui inruerent, lacerna
caput circum dedit extentamque cervicem interritus liberto
praebuit.  Deciderat Cassii caput, cum evocatus advenit nuntians
Brutum esse victorem.  Qui cum imperatorem prostratum videret,
"Sequar," inquit, "eum quem mea occidit tarditas," et ita in
gladium incubuit.

Post paucos deinde dies Brutus iterum conflixit cum hostibus et,
victus acie, cum in tumulum nocte ex fuga se recepisset, impetravit
a Stratone, familiari suo, ut manum morituro commodaret sibi
impellensque se in mucronem gladii eius, uno ictu transfixus,
expiravit protinus.  Hunc exitum M. Bruti septimum et tricesimum
annum agentis Fortuna esse voluit, incorrupto animo eius in diem
quae illi omnes virtutes unius temeritate facti abstulit.  Fuit
autem dux Cassius melior quanto vir Brutus; e quibus Brutum amicum
habere malles, inimicum magis timeres Cassium; in altero maior vis,
in altero virtus.  Qui si vicissent, quantum rei publicae interfuit
Caesarem Octavianum potius habere quam Antonium principem, tantum
retulisset habere Brutum quam Cassium.  Fractis Bruti Cassiique
partibus, Antonius, transmarinas obiturus provincias, ad Orientem
ordinandum substitit.  Caesar autem in Italiam ad veteranos
municipalibus agris collocandos regressus est.  Nec successum
victoriae moderatus est, sed, capite Bruti Romam misso ut statuae
Caesaris subiceretur, in alios splendidissimos captivos non sine
verborum contumelia saeviit.


The Battle of Philippi

Caesar Octavianus thought nothing was more agreeable than to avenge his
uncle's murder and to uphold his deeds.  And so by the Pedian law,
which the consul Pedius enacted with his colleague, all who killed
his father Caesar were forbidden water and fire.  Therefore,
when Cassius and Brutus had transported their armies from Asia to
Macedonia, Caesar and Antony also departed for Macedonia and engaged
in battle with Brutus and Cassius near the city of Phillipi.  On the
first day Brutus took the lead of the battle from his wing, and
after repulsing the enemy, captured Caesar's camp; but the wing that
Cassius was in was badly thrashed and put to flight and retreated to
higher ground.

Then Cassius, assessing his colleague's fate from his own fortune,
sent a long-time veteran out, ordering him to report back to him who
the great multitude of men marching towards him were.  But the
report was long in coming, and there was a column near at hand
marching toward him on the double, which couldn't be made out
through the dust by either their appearance or their standards.
Judging them to be the enemy attacking, he wrapped his head round with
his cloak and fearlessly offered his neck to a freedman.  He'd just
cut off Cassius' head, when the veteran arrived to report that
Brutus was the victor.  And when he saw the general struck down, he
said, "I'll follow him whom my tardiness killed", and so fell on his
sword.

Then, after a few days, Brutus once more fought with the enemy and
was defeated in battle. He retreated to a hill in the night in his
flight and asked Strato, his servant, to lend him a hand in his
death and, driving himself onto the point of his sword, was pierced
in a single stroke and died at once.  Fortune willed this to be the
end of M. Brutus, after reaching his thirty-seventh year with his
spirit uncorrupted, until that day in which he swept all his
virtues away in a single rash act.  But Cassius was the better
general, as much as Brutus was the better man; and between them,
you'd rather have Brutus for a friend, and dread to have Cassius as
an enemy; in the first was great strength, in the second was
virtue.  But if any men had succeeded, it would have been as much
better for the republic have Brutus over Cassius for a leader, as
to have Caesar Octavianus rather than Antony.  With Brutus' and
Cassius' factions crushed, Antony, since he was about to go
overseas, started making arrangements to head East.  But Caesar
returned to Italy, to settle the veterans on municipal fields.  And
he didn't guide the outcome of the victory, but, with the head of
Brutus having been sent to Rome to be placed at the feet of the
statue of Caesar, he raged against the other splendid prisoners,
not without words of abuse.
