Septem montes urbis Romae

Haec sunt nomina septem montium urbis Romae: Capitolinus (vel
Tarpeius), Esquilinus, Palatinus, Caelius, Aventinus, Quirinalis,
Viminalis.  Capitolinus mons ita appellatus est quod Romulus ibi
Capitolium constituit, vel Tarpeius quod ibi Tarpeia virgo obruta
est clipeis Sabinorum.  Esquilinus mons duos colles habet, Oppium
Cispiumque.  In Palatino monte sepultus est Pallas, filius
Evandri qui ab Arcadia Romam migratus est.  Caelius mons a Caele
quodam dictus est qui Romulo auxilium ex Etruria adversus Sabinos
praebuit.  Aventinus mons nomen habet ex rege Albanorum Aventino,
qui, bello extinctus, ibi sepultus est.  Quirinalis mons a templo
Quirini, id est Romuli, appellatus est, sive quod ibi Quirites,
id est Sabini, habitabant.  Viminalis mons autem ita dictus est a
silva viminum.  Duo alii montes trans Tiberim iacent, Ianiculus
et Vaticanus.  In Ianiculo monte Ianus deus aedem aut lucum olim
habuit.  Vaticanus mons ita appellari dicitur quod, expulsis
Etruscis, Romanus populus eo vatum responso potitus sit.


The seven hills of the city of Rome

These are the names of the seven hills of the city of Rome: the
Capitoline (or Tarpeian), Esquiline, Palatine, Caelius, Aventine,
Quirininal, and Viminal.  The Capitoline hill was so named
because Romulus built the Capitol there, or the Tarpeian, because
the maiden Tarpeia was crushed there under the Sabines' shields.
The Esquiline hill has two summits, Oppius and Cispius.  Pallas,
the son of Evander who was carried from Arcadia to Rome, was
buried on the Palatine hill.  The Caelius hill was named for a
certain Caelus, someone from Etruria who provided Romulus with
aid against the Sabines.  The Aventine hill has its name from
King Aventinus of the Albans, who was buried there after the war
was over.  The Quirininal hill was named after the temple of
Quirinus, that is, Romulus, or because the Quirites, that is, the
Sabines, lived there.  And the Viminal hill is so named from its
willow forest.  Two other hills lie on the other side of the
Tiber, the Janiculan and the Vatican.  The god Janus used to have
a temple or a sacred grove on the Janiculan hill.  The Vatican
hill is so named because, after the Etruscans were driven out,
the Roman people may have gotten possession of it through a
response of the seers (the vates).
