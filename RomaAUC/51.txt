Romulus, augurio victor, Romam condit

Iam luerat poenas frater Numitoris, et omne
 pastorum gemino sub duce vulgus erat.
Contrahere agrestes et moenia ponere utrique
 convenit; ambigitur, moenia ponat uter.
"Nil opus est" dixit "certamine" Romulus "ullo.
 Magna fides avium est; experiamur aves."
Res placet. Alter adit nemorosi saxa Palati;
 alter Aventinum mane cacumen init.
Sex Remus, hic volucres bis sex videt ordine. Pacto
 statur, et arbitrium Romulus urbis habet.
Apta dies legitur qua moenia signet aratro.
 Sacra Palis suberant. Inde movetur opus.
Fossa fit ad solidum; fruges iaciuntur in ima
 et de vicino terra petita solo.
Fossa repletur humo, plenaeque imponitur ara,
 et novus accenso fungitur igne focus.
Inde premens stivam designat moenia sulco;
 alba iugum niveo cum bove vacca tulit.


Romulus, victorious by divination, founds Rome

Numitor's brother had already paid the price, and the whole
 mob of shepherds was under the leadership of the twins.
Uniting the peasants and erecting walls was agreeable
  to both; but which one would erect the walls was in dispute.
"There's no need", said Romulus, "for any dispute.
 The reliability of birds is great: let's put birds to the test."
The matter was agreed. One visited the stones of the well-wooded Palatine;
 the other went to the Aventine summit in the morning.
Remus saw six birds, the other twice six in a row. They abide
 by the agreement, and Romulus has the mastery of the city.
An auspicious day is picked, on which he might mark the walls with a plow.
 The sacred rites of Pales had drawn near.  Then the work was set in motion.
A ditch was dug down to bedrock.  Crops were thrown in the deepest
 desired land and from the nearby soil.
The ditch was filled in again with dirt, and, full, an altar was set up on it,
 and a new hearth was administered with kindled flame.
Then, bearing down on the plow handle, he marked the walls with a furrow;
 he brought a yoke with a white cow and snow-white bull.
