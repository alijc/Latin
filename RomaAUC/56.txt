Alter consul tandem de plebe creatus

Refecti decumum tribuni, Sextius et Licinius de decemviris sacrorum
ex parte de plebe creandis legem pertulere.  Creatis quinque
patrum, quinque plebis, gradu eo iam via facta ad consulatum
videbatur.  Hac igitur victoria contenta, plebs cessit patribus ut,
in praesentia consulum mentione omissa, tribuni militum consulari
cum potestate rursus crearentur.

Eodem anno fama repens belli Gallici perpulit civitatem ut Marcus
Furius dictator quintum diceretur.  Signis cum Gallis conlatis, nec
dubia nec difficilis Romanis, quamquam ingentem Galli terrorem
memoria pristinae cladis attulerant, victoria fuit.  Sed vixdum
perfunctum Furium bello atrocior domi seditio excepit.  Et per
ingentia certamina dictator senatusque victi sunt, ut rogationes
tribuniciae acciperentur.  Cum igitur comitia consulum adversa
nobilitate habita essent, Lucius Sextius primus de plebe consul
factus est.  Sed ne is quidem finis certaminum fuit.  Quia patricii
se auctores futuros esse negabant, prope secessionem plebis res
veniebat, cum tandem, condicionibus a dictatore propositis, sedatae
discordiae sunt.  Concessum est ab nobilitate plebi de consule
plebeio; a plebe nobilitati de praetore, qui ius in urbe diceret,
ex patribus creando.  Ita ab diutina ira tandem in concordiam
redactis ordinibus, dignam eam rem senatus censuit esse ut gratiae
deis immortalibus merito agerentur.


Another of the common people finally made consul

After Sextius and Licinius were restored as tribunes for the tenth
time, they enacted a law for the creation of a board for sacred
rites, partly from the common people.  Five patricians and five
commoners were appointed to it, and by this step it seemed that a
path was now created to the consulship.  And so, with this victory
secured, the common people submitted to the patricians so that,
with the present naming of consuls having been passed over,
military tribunes were once again created with consular power.

In the same year the sudden news of a Gallic war compelled the city
to appoint Marcus Furius as dictator, for the fifth time.  In the
clash with the Gauls, victory was neither doubtful nor difficult
for the Romans, although the Gauls produced great fear, due to the
memory of a former defeat.  But Furius had barely been discharged
from the war when a more savage rebellion at home drew him back.
And in a momentous battle the dictator and the senate were
defeated, so that the proposed tribunical measures could be passed.
And so when the election of consuls was held, with the nobility in
opposition, Lucius Sextius was the first commoner created consul.
But not even this put an end to the combat.  For the patricians
refused to confirm him and the matter was approaching a rebellion
of the commoners, until, at last, when conditions were proposed by
the dictator, the discords were allayed.  The matter of a plebeian
consul was conceded by the nobility to the commoners; And the
commoners conceded to the nobility that the praetor, who pronounced
the law in the city, should be appointed from the patricians.
Thus, once the classes had finally been driven from long-lasting
resentment to mutual agreement, the senate judged that the matter
was deserving of thanks to be given to the immortal gods.
