Appii Claudii Caeci mores

Memoriae felicis ad posteros nomen Appi quod viam munivit et
aquam in urbem duxit.  Eaque unus perfecit, quia, ob infamem
atque invidiosam senatus lectionem verecundia victus, collega
Gaius Plautius magistratu se abdicaverat.  Appius iam inde
antiquitus insitam pertinaciam familiae, gerendo solus censuram,
obtinuit.  Ad Appi Claudi senectutem accedebat etiam, ut caecus
esset; tamen is, cum sententia senatus inclinaret ad pacem cum
Pyrrho foedusque faciendum, non dubitavit dicere illa quae
versibus persecutus est Ennius:

      Quo vobis mentes, rectae quae stare solebant antehac,
      dementes sese flexere viai?

Ceteraque gravissime; notum enim vobis carmen est; et tamen ipsius
Appi exstat oratio.  Atque haec ille egit septimo decimo anno post
alterum consulatum, cum inter duos consulatus anni decem
interfuissent censorque ante superiorem consulatum fuisset.  Ex
quo intellegitur Pyrrhi bello eum grandem sane fuisse; et tamen
sic a patribus accepimus.  Quattuor robustos filios, quinque
filias, tantam domum, tantas clientelas Appius regebat et caecus
et senex.  Intentum enim animum tamquam arcum habebat, nec
languescens succumbebat senectuti.  Tenebat non modo auctoritatem,
sed etiam imperium in suos; metuebant servi, verebantur liberi,
carum omnes habebant.  Vigebat enim in illa domo mos patrius et
disciplina.


The character of Appius Claudius the Blind

The name of Appius is of happy memory to posterity because he
brought a road and water into the city.  And he accomplished
them by himself because, on account of the notorious and odious
selection of the senate, Gaius Plautius, his colleague, overcome
with shame, resigned his office.  Appius had long since of old
held the persistance innate to his family, by carrying the
office of the censor alone.  Towards the and of Appius Claudius'
life was also added the fact that that he was blind; yet still,
when the opinion of the senate leaned towards making a treaty
and a peace with Pyrrhus, he did not hesitate to say what Ennius
sought to attain in these lines:

   Where do your minds, that were wont to stand upright til now,
   recklessly turn to?

And it went on very gravely; for the poem is known to you; and the
speech of Appius himself is still on record.  And he did these
things in the seventeenth year after his second consulship, after
ten years had come between the two consulships and he had been
censor before his most recent consulship.  And from this it was
understood that he'd been old indeed by Pyrrhus' war: and yet we
were so told by our forefathers.  Four hearty sons, five
daughters, a great house, many clients, these Appius managed while
both blind and old.  For he had an attentive mind like a bent bow,
and did not sink, wilting, into old age.  He held not only
influence, but also power over his household; his slaves feared
him, his children respected him, everyone held him dear.  For
ancestral habit and training was strong in that house.
