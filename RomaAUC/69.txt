Venus omnium animantium genetrix

Aeneadum genetrix, hominum divomque voluptas,
alma Venus, caeli subter labentia signa
quae mare navigerum, quae terras frugiferentis
concelebras, per te quoniam genus omne animantum
concipitur visitque exortum lumina solis-
te, dea, te fugiunt venti, te nubila caeli
adventumque tuum; tibi suavis daedala tellus
submittit flores, tibi rident aequora ponti,
placatumque nitet diffuso lumine caelum.
Nam simul ac species patefactast verna diei
et reserata viget genitabilis aura Favoni,
aeriae primum volucres te, diva, tuumque
significant initum perculsae corda tua vi.
Inde ferae, pecudes persultant pabula laeta
et rapidos tranant amnis; ita capta lepore
te sequitur cupide quo quamque inducere pergis.
Denique per maria ac montis fluviosque rapacis 
frondiferasque domos avium camposque virentis
omnibus incutiens blandum per pectora amorem,
efficis ut cupide generatim saecla propagent.
Quae quoniam rerum naturam sola gubernas, 
nec sine te quicquam dias in luminis oras
exoritur, neque fit laetum neque amabile quicquam, 
te sociam studeo scribendis versibus esse 
quos ego de rerum natura pangere conor
Memmiadae nostro, quem tu, dea, tempore in omni
omnibus ornatum voluisti excellere rebus.
Quo magis aeternum da dictis, diva, leporem.
Effice ut interea fera moenera militiai
per maria ac terras omnis sopita quiescant.
Nam tu sola potes tranquilla pace iuvare
mortalis, quoniam belli fera moenera Mavors
armipotens regit, in gremium qui saepe tuum se
reicit, aeterno devictus vulnere amoris.
Hunc tu, diva, tuo recubantem corpore sancto
circumfusa super, suavis ex ore loquellas
funde, petens placidam Romanis, incluta, pacem.
Nam neque nos agere hoc patriai tempore iniquo
possumus aequo animo, nec Memmi clara propago
talibus in rebus communi desse saluti. 

Venus the mother of all living things

Mother of Aeneas' race, the delight of men and gods,
Nourishing Venus, who celebrates the ship-bearing sea,
the fertile lands, beneath the gliding signs of heaven,
for every sort of living thing is conceived through you,
springs up and gazes at the light of the sun -
you, goddess, from you the winds fly, and the clouds of the sky
flee your coming; for you the pleasant earth puts forth
variegated blossoms, for you the surface of the sea smiles,
and shines upon the placated sky with a spreading light.
For as soon as the appearance of springtide is revealed
and the West Wind's breeze is released and strengthens.
First the flying birds announce your coming, goddess, 
smitten to their core by your power.
Then wild beasts prance upon the joyful meadows
and swim swift rivers; so seized by charm
any being that you lead follows you with zeal.
Finally, across mountains, seas and raging rivers
and the leafy homes of birds and verdant plains,
instilling a coaxing love in every breast,
you zealously cause each species to increase.
And since it's you alone who directs the nature of things,
and without you nothing comes forth onto the divine shores of light,
nor does anything cheerful nor loving happen,
I wish you to be my partner in writing the verses
that I'm trying to compose about the nature of things
for my friend Memmius, whom you, goddess, have wished to excel,
honored in all things and in every season.
And therefore, goddess, give eternal charm to my words.
Meanwhile, make the fierce duties of war of each man
slumber quietly over seas and lands.
For you alone can aid mortal men with a tranquil peace,
since Mars, strong in arms, who rules over the fierce duties of war,
often flings himself into your bosom,
forever conquered by the wound of love.
As you bend your divine body over his reclining form,
pour out speeches from your honeyed lips,
begging, illustrious goddess, a gentle peace for the Romans.
For I cannot, with a just mind, manage here in a dangerous time
for our native land, nor can Memmius' shining offspring
to be wanting in such things for the public weal.
