B.
Nulli se dicit mulier mea nubere malle
 quam mihi, non si se Iuppiter ipse petat.
Dicit —sed mulier cupido quod dicit amanti
 in vento et rapida scribere oportet aqua.

My woman says that she wishes to marry no-one
 but me, not if Jupiter himself were to desire it
So she says - but what a woman says to her eager lover
 ought to be written in wind and swift water.


C.
Odi et amo—quare id faciam, fortasse requiris —
 Nescio—sed fieri sentio et excrucior.

I hate and I love - how could I do this, you may well ask.
 I don't know - but I feel it is so and I am in torment.


D.
Dicebas quondam solum te nosse Catullum,
 Lesbia, nec prae me velle tenere Iovem.
Dilexi tum te non tantum ut vulgus amicam,
 sed pater ut gnatos diligit et generos.
Nunc te cognovi; quare etsi impensius uror,
 multo mi tamen es vilior et levior.
"Qui potis est?" inquis?  Quod amantem iniuria talis
cogit amare magis, sed bene velle minus.

You used to say that you knew Catullus alone,
 Lesbia, and wouldn't hold Jove before me.
I loved you then not so much as the rabble does a mistress,
 but as a father loves his children and their spouses.
Now I know you; how even though I burn so hot,
 yet to me you are so much more common and trifling.
"How is this possible", you say?  Because such an injury
 forces the lover to love you more, but to wish you well less.


E.
Miser Catulle, desinas ineptire;
et quod vides perisse, perditum ducas.
Fulsere quondam candidi tibi soles,
cum ventitabas quo puella ducebat
amata nobis quantum amabitur nulla.
Ibi illa multa cum iocosa fiebant,
quae tu volebas nec puella nolebat,
fulsere vere candidi tibi soles.
Nunc iam illa non vult. Tu quoque impotens noli;
nec quae fugit sectare; nec miser vive;
sed obstinata mente perfer, obdura.
Vale, puella. Iam Catullus obdurat;
nec te requiret nec rogabit invitam.
At tu dolebis, cum rogaberis nulla.
Scelesta, vae te—quae tibi manet vita?
Quis nunc te adibit? Cui videberis bella?
Quem nunc amabis? Cuius esse diceris?
Quem basiabis? Cui labella mordebis?
At tu, Catulle, destinatus obdura.

Catullus, you wretch, leave off playing the fool;
and consider as lost what you have seen is gone.
Bright suns once shone for you,
when you often went where the lass led
as dear to us as she'll not be loved again.
Then when those many jests happened,
which you wanted and the lass did not refuse,
truly, bright suns shone for you.
But now she's no longer willing.  And you are weak, refuse her;
don't pursue one who flees, or live unhappy;
but bear it with a firm mind, be hard.
Farewell, lass. Already Catullus is hard;
he'll neither seek you out nor court you unbidden.
But you will grieve, when you are courted by none.
Woe to you, wicked woman - what sort of life is left for you?
Who will visit you now? Who will think you fair?
Who will you love now? Whose will you be said to be?
Who will you kiss?  Whose lips will you bite?
But you, Catullus, be hard and resolute.
