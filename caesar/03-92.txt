92.1
Inter duas acies tantum erat relictum spatii,
ut satis esset ad concursum utriusque exercitus.

Sed Pompeius suis praedixerat,
ut Caesaris impetum exciperent neve se loco moverent aciemque eius distrahi paterentur;
idque admonitu C. Triarii fecisse dicebatur,
ut primus incursus visque militum infringeretur aciesque distenderetur,
atque in suis ordinibus dispositi dispersos adorirentur;
leviusque casura pila sperabat in loco retentis militibus,
quam si ipsi immissis telis occurrissent, simul fore,
ut duplicato cursu Caesaris milites exanimarentur et lassitudine conficerentur.

Quod nobis quidem nulla ratione factum a Pompeio videtur,
propterea quod est quaedam animi incitatio atque alacritas naturaliter innata omnibus,
quae studio pugnae incenditur;
hanc non reprimere, sed augere imperatores debent;
neque frustra antiquitus institutum est,
ut signa undique concinerent clamoremque universi tollerent;
quibus rebus et hostes terreri et suos incitari existimaverunt.

Between the two lines there was so much space remaining
that there was enough for each army to charge.
But Pompey had ordered his men to receive Caesar's charge and
not to stir from the spot or allow themselves to be separated;
and on the recommendation of C. Triarius he was said to have supposed that the
first assault and the force of the soldiers would be weakened and spread out,
and the stationary men in his ranks would attack the scattered ones;
and he hoped that the spears would topple more lightly in place
to/by soldiers who'd been held back,
than if they themselves had resisted with javelins cast in,
like/at the same time to be going to be,
so that, with Caesar's line of advance bent double, the soldiers might be
tired and finished off through exhaustion.
Indeed, that seems to us to have been done by Pompey for no reason,
because there is a certain enthusiasm of the heart and eagerness inborn naturally to all men,
which zeal for battle is kindled;
generals ought, not to repress this, but to increase it;
and not for nought was it established in olden times,
that trumpet calls should sound together from every side and all men raise the
battle-cry;
with which they believed both that the enemy would be frightened and our own men urged on .
