Book I section [10] 

Acceptis mandatis Roscius cum L. Caesare Capuam pervenit ibique consules
Pompeiumque invenit; postulata Caesaris renuntiat. Illi deliberata re respondent
scriptaque ad eum mandata per eos remittunt; quorum haec erat summa: Caesar in
Galliam reverteretur, Arimino excederet, exercitus dimitteret; quae si fecisset,
Pompeium in Hispanias iturum. Interea, quoad fides esset data Caesarem facturum,
quae polliceretur, non intermissuros consules Pompeiumque delectus.

Roscius, having accepted the commission, reaches Capua along with L. Caesar,
and finds the consuls and Pompey there.  He reports Caesar's demands.
They, having deliberated on the matter, reply and return via these men
written orders for Caesar; of which the foremost are; let Caesar return to
Gaul, retire from Ariminum, disband his army; if these things were done,
Pompey would march into Spain.  In the meantime, until Caesar should offer 
assurances for the things that he had promised, the levies would not be
interrupted by the consuls or by Pompey.
