Adventu Caesaris cognito decuriones Auximi ad Attium Varum frequentes
conveniunt; docent sui iudicii rem non esse; neque se neque reliquos
municipes pati posse C. Caesarem imperatorem, bene de re publica
meritum, tantis rebus gestis oppido moenibusque prohiberi; proinde
habeat rationem posteritatis et periculi sui. Quorum oratione
permotus Varus praesidium, quod introduxerat, ex oppido educit ac
profugit. Hunc ex primo ordine pauci Caesaris consecuti milites
consistere coegerunt. Commisso proelio deseritur a suis Varus;
nonnulla pars militum domum discedit; reliqui ad Caesarem perveniunt,
atque una cum eis deprensus L. Pupius, primi pili centurio,
adducitur, qui hunc eundem ordinem in exercitu Cn. Pompei antea
duxerat. At Caesar milites Attianos collaudat, Pupium dimittit,
Auximatibus agit gratias seque eorum facti memorem fore pollicetur.

On learning of Caesar's arrival, the foremost citizens of Auximun
convene in a group to Attius Varus.  They point out that the matter
is not of their deciding; neither they nor the rest of the citizenry
can support that general Caesar, who deserved much from the republic,
having carried out such great deeds, was barred by the defenses of
the town; from this he had a reckoning of his future and of his
peril.  Varus, deeply moved by their speech, withdrew the garrison
that he had brought in and fled.  A few soldiers of Caesar's first
rank pursed him and forced him to make a stand.  After committing to
battle Varus is abandoned by his men; a few divisions of soldiers
march off for home; the rest come over to Caesar, bringing with
them L Pupius, first centurion of the legion, who had formerly held
that selfsame command in the army of Gn Pompey.  But Caesar extols
the Attian soldiers, sends Pupius away, gives thanks to the Auximians
and promises that he will be mindful of their deeds.
