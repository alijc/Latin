Book I section [14] 

Quibus rebus Romam nuntiatis tantus repente terror invasit,
ut cum Lentulus consul ad aperiendum aerarium venisset ad
pecuniamque Pompeio ex senatusconsulto proferendam,
protinus aperto sanctiore aerario ex urbe profugeret.
Caesar enim adventare iam iamque et adesse eius equites
falso nuntiabantur.  Hunc Marcellus collega et plerique
magistratus consecuti sunt.  Cn. Pompeius pridie eius diei
ex urbe profectus iter ad legiones habebat, quas a Caesare
acceptas in Apulia hibernorum causa disposuerat.  Delectus
circa urbem intermittuntur; nihil citra Capuam tutum esse
omnibus videtur.  Capuae primum se confirmant et colligunt
delectumque colonorum, qui lege Iulia Capuam deducti erant,
habere instituunt; gladiatoresque, quos ibi Caesar in ludo
habebat, ad forum productos Lentulus spe libertatis
confirmat atque iis equos attribuit et se sequi iussit;
quos postea monitus ab suis, quod ea res omnium iudicio
reprehendebatur, circum familias conventus Campani
custodiae causa distribuit.



When these matters were reported Rome suddenly fell into
panic, so that when consul Lentulus came to open the
treasury and to advance payment to Pompey by the decree of
the senate, he fled the city as soon as the reserve funds
were revealed, for it was reported, falsely, that Caesar
had already approached and that his cavalry was near at
hand.  Lentulus' colleage Marcellus and most of the
magistracy followed him.  Gnaeus Pompey had set out from
the city the previous day and made a journey to the legions
that he'd gotten from Caesar, which he'd posted in Apulia
for the winter.  The levies going on around the city were
interrupted; no place on this side of Capua seemed to be
defended by anyone.  For the first time, they take courage
at Capua and set up to hold the muster of the farmers who
had been removed to Capua by legal degree; Lentulus brings
the gladiators, that Caesar had there for the games, to the
forum, encourages them with the hope of freedom, and issues
them horses and orders them to follow him: but, after being
warned by his men that this matter was condemned in
everyone's judgment, he distributes them among the
households of the corporation of Campainius for the sake of
protection.
