Book I section[15] 

Auximo Caesar progressus omnem agrum Picenum percurrit.  Cunctae
earum regionum praefecturae libentissimis animis eum recipiunt
exercitumque eius omnibus rebus iuvant.  Etiam Cingulo, quod
oppidum Labienus constituerat suaque pecunia exaedificaverat, ad
eum legati veniunt quaeque imperaverit se cupidissime facturos
pollicentur. Milites imperat: mittunt.  Interea legio XII
Caesarem consequitur.  Cum his duabus Asculum Picenum
proficiscitur.  Id oppidum Lentulus Spinther X cohortibus
tenebat; qui Caesaris adventu cognito profugit ex oppido
cohortesque secum abducere conatus magna parte militum
deseritur.  Relictus in itinere cum paucis incidit in Vibullium
Rufum missum a Pompeio in agrum Picenum confirmandorum hominum
causa.  A quo factus Vibullius certior, quae res in Piceno
gererentur, milites ab eo accipit, ipsum dimittit.  Item ex
finitimis regionibus quas potest contrahit cohortes ex
delectibus Pompeianis; in his Camerino fugientem Lucilium Hirrum
cum sex cohortibus, quas ibi in praesidio habuerat, excipit;
quibus coactis XII efficit.  Cum his ad Domitium Ahenobarbum
Corfinium magnis itineribus pervenit Caesaremque adesse cum
legionibus duabus nuntiat.  Domitius per se circiter XX cohortes
Alba, ex Marsis et Paelignis, finitimis ab regionibus coegerat.



Caesar, after advancing to Auximum, overran the entire district
of Picenum.  Each of the prefectures of the region received him
most happily and assisted his army in all things.  Even from
Cingulum, the town that Labienus had established and constructed
with his own money, envoys came to him and promised that they
would do whatever he commanded.  He demanded soldiers; they sent
them.  Meanwhile the 12th legion reached Caesar, and he set out
for Asculum Picenum with these two.  Lentulus Spinther held that
town with 10 cohorts; but he fled from the town when he learned
of Caesar's arrival and after attempting to lead the cohorts
away with him, was deserted by a large portion of his soldiers.
Left behind on the road with only a few men he happened upon
Vibullius Rufus, who had been sent by Pompey to the district of
Picenum for the sake of encouraging his men.  After Vibullius
was sure about what was going on in Picenum, he took Lentulus'
soldiers and dismissed him.  Likewise, he assembled from the
neighboring regions, where he was able, cohorts from Pompey's
levy.  He received among them Camerinus Lucilius Hirrus, who was
fleeing with the six cohorts that he had had there in the
garrison.  From these that were gathered he formed 13 cohorts.
He brought these to Domitius Ahenobarbus at Corfinium after a
long journey and announced that Caesar was near at hand with two
legions.  Domitius had himself rounded up about 20 cohorts from
Alba, from Marsi and Peligni and bordering regions.
