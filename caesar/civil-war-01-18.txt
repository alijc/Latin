Interim Caesari nuntiatur Sulmonenses, quod oppidum a Corfinio VII
 milium intervallo abest, cupere ea facere, quae vellet, sed a
 Q. Lucretio senatore et Attio Peligno prohiberi, qui id oppidum VII
 cohortium praesidio tenebant.  Mittit eo M. Antonium cum legionis XIII
 cohortibus V. Sulmonenses simul atque signa nostra viderunt, portas
 aperuerunt universique, et oppidani et milites, obviam gratulantes
 Antonio exierunt.  Lucretius et Attius de muro se deiecerunt.  Attius
 ad Antonium deductus petit ut ad Caesarem mitteretur.  Antonius cum
 cohortibus et Attio eodem die, quo profectus erat, revertitur.  Caesar
 eas cohortes cum exercitu suo coniunxit Attiumque incolumem dimisit.
 Caesar primis diebus castra magnis operibus munire et ex finitimis
 municipiis frumentum comportare reliquasque copias exspectare
 instituit.  Eo triduo legio VIII ad eum venit cohortesque ex novis
 Galliae dilectibus XXII equitesque ab rege Norico circiter CCC.
 Quorum adventu altera castra ad alteram oppidi partem ponit; his
 castris Curionem praefecit.  Reliquis diebus oppidum vallo
 castellisque circummunire instituit.  Cuius operis maxima parte
 effecta eodem fere tempore missi a Pompeio revertuntur.


In the meantime it is reported to Caesar that the inhabitants of
Sulmona, a town 7 miles away from Corfinium, desire to do as he wishes,
but are deterred by Senator Q. Lucretius and Attius Pelignus, who held
the town with the aid of 7 cohorts.  He sends M. Antonius there with 5
cohorts of the 13th legion.  As soon as the Sulmonians see our battle
standard, they open the gates and both civilians and soldiers come
sallying forth en masse to meet Antonius and thank him.  Lucretius and
Attius threw themselves over the wall.  Attius, after being taken to
Antonius, asked that he be sent to Caesar.  Antonius returned with the
cohorts and with Attius, who had departed that same day.  Caesar joined
the cohorts up with his army and released Attius unharmed.  During the
next few days Caesar undertook to strengthen the camp with extensive
fortifications, to bring in crops from the surrounding area, and to
wait for the rest of his troops.  In three days the 8th legion and 22
cohorts came to him from a new levy from Gaul, as well as about 300
horsemen from the king of Noricum.  Upon their arrival he placed a
second camp on the other side of the town; and put Curio in charge of
this camp.  For the remaining days he commenced to invest the town with
a wall and redoubts.  These fortifications were nearly completed when the
messengers returned from Pompey.
