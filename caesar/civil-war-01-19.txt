Book I section [19] 

Litteris perlectis Domitius dissimulans in consilio pronuntiat Pompeium
celeriter subsidio venturum hortaturque eos, ne animo deficiant quaeque
usui ad defendendum oppidum sint parent.  Ipse arcano cum paucis
familiaribus suis colloquitur consiliumque fugae capere constituit.  Cum
vultus Domiti cum oratione non consentiret, atque omnia trepidantius
timidiusque ageret, quam superioribus diebus consuesset, multumque cum
suis consiliandi causa secreto praeter consuetudinem colloqueretur,
concilia conventusque hominum fugeret, res diutius tegi dissimularique non
potuit.  Pompeius enim rescripserat: sese rem in summum periculum
deducturum non esse, neque suo consilio aut voluntate Domitium se in
oppidum Corfinium contulisse; proinde, si qua fuisset facultas, ad se cum
omnibus copiis veniret.  Id ne fieri posset, obsidione atque oppidi
circummunitione fiebat.


Having read the letter through, Domitius, concealing the contents,
proclaims in council that Pompey will soon arrive with aid and encourages
them not to let their spirits flag and to prepare whatever they could use
for defending the town.  He himself speaks secretly with a few members of
his household and readies a plan to take flight along with them.  But
since Domitius' demeanor did not match his speech, and in all respects he
acted with more trembling and fearfulness than he'd been wont to in recent
days, and took much counsel in secret with his men, contrary to his
custom, and avoided the councils and gatherings of people, this was a
matter that he could not conceal for very long.  For Pompey had written in
reply: that he was not about to be drawn into the greatest danger, nor by
his plan or desire did Domitius collect himself in the town of Corfinium;
and so, if there were any way whatsoever, he should come with all of his
troops.  This could not be done, as the siege and the investing of the
town was complete.
