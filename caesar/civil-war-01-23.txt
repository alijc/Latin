Book I section [23] 

Caesar, ubi luxit, omnes senatores senatorumque liberos, tribunos
militum equitesque Romanos ad se produci iubet.  Erant
quinquaginta; ordinis senatorii L. Domitius, P. Lentulus Spinther,
L. Caecilius Rufus, Sex. Quintilius Varus quaestor, L. Rubrius;
praeterea filius Domiti aliique complures adulescentes et magnus
numerus equitum Romanorum et decurionum, quos ex municipiis
Domitius evocaverat.  Hos omnes productos a contumeliis militum
conviciisque prohibet; pauca apud eos loquitur, [queritur] quod
sibi a parte eorum gratia relata non sit pro suis in eos maximis
beneficiis; dimittit omnes incolumes.  HS |LX|, quod advexerat
Domitius atque in publico deposuerat, allatum ad se ab IIII viris
Corfiniensibus Domitio reddit, ne continentior in vita hominum quam
in pecunia fuisse videatur, etsi eam pecuniam publicam esse
constabat datamque a Pompeio in stipendium.  Milites Domitianos
sacramentum apud se dicere iubet atque eo die castra movet
iustumque iter conficit VII omnino dies ad Corfinium commoratus, et
per fines Marrucinorum, Frentranorum, Larinatium in Apuliam
pervenit.



When it was light, Caesar orders all of the senators and their
children, the military tribunes and the Roman knights to be brought
to him.  There were fifty of senatorial rank, L. Domitius,
P. Lentulus Spinther, L. Caecilius Rufus, Sextus Quintilius Varus,
the quaestor, L. Rubrius; besides the son of Domitius and several
other young men and a large number of Roman knights and calvary
officers that Domitius had summoned out of the towns.  When they
had been brought up, he wards off the rough treatment and abuse of
his soldiers; he gives them a short speech, he complains that from
their part gratitude had not been rendered to him for his great
kindnesses towards them; he sends them all away unharmed.  60, that
Domitius had brought here and had deposited into the public purse,
he returns to Domitius, using 4 Corfinian men, lest he might seem
to be more moderate in men's lives than in property, even though it
was well-known that the money had been given by Pompey for paying
his soldiers.  He orders Domitius' soldiers to swear an oath in his
presence and moves the camp that very day and completely makes a
reasonable journey, having stopped for 7 days in all at Corfinium,
and passes through the territories of the Marrucians, the
Frentrians and the Larinatians to arrive in Apulia.
