Book I section  [31] 

Nacti vacuas ab imperiis Sardiniam Valerius, Curio Siciliam,
cum exercitibus eo perveniunt.  Tubero cum in Africam
venisset, invenit in provincia cum imperio Attium Varum; qui
ad Auximum, ut supra demonstravimus, amissis cohortibus
protinus ex fuga in Africam pervenerat atque eam sua sponte
vacuam occupaverat delectuque habito duas legiones
effecerat, hominum et locorum notitia et usu eius provinciae
nactus aditus ad ea conanda, quod paucis ante annis ex
praetura eam provinciam obtinuerat.  Hic venientem Uticam
navibus Tuberonem portu atque oppido prohibet neque adfectum
valetudine filium exponere in terra patitur, sed sublatis
ancoris excedere eo loco cogit.


When Valerius and Curio reached Sardinia and Sicily, they
found them to be uncommanded.  After Tubero arrived in
Africa, he found the province under the command of Attius
Varus, who, as we have shown above, had fled to Africa right
after losing his cohorts at Auximum and, finding it
uncommanded, had captured it no resistance.  He raised a
levy and had mustered two legions, by his knowledge and
familiarity of the men and of places of the province, having
gotten the chance for the endeavor, because a few years
earlier he had recieved the province after his praetorship.
This man keeps Tubero, coming to Utica by ship, from the
harbor and town.  Nor does he allow Tubero's sick son to
disembark, but Tubero is forced to weigh anchor and
withdraw from there.
