Book I section[40] 

Fabius finitimarum civitatum animos litteris nuntiisque
temptabat.  In Sicori flumine pontes effecerat duos distantes
inter se milia passuum IIII.  His pontibus pabulatum mittebat,
quod ea quae citra flumen fuerant, superioribus diebus
consumpserat.  Hoc idem fere atque eadem de causa Pompeiani
exercitus duces faciebant, crebroque inter se equestribus
proeliis contendebant.  Huc cum cotidiana consuetudine congressae
pabulatoribus praesidio propiore ponte legiones Fabianae duae
flumen transissent, impedimentaque et omnis equitatus sequeretur,
subito vi ventorum et aquae magnitudine pons est interruptus et
reliqua multitudo equitum interclusa.  Quo cognito a Petreio et
Afranio ex aggere atque cratibus, quae flumine ferebantur,
celeriter suo ponte Afranius, quem oppido castrisque coniunctum
habebat, legiones IIII equitatumque omnem traiecit duabusque
Fabianis occurrit legionibus.  Cuius adventu nuntiato L. Plancus,
qui legionibus praeerat, necessaria re coactus locum capit
superiorem diversamque aciem in duas partes constituit, ne ab
equitatu circumveniri posset.  Ita congressus impari numero
magnos impetus legionum equitatusque sustinet.  Commisso ab
equitibus proelio signa legionum duarum procul ab utrisque
conspiciuntur, quas C. Fabius ulteriore ponte subsidio nostris
miserat suspicatus fore id, quod accidit, ut duces adversariorum
occasione et beneficio fortunae ad nostros opprimendos uterentur.
Quarum adventu proelium dirimitur, ac suas uterque legiones
reducit in castra.


Fabius tested the mettle of the neighoring cities with letters
and messengers.  He completed two separate bridges over the River
Sicoris 4 miles apart.  He sent forage over these bridges,
because he had already used up what was on the near side of the
river in the preceeding days.  The generals for Pompey's army
were doing the same fiercely, and there frequently battles
between the cavalries.  After passed this way on a daily basis,
two of Fabianus' legions, being protection for the foragers,
crossed the river over the nearer bridge, with the heavy baggage
and all the cavalry following.  Suddenly the bridge was broken up
by a powerful surge of wind and water and a great number of the
remaining horse were cut off.  When Petreius and Afranius learned
of this, from the wreckage carried down on the river, Afranius,
quickly transferred 4 legions and all their cavalry to the bridge
that had a direct connection with the camp, and opposed Fabius
with his two legions.  Upon the arrival of his messenger, L
Plancus, who commanded the legions, compelled by necessity,
siezed the high ground and established separate battle lines in
two sections, to prevent his being encircled by cavalry.  And so,
engaging with an unequal number he sustained powerful assaults of
infantry and horse.  When the cavalry had joined the battle, the
standards of two legions were spied at a distance, which
C. Fabius had sent to the further bridge with the reinforcements
of our men, having suspected what fell out, that the generals of
the opposing armies, by chance and the benefit of luck would take
advantage of our overwhelmed men.  The battle was interrupted by
their arrival, and both legions withdrew into their camps.
