[50] Hae permanserunt aquae dies complures. Conatus est Caesar
reficere pontes; sed nec magnitudo fluminis permittebat, neque ad
ripam dispositae cohortes adversariorum perfici patiebantur. Quod
illis prohibere erat facile cum ipsius fluminis natura atque aquae
magnitudine, tum quod ex totis ripis in unum atque angustum locum tela
iaciebantur; atque erat difficile eodem tempore rapidissimo flumine
opera perficere et tela vitare.

These high waters lasted for several days.  Caesar attempted to
rebuild the bridges; but the height of the river did not permit it,
nor did the enemy cohorts that had been positioned on the river
bank allow it.  For it was easy for them to hold us off, what with
the nature of the river and the height of the water, and because
they threw spears from every part of the river bank into our single
constricted position; and at the time the swift current made it
difficult to complete the work and to avoid the spears.
