51.1 

Nuntiatur Afranio magnos commeatus, qui iter habebant ad Caesarem,
ad flumen constitisse.  Venerant eo sagittarii ex Rutenis, equites
ex Gallia cum multis carris magnisque impedimentis, ut fert Gallica
consuetudo.  Erant praeterea cuiusque generis hominum milia circiter
VI cum servis liberisque; sed nullus ordo, nullum imperium certum,
cum suo quisque consilio uteretur atque omnes sine timore iter
facerent usi superiorum temporum atque itinerum licentia.  Erant
complures honesti adulescentes, senatorum filii et ordinis
equestris; erant legationes civitatum; erant legati Caesaris.  Hos
omnes flumina continebant.  Ad hos opprimendos cum omni equitatu
tribusque legionibus Afranius de nocte proficiscitur imprudentesque
ante missis equitibus aggreditur.  Celeriter sese tamen Galli
equites expediunt proeliumque committunt.  Ei, dum pari certamine
res geri potuit, magnum hostium numerum pauci sustinuere; sed ubi
signa legionum appropinquare coeperunt, paucis amissis sese in
proximos montes conferunt.  Hoc pugnae tempus magnum attulit nostris
ad salutem momentum; nacti enim spatium se in loca superiora
receperunt.  Desiderati sunt eo die sagittarii circiter CC, equites
pauci, calonum atque impedimentorum non magnus numerus.



It is announced to Afranius that a great supply train on its way to
Caesar was held up at the river.  Archers had come there from the
Ruteni, horsemen from Gaul, with many wagons and a great deal of
baggage, as is the custom of Gaul.  There were in addition around 6
thousand men of all sorts, with their slaves and freedmen; but no
order, no set command, since each man followed his own plan and they
all made the trip without anxiety having been used to the liberty of
the journeys of previous seasons.  There were a good number of
upright young men, sons of senators and with a knight's rank; there
were legations of the towns; there were envoys of Caesar.  All these
were held up by the river.  In the night Afranius sets out for these
confined men with all his cavalry and three legions and first off
advances on those unsuspecting men with the cavalry that he'd sent
in advance.  However, the Gallic cavalry quickly make themselves
ready and engage in battle.  While the business could be carried out
in an equal struggle those few held off a great number of the enemy;
but when the legions' standards started to advance on them they
carried themselves off to the nearby mountains with the loss of a
few men.  This period of battle brought great change to the welfare
of our men; for they recovered themselves to obtain a position on
the higher ground.  Around 200 archers were lost on that day, along
with a few horsemen, an not too many soldiers' servants and baggage.
