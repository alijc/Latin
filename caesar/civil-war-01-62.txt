Qua re per exploratores cognita summo labore militum Caesar
continuato diem noctemque opere in flumine avertendo huc iam rem
deduxerat, ut equites, etsi difficulter atque aegre fiebat, possent
tamen atque auderent flumen transire, pedites vero tantummodo umeris
ac summo pectore exstarent et cum altitudine aquae tum etiam
rapiditate fluminis ad transeundum impedirentur.  Sed tamen eodem
fere tempore pons in Hibero prope effectus nuntiabatur, et in Sicori
vadum reperiebatur.

When Caesar learned of this business through the scouts, through 
the utmost exertion of his soldiers, working continuously, day and
night, he'd already succeeded in diverting the river to the point of
drawing it down, so that the cavalry were able to venture to cross 
the river, albeit only with difficulty. In truth, only the heads and 
shoulders of the infantry were visible, and they were prevented from 
crossing by the depth of the water, and moreover by the swiftness of 
the current.  But at nearly the same time it was reported that the 
bridge over the Ebro was nearing completion, and that a ford on the 
Sicorus was found.
