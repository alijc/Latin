66.1 

Media circiter nocte eis, qui aquandi causa longius a castris
processerant, ab equitibus correptis fit ab his certior Caesar
duces adversariorum silentio copias castris educere.  Quo
cognito signum dari iubet et vasa militari more conclamari.
Illi exaudito clamore veriti, ne noctu impediti sub onere
confligere cogerentur aut ne ab equitatu Caesaris in angustius
tenerentur, iter supprimunt copiasque in castris continent.
Postero die Petreius cum paucis equitibus occulte ad exploranda
loca proficiscitur.  Hoc idem fit ex castris Caesaris.  Mittitur
L. Decidius Sasa cum paucis, qui loci naturam perspiciat.
Uterque idem suis renuntiat: V milia passuum proxima intercedere
itineris campestris, inde excipere loca aspera et montuosa; qui
prior has angustias occupaverit, ab hoc hostem prohiberi nihil
esse negotii.

About the middle of the night Caesar was informed, by way of men
who had gone too far from their camp to fetch water and had been
captured by our cavalry, that the enemy commanders were silently
leading their forces out of their camp.  On learning this he
ordered the alarm to be shouted and the signal to be given to
march.  The enemy, clearly hearing the war-cry and fearing that
they'd join battle in the night while wearing their packs or be
checked in close quarters by Caesar's cavalry, halted their
march and kept their forces safe in camp.  On the next day
Petreius set out covertly with a few horse to reconnoiter.  The
same thing was done from Caesar's camp.  L. Decidius Sasa was
sent out with a few men to spy out the nature of the place.
Both reported the same thing: that the first 5 miles were over
level ground, but what came after that were uneven and
mountainous places; and that whoever first captured those narrow
passes, would easily be able to keep the enemy at bay.
