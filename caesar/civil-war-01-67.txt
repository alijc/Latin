Disputatur in consilio a Petreio atque Afranio et tempus
profectionis quaeritur.  Plerique censebant, ut noctu iter facerent:
posse prius ad angustias veniri, quam sentiretur.  Alii, quod pridie
noctu conclamatum esset in Caesaris castris, argumenti sumebant loco
non posse clam exiri.  Circumfundi noctu equitatum Caesaris atque
omnia loca atque itinera obsidere; nocturnaque proelia esse vitanda,
quod perterritus miles in civili dissensione timori magis quam
religioni consulere consuerit.  At lucem multum per se pudorem
omnium oculis, multum etiam tribunorum militum et centurionum
praesentiam afferre; quibus rebus coerceri milites et in officio
contineri soleant.  Quare omni ratione esse interdiu perrumpendum:
etsi aliquo accepto detrimento, tamen summa exercitus salva locum,
quem petant, capi posse.  Haec vincit in consilio sententia, et
prima luce postridie constituunt proficisci.


Petreius and Afranius called a strategy session to discuss the
situation and find the right time for setting out.  The majority
proposed that they should march out during the night: so that they
could reach the passes before they were noticed.  Others, because of
the uproar that had gone on in Caesar's camp the night before,
assumed on the basis of that evidence that they wouldn't be able to
march out in secret.  For they would be hard-pressed in the night
and Caesar's cavalry would occupy all stations and roads; and that
they needed to avoid nighttime battles.  For a frightened soldier in
a civil strife would be accustomed to have more regard for fear than
for duty - but, he would bring great shame on himself in the eyes of
all in the light of day, and would do so in the presence of many of
the military tribunes and centurions.  Being sustained by these, the
soldiers were more wont to hold to their duty.  And so by every
reckoning they must break through in the daytime: even if they took
some losses, yet the greatest part of the army would be unharmed and
the place that they were going to attack could be captured.  This
opinion prevailed in the debate, and they resolved to set out at
first light on the next day.
