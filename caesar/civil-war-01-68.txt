[68] Caesar exploratis regionibus albente caelo omnes copias
castris educit magnoque circuitu nullo certo itinere exercitum
ducit.  Nam quae itinera ad Hiberum atque Octogesam pertinebant
castris hostium oppositis tenebantur.  Ipsi erant transcendendae
valles maximae ac difficillimae; saxa multis locis praerupta iter
impediebant, ut arma per manus necessario traderentur, militesque
inermes sublevatique alii ab aliis magnam partem itineris
conficerent.  Sed hunc laborem recusabat nemo, quod eum omnium
laborum finem fore existimabant, si hostem Hibero intercludere et
frumento prohibere potuissent.

Caesar, having reconnoitered the environs, led all the troops out
of the camp as soon as the sky grew light and led the army in a
great cross-country circuit.  For the roads that extended to the
Ebro and Octogesa were controlled by the camps of the enemy.  Long
and hard ascents from the valleys fell to him; and steep rocks
hampered their way in many places, so that they had to pass their
weapons to others and cover a great part of the way unarmed and
unemcumbered.  But no one objected to this toil, because they
thought that it would be the end of all their labor if they could
cut the enemy off from the Ebro and keep him from supplies.
