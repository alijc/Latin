74.1 

Quorum discessu liberam nacti milites colloquiorum facultatem vulgo
procedunt, et quem quisque in castris notum aut municipem habebat
conquirit atque evocat.  Primum agunt gratias omnibus, quod sibi
perterritis pridie pepercissent: eorum se beneficio vivere.  Deinde
de imperatoris fide quaerunt, rectene se illi sint commissuri, et
quod non ab initio fecerint armaque cum hominibus necessariis et
consanguineis contulerint, queruntur.  His provocati sermonibus
fidem ab imperatore de Petreii atque Afranii vita petunt, ne quod in
se scelus concepisse neu suos prodidisse videantur.  Quibus
confirmatis rebus se statim signa translaturos confirmant legatosque
de pace primorum ordinum centuriones ad Caesarem mittunt.  Interim
alii suos in castra invitandi causa adducunt, alii ab suis
abducuntur, adeo ut una castra iam facta ex binis viderentur;
compluresque tribuni militum et centuriones ad Caesarem veniunt
seque ei commendant.  Idem hoc fit a principibus Hispaniae, quos
evocaverant et secum in castris habebant obsidum loco.  Hi suos
notos hospitesque quaerebant, per quem quisque eorum aditum
commendationis haberet ad Caesarem.  Afranii etiam filius adulescens
de sua ac parentis sui salute cum Caesare per Sulpicium legatum
agebat.  Erant plena laetitia et gratulatione omnia, eorum, qui
tanta pericula vitasse, et eorum, qui sine vulnere tantas res
confecisse videbantur, magnumque fructum suae pristinae lenitatis
omnium iudicio Caesar ferebat, consiliumque eius a cunctis
probabatur.

After they (Afranius and Petreius) had left, the soldiers, having
gotten an unfettered oportunity for conversation, went out en masse,
and anyone who had a friend or neighbor in the other camp sought him
out and called to him.  First of all they thanked them for sparing
them the day before, when they'd been thoroughly frightened: saying
that they'd survived by their kindness.  Then they asked about the
general's credibility, that it would not be meet for them to do
battle, and lamented that they did from the beginning when men bound
by friendship and kin gathered up their arms.  Summoned by these
words, they asked for good faith from the general concerning the
lives of Petrius and Afranius, so they wouldn't themselves be seem
to be wicked or to betray their own leaders.  When this had been
confirmed, they immediately declared that they would carry their
standards across and sent envoys of peace from the chief ranks of
the centurions to Caesar.  In the meantime men pass from one camp to
the other and back, so much so that it seems that both camps have
merged into a single one; and many of the military tribunes and
centurions come to Caesar, entrusting their lives to him.  The same
thing was done by the Spanish leaders, who had been summoned and
were being held hostage in the camp.  The men looked for for their
own friends and fellows, through whom each of them might have a
chance of being commended to Caesar.  Even Afranius' youthful son
dealt with Caesar, through the envoy Sulpicius, on behalf of his own
safety and his father's.  They were filled with joy and all
rejoicing, of those who had avoided such great danger, and of those
who seemed to have carried off such things without injury, and in
the opinion of all Caesar bore the great profits by his former
lenience, and his plan was approved by all.
