[80] Tali dum pugnatur modo, lente atque paulatim proceditur,
crebroque, ut sint auxilio suis, subsistunt; ut tum accidit.
Milia enim progressi IIII vehementiusque peragitati ab equitatu
montem excelsum capiunt ibique una fronte contra hostem castra
muniunt neque iumentis onera deponunt.  Ubi Caesaris castra posita
tabernaculaque constituta et dimissos equites pabulandi causa
animum adverterunt, sese subito proripiunt hora circiter sexta
eiusdem diei et spem nacti morae discessu nostrorum equitum iter
facere incipiunt.  Qua re animum adversa Caesar refectis
legionibus subsequitur, praesidio impedimentis paucas cohortes
relinquit; hora x subsequi pabulatores equitesque revocari iubet.
Celeriter equitatus ad cotidianum itineris officium revertitur.
Pugnatur acriter ad novissimum agmen, adeo ut paene terga
convertant, compluresque milites, etiam nonnulli centuriones,
interficiuntur.  Instabat agmen Caesaris atque universum
imminebat.


While the battle went on in this way, the army advanced slowly and
surely, and, as it happened, they repeatedly halted to aid their
own men.  In fact, after advancing 4 miles and being quite
vigorously harrassed by our cavalry, they seized a commanding
height and threw up a defensive line there, without even unpacking
their mules.  When Caesar's men had pitched camp and set up tents
and sent the cavalry out to forage, they changed course, suddenly
breaking camp around noon, and seizing the hope that our cavalry
would be delayed in decamping, they resume their march.  When
Caesar noticed this, he pursued with his refitted legions, leaving
a few cohorts behind to guard the baggage; he commanded the
foragers and cavalry to be recalled to join the pursuit in the
afternoon.  The cavalry quickly returned to their usual marching
orders.  The battle raged at the rearmost column so fiercely that
they nearly turned tail and ran, and many soldiers, and even a few
centurions, were killed.  Caesar's entire army was approaching
them and threatening them.
