12.1
Qua nova re oblata omnis administratio belli consistit,
militesque aversi a proelio ad studium audiendi et cognoscendi feruntur.

Ubi hostes ad legatos exercitumque pervenerunt,
universi se ad pedes proiciunt;
orant, ut adventus Caesaris exspectetur:
captam suam urbem videre:
opera perfecta, turrim subrutam;
itaque ab defensione desistere.

Nullam exoriri moram posse, quominus,
cum venisset, si imperata non facerent ad nutum, e vestigio diriperentur.

Docent, si omnino turris concidisset,
non posse milites contineri,
quin spe praedae in urbem irrumperent urbemque delerent.

Haec atque eiusdem generis complura ut ab hominibus doctis magna
cum misericordia fletuque pronuntiantur.


When this news was presented every operation of the war came to a halt,
and the soldiers who had turned away from battle were brought to an enthusiasm
for listening and learning.

When the enemy reached the commanders and army
they all threw themselves down at their feet;
they begged them to wait for Caesar's arrival
to see his captured city, the completed fortifications, the undermined tower;
and so pledged to give up their defense.

>no delay to come out to be able, that not,
when he had come, if orders not they had done on command from track they might
plunder.

They pointed out that the tower, if it had falled altogether,
wouldn't be able to hold back the soldiers,
but that, in hope of spoils, they'd force their way into the city and destroy
it. 

these things and many of the same sort as 
were proclaimed by learned men with great compassion and tears.
