13.1 Quibus rebus commoti legati milites ex opere deducunt,
oppugnatione desistunt;
operibus custodias relinquunt.

Indutiarum quodam genere misericordia facto adventus Caesaris exspectatur.

Nullum ex muro, nullum a nostris mittitur telum;
ut re confecta omnes curam et diligentiam remittunt.

Caesar enim per litteras Trebonio magnopere mandaverat,
ne per vim oppidum expugnari pateretur,
ne gravius permoti milites et defectionis odio et contemptione sui et diutino
labore omnes puberes interficerent;

quod se facturos minabantur,
aegreque tunc sunt retenti,
quin oppidum irrumperent,
graviterque eam rem tulerunt,
quod stetisse per Trebonium,
quominus oppido potirentur,
videbatur.

The legates, moved by these things, withdrew the soldiers from the
fortifications and halted the siege; the pickets abandoned their posts.

With a certain sort of truce having been accomplished, 
the arrival of Caesar was awaited with compassion.

Not a spear was cast, either by us or from the wall;
as the business was finished, everyone relaxed their care and attentiveness.

For Caesar had expressly commanded, in a letter to Trebonius,
that the town would not be permitted to be stormed by force,
that the soldiers must not, deeply roused by a hatred of failure
and their scorn and long labor, kill the adults;


it seemed that they themselves threatened those about to act,
and were barely held back then,
to keep them from rushing into the town,
and they bore the matter more deeply,

that/because to have stood at Trebonius' account,
that not they might possess the town,
