13.1 Quibus rebus commoti legati milites ex opere deducunt,
oppugnatione desistunt;
operibus custodias relinquunt.

Indutiarum quodam genere misericordia facto adventus Caesaris exspectatur.

Nullum ex muro, nullum a nostris mittitur telum;
ut re confecta omnes curam et diligentiam remittunt.

Caesar enim per litteras Trebonio magnopere mandaverat,
ne per vim oppidum expugnari pateretur,
ne gravius permoti milites et defectionis odio et contemptione sui et diutino
labore omnes puberes interficerent;

quod se facturos minabantur,
aegreque tunc sunt retenti,
quin oppidum irrumperent,
graviterque eam rem tulerunt,
quod stetisse per Trebonium,
quominus oppido potirentur,
videbatur.

by which things the moved legates soldiers from the works are drawn,
they halt the siege;
the pickets abandon the fortifications.

of truce by which birth compassion having been done the arrival of Caesar
was awaited.

Not a spear was cast, either by us or from the wall;
as the matter was finished, everyone relaxed their concern and attentiveness.

For Caesar had expressly commanded, in a letter to Trebonius,
that not through force the town to be stormed might be allowed,
that not the more heavily stirred up soldiers and of faintness by/to their
hatred and scorn and long labor all might kill the adults;

that/because they threatened/were driven selves >those about to act,
and scarcely then are relaxed/held back,
so that not the town they might invade/rush into,
and more deeply/violently bear the matter,
that/because to have stood/stayed through Trebonius,
that not they might possess the town,
he/it was seeming.
