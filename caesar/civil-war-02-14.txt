14.1 At hostes sine fide tempus atque occasionem fraudis ac doli
quaerunt interiectisque aliquot diebus nostris languentibus atque
animo remissis subito meridiano tempore, cum alius discessisset,
alius ex diutino labore in ipsis operibus quieti se dedisset,
arma vero omnia reposita contectaque essent, portis se foras
erumpunt, secundo magnoque vento ignem operibus inferunt.  Hunc
sic distulit ventus, uti uno tempore agger, plutei, testudo,
turris, tormenta flammam conciperent et prius haec omnia
consumerentur, quam, quemadmodum accidisset, animadverti posset.
Nostri repentina fortuna permoti arma, quae possunt, arripiunt;
alii ex castris sese incitant.  Fit in hostes impetus; sed de
muro sagittis tormentisque fugientes persequi prohibentur.  Illi
sub murum se recipiunt ibique musculum turrimque latericiam
libere incendunt.  Ita multorum mensium labor hostium perfidia et
vi tempestatis puncto temporis interiit.  Temptaverunt hoc idem
Massilienses postero die.  Eandem nacti tempestatem maiore cum
fiducia ad alteram turrim aggeremque eruptione pugnaverunt
multumque ignem intulerunt.  Sed ut superioris temporis
contentionem nostri omnem remiserant, ita proximi diei casu
admoniti omnia ad defensionem paraverant.  Itaque multis
interfectis reliquos infecta re in oppidum reppulerunt.


But the faithless enemy looked for time and opportunity for
deceit and trickery, and after an interval of several days, with
our men tired and slack in spirits, suddenly, at midday, when
some had withdrawn, and others, due to their long labor on their
own fortifications, had surrendered themselves to rest, indeed,
with the arms picked up and laid away, the enemy burst out of the
gates, and with a great and favorable wind they set fire to the
fortifications.  This wind so spread, that the rampart,
breastworks, tortoise, towers, and catapults all caught on fire
at the same time, and before what had happened could be noticed,
all these were burnt up in that way.  Our men, roused by the
unexpected turn of fate, seized what weapons they could; others
rushed out of the camp.  An attack against the enemy took place;
but catapults and arrows from the wall prevented our men from
pursuing the fleeing men.  They withdrew to the base of the wall
and there burned the mouse and the brick tower without
interference.  So by the treachery of the enemy and the force of
the weather, the work of many months was ruined in a single point
of time.  The Massilians tried the same thing the next day.  The
weather being the same as before, it was with great confidence
that they launched a sortie at the other tower and rampart,
carrying much fire with them.  But as our men had sent back all
their effort the previous time, so on the next day, forewarned by
chance, they had been in all respects prepared for their defense.
And so, after many had been killed, they drove the rest back into
the town, with their mission left unaccomplished.
