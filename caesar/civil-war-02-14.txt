14.1
At hostes sine fide tempus atque occasionem fraudis
ac doli quaerunt interiectisque
aliquot diebus nostris languentibus
atque animo remissis subito meridiano tempore,
cum alius discessisset,
alius ex diutino labore in ipsis operibus quieti se dedisset,
arma vero omnia reposita contectaque essent,
portis se foras erumpunt,
secundo magnoque vento ignem operibus inferunt.

Hunc sic distulit ventus,
uti uno tempore agger, plutei, testudo, turris, tormenta flammam conciperent
et prius haec omnia consumerentur,
quam, quemadmodum accidisset, animadverti posset.

Nostri repentina fortuna permoti arma, quae possunt, arripiunt;
alii ex castris sese incitant.

Fit in hostes impetus;
sed de muro sagittis tormentisque fugientes persequi prohibentur.

Illi sub murum se recipiunt ibique musculum turrimque latericiam libere
incendunt.

Ita multorum mensium labor hostium perfidia
et vi tempestatis puncto temporis interiit.

Temptaverunt hoc idem Massilienses postero die.

Eandem nacti tempestatem maiore cum fiducia ad alteram turrim aggeremque
eruptione pugnaverunt multumque ignem intulerunt.

Sed ut superioris temporis contentionem nostri omnem remiserant,
ita proximi diei casu admoniti omnia ad defensionem paraverant.

Itaque multis interfectis reliquos infecta re in oppidum reppulerunt.


But the faithless enemy looked for time and opportunity for deceit and trickery,
and after an interval of several days, with our men tired and slack in spirits,
suddenly, at midday,
when one watch had withdrawn,
the other, due to their long labor on their own fortifications,
surrendered themselves to rest,
in truth, all the arms that had been concealed were gotten out,
they burst out of the gates,
and with a great and favorable wind they set fire to the fortifications.

This wind so spread, that the rampart, breastworks,
tortoise, towers, and catapults all caught on fire at the same time,
and before what had happened could be noticed, all these were burnt up
in that way.

Our men, roused by the unexpected turn of fate,
seized the what weapons they could;
others urged themselves out of the camp.

An attack into the enemy took place;
but from the wall archers and catapults burning prevented pursuit.

They recovered themselves under the wall and there mouse and brick tower freely
burned.  

So by the treachery of the enemy and the force of the weather,
the work of many months was ruined in a single point of time.

The Massilians tried the same thing the next day.

The weather being the same as before, it was with great confidence
that they launched a sortie at the other tower and rampart,
bringing in much fire.

But as our men had sent back all their effort during the last time,
so on the next day by chance forewarned they had been prepared in all respects
for their defense.

And so, after many had been killed, they drove the rest back into the town,
with their mission not accomplished.
