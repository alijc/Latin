16.1 Quod ubi hostes viderunt, ea, quae vix longinquo spatio refici
non posse sperassent, paucorum dierum opera et labore ita refecta,
ut nullus perfidiae neque eruptioni locus esset nec quicquam omnino
relinqueretur, qua aut telis militibus aut igni operibus noceri
posset, eodemque exemplo sentiunt totam urbem, qua sit aditus ab
terra, muro turribusque circumiri posse, sic ut ipsis consistendi
in suis munitionibus locus non esset, cum paene inaedificata muris
ab exercitu nostro moenia viderentur ac telum manu coniceretur,
suorumque tormentorum usum, quibus ipsi magna speravissent, spatio
propinquitatis interire parique condicione ex muro ac turribus
bellandi data se virtute nostris adaequare non posse intellegunt,
ad easdem deditionis condiciones recurrunt.

The enemy saw that 
we had rebuilt, within a few days by such effort and exertion,
what they had hoped couldn't possibly be rebuilt for a very long
time,
so that there was no occasion for treachery or sallying out,
and that nothing at all was left
with which to harm the soldiers with darts or the fortifications with fire.


In the same way they perceived that the whole city,
where it had access from land,
could be surrounded by a wall and towers,
so that there wouldn't be a way for them to make a stand in their own fortifications, 

since the ramparts that our army had nearly finished building on the
walls were seen, and a spear might be cast in by hand,

the use of their catapults, that they'd put great hope in,

the space of the nearness to go among
and by the same condition from the wall and towers for fighting

they realized that they could not come up to the level of our men in the given strength,

they ran back to the conditions for surrender.
