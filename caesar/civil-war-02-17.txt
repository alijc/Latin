17.1

M. Varro in ulteriore Hispania initio cognitis eis rebus,
quae sunt in Italia gestae,
diffidens Pompeianis rebus amicissime de Caesare loquebatur:
praeoccupatum sese legatione ab Cn. Pompeio teneri obstrictum fide;
necessitudinem quidem sibi nihilo minorem cum Caesare intercedere,
neque se ignorare,
quod esset officium legati,
qui fiduciariam operam obtineret,
quae vires suae,
quae voluntas erga Caesarem totius provinciae.

Haec omnibus ferebat sermonibus neque se in ullam partem movebat.

Postea vero, cum Caesarem ad Massiliam detineri cognovit,
copias Petreii cum exercitu Afranii esse coniunctas,
magna auxilia convenisse,
magna esse in spe atque exspectari et consentire omnem citeriorem provinciam,
quaeque postea acciderant,
de angustiis ad Ilerdam rei fumentariae,
accepit,
atque haec ad eum latius atque inflatius Afranius perscribebat,
se quoque ad motus fortunae movere coepit.

When M. Varro, in furthest Spain, had first learned about what was going on in
Italy, he distrusted Pompey's business and spoke about Caesar with the utmost
goodwill:
that a legation from Gnaeus Pompey prevented him from being bound by loyalty:
indeed his obligation was nothing less than to oppose Caesar,
and not to disregard him,
because it was the duty of an envoy,
who had obtained the office based on trust,
which his forces,
which goodwill of the whole province towards Caesar.

He spoke of this in every word and didn't stir himself at all.

In truth, later, he learned that Caesar was delayed at Massilia,
that Petreius' troops had joined up with Afranius' army,
that great auxilliaries had assembled,
that each nearby province was in great hope and expected to act together,
which is what later happened,
he acquired provisions from the straits to Ilerda,
and Afrianius was exaggerating these things to him,
and so he started to shift to the emotion of fortune.
