M. Varro in ulteriore Hispania initio cognitis eis rebus,
quae sunt in Italia gestae,
diffidens Pompeianis rebus amicissime de Caesare loquebatur:
praeoccupatum sese legatione ab Cn. Pompeio teneri obstrictum fide;
necessitudinem quidem sibi nihilo minorem cum Caesare intercedere,
neque se ignorare,
quod esset officium legati,
qui fiduciariam operam obtineret,
quae vires suae,
quae voluntas erga Caesarem totius provinciae.

Haec omnibus ferebat sermonibus neque se in ullam partem movebat.

Postea vero, cum Caesarem ad Massiliam detineri cognovit,
copias Petreii cum exercitu Afranii esse coniunctas,
magna auxilia convenisse,
magna esse in spe atque exspectari et consentire omnem citeriorem provinciam,
quaeque postea acciderant,
de angustiis ad Ilerdam rei fumentariae,
accepit,
atque haec ad eum latius atque inflatius Afranius perscribebat,
se quoque ad motus fortunae movere coepit.

M. Varro in furthest Spain to/by the beginning having been acquainted with the
things, which are carried out in Italy,
distrusting Pompey's affairs with the utmost goodwill about Caesar he spoke:
that he himself expected to/by a legation from Gnaeus Pompey to be held bound by
loyalty:
indeed the obligation to himself to/by nothing less with Caesar to intervene,
neither for himself to ignore,
because/that it might be obligation of the envoy,
who might have obtained work held on trust,
which his forces,
which goodwill towards Caesar of the whole province.

These things to/by all words he brought and not moved self in any part.

Afterwards in truth, as he learned that Caesar was detained at Massilia,
>troops of Petrius with army of Afranius to be joined,
great auxilliaries to be assembled,
great to be in hope and to be expected and to act together >each nearby
province,
whichever afterwards had happened,
about straits to Ilerda ????
he accepted/admitted/got,
and these things to him wider and inflated Afrianius was reporting,
self likewise moved by fortune began to move.
