18.1

Delectum habuit tota provincia,
legionibus completis duabus cohortes circiter XXX alarias addidit.

Frumenti magnum numerum coegit,
quod Massiliensibus, item quod Afranio Petreioque mitteret.

Naves longas X Gaditanis ut facerent imperavit,
complures praeterea [in] Hispali faciendas curavit.

Pecuniam omnem omniaque ornamenta ex fano Herculis in oppidum Gades contulit;
eo sex cohortes praesidii causa ex provincia misit Gaiumque Gallonium,
equitem Romanum, familiarem Domitii,
qui eo procurandae hereditatis causa venerat missus a Domitio,
oppido Gadibus praefecit;
arma omnia privata ac publica in domum Gallonii contulit.

Ipse habuit graves in Caesarem contiones.

Saepe ex tribunali praedicavit adversa Caesarem proelia fecisse,
magnum numerum ab eo militum ad Afranium perfugisse:
haec se certis nuntiis,
certis auctoribus comperisse.

Quibus rebus perterritos cives Romanos eius provinciae sibi ad rem publicam
administrandam HS CCXXX et argenti pondo XX milia,
tritici modium CXX milia polliceri coegit.


He picked from the entire province,
added to/by complete/filled legions two cohorts around 30 auxiliary cavalry.

He gathered a great supply of provisions,
to send to the Massilians, and to Afranius and Petreius as well.

He ordered the Gaditanes to make 10 galleys,
and arranged the building of many others in Spain.

He collected all the money and equipment from the temple of Hercules in the
town of Gades;
he sent to him six cohorts for a garrison/guard from the province and Gaius
Gallonius, a Roman knight of Domitius' household,
who to him of/to the management for the sake of inheritance/possession a
had come, sent by Domitius,
he put the Gaditanes in charge of the town;
he collected all the arms, public and private, in the house of Gallonius.

He made heavy speeches against Caesar.

From his tribunal he often proclaimed that Caesar had waged hostile battles,
that a great number of soldiers had deserted from him to Afranius:
that he'd learned these things from reliable messengers and authorities.

Through these things he forced the terrified Roman citizens of his province
to promise to him to the republic management
230 sesterces and 20,000 by weight of silver,
of wheat 120,000 pecks to promise he collected.
