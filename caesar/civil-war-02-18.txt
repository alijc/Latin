18.1 Delectum habuit tota provincia, legionibus completis duabus
cohortes circiter XXX alarias addidit.  Frumenti magnum numerum
coegit, quod Massiliensibus, item quod Afranio Petreioque
mitteret.  Naves longas X Gaditanis ut facerent imperavit,
complures praeterea [in] Hispali faciendas curavit.  Pecuniam
omnem omniaque ornamenta ex fano Herculis in oppidum Gades
contulit; eo sex cohortes praesidii causa ex provincia misit
Gaiumque Gallonium, equitem Romanum, familiarem Domitii, qui eo
procurandae hereditatis causa venerat missus a Domitio, oppido
Gadibus praefecit; arma omnia privata ac publica in domum Gallonii
contulit.  Ipse habuit graves in Caesarem contiones.  Saepe ex
tribunali praedicavit adversa Caesarem proelia fecisse, magnum
numerum ab eo militum ad Afranium perfugisse: haec se certis
nuntiis, certis auctoribus comperisse.  Quibus rebus perterritos
cives Romanos eius provinciae sibi ad rem publicam administrandam
HS CCXXX et argenti pondo XX milia, tritici modium CXX milia
polliceri coegit.


He held a levy of the entire province, and added around 30 cohorts
of auxiliary cavalry to his two full legions.  He gathered a great
supply of provisions to send to the Massilians, and to Afranius
and Petreius as well.  He ordered the Gaditanes to build 10
galleys, and arranged the building of many others at Hispalis.  He
carried off all the money and trappings from the temple of
Hercules to the town of Gades; he despatched a garrison of six
cohorts to it from the province.  He put Gaius Gallonius, a Roman
knight of Domitius' household, who had come to him from Domitius,
sent to look after his inheritance, in charge of the town.  He
collected all the arms, public and private, in the house of
Gallonius.  He made harsh speeches against Caesar.  From his
tribunal he often proclaimed that Caesar had lost battles, and
that a great number of his soldiers had deserted to Afranius: that
he'd learned these things from reliable messengers and
authorities.  Through these things he compelled the terrified
Roman citizens of his province to promise him for the republic the
control of 230 sesterces, 20,000 of silver by weight, and 120,000
pecks of wheat.


8.2 Quas Caesari esse amicas civitates arbitrabatur,
his graviora onera iniungebat praesidiaque eo deducebat
et iudicia in privatos reddebat
qui verba atque orationem adversus rem publicam habuissent:
eorum bona in publicum addicebat,
Provinciam omnem in sua et Pompei verba iusiurandum adigebat.

Cognitis eis rebus, quae sunt gestae in citeriore Hispania, bellum parabat.

Ratio autem haec erat belli,
ut se cum II legionibus Gades conferret,
naves frumentumque omne ibi contineret;
provinciam enim omnem Caesaris rebus favere cognoverat.

In insula frumento navibusque comparatis bellum duci non difficile existimabat.

Caesar, etsi multis necessariisque rebus in Italiam revocabatur,
tamen constituerat nullam partem belli in Hispaniis relinquere,
quod magna esse Pompei beneficia
et magnas clientelas in citeriore provincia sciebat.


It was thought that these cities were friends to Caesar,
he imposed heavier burdens on them and removed garrisons from them
and rendered judgments against private men
who had held words and speech against the republic:
he adjudged their words against the public,
he forced the whole province to swear an oath following his and Pompey's words.

After learning of what had happened in nearer Spain, he readied for war.

But the plan was of war,
for Gades to collect 2 legions,
with each one securing ships and supplies there;
for he understood through the thing to support the whole province of Caesar.

As supplies and ships had been readied on the island,
he thought that it wouldn't be hard to conduct a war.

Caesar, even as he was being called back to Italy by many needs and by
the thing, 
nevertheless resolved to leave no part of the war in Spain,
because he knew that Pompey had a great deal of help
and great allies on the near side of the province.
