18.1

Delectum habuit tota provincia,
legionibus completis duabus cohortes circiter XXX alarias addidit.

Frumenti magnum numerum coegit,
quod Massiliensibus, item quod Afranio Petreioque mitteret.

Naves longas X Gaditanis ut facerent imperavit,
complures praeterea [in] Hispali faciendas curavit.

Pecuniam omnem omniaque ornamenta ex fano Herculis in oppidum Gades contulit;
eo sex cohortes praesidii causa ex provincia misit Gaiumque Gallonium,
equitem Romanum, familiarem Domitii,
qui eo procurandae hereditatis causa venerat missus a Domitio,
oppido Gadibus praefecit;
arma omnia privata ac publica in domum Gallonii contulit.

Ipse habuit graves in Caesarem contiones.

Saepe ex tribunali praedicavit adversa Caesarem proelia fecisse,
magnum numerum ab eo militum ad Afranium perfugisse:
haec se certis nuntiis,
certis auctoribus comperisse.

Quibus rebus perterritos cives Romanos eius provinciae sibi ad rem publicam
administrandam HS CCXXX et argenti pondo XX milia,
tritici modium CXX milia polliceri coegit.


He held a levy of the entire province,
and added around 30 cohorts of auxiliary cavalry to two full legions.

He gathered a great supply of provisions
to send to the Massilians, and to Afranius and Petreius as well.

He ordered the Gaditanes to make 10 galleys,
and arranged the building of many others in Spain.

He collected all this money and equipment from the temple of Hercules in the
town of Gades;
he sent him/it six cohorts for a garrison from the province as well as Gaius
Gallonius, a Roman knight of Domitius' household,
who had come to him from Domitius, sent to look after his inheritance.

He put the Gaditanes in charge of the town;
he collected all the arms, public and private, in the house of Gallonius.

He made ponderous speeches against Caesar.

From his tribunal he often proclaimed that Caesar had waged hostile battles,
that a great number of soldiers had deserted from him to Afranius:
that he'd learned these things from reliable messengers and authorities.

Through these things he forced the terrified Roman citizens of his province
to promise him for the republic the control of 
230 sesterces and 20,000 of silver by weight, 120,000 pecks of wheat.
