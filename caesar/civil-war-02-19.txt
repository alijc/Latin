19.1 Itaque duabus legionibus missis in ulteriorem Hispaniam cum Q. Cassio,
tribuno plebis,
ipse DC cum equitibus magnis itineribus progreditur edictumque praemittit,
ad quam diem magistratus principesque omnium civitatum sibi esse praesto
Cordubae vellet.

Quo edicto tota provincia pervulgato nulla fuit civitas,
quin ad id tempus partem senatus Cordubam mitteret,
non civis Romanus paulo notior,
quin ad diem conveniret.

Simul ipse Cordubae conventus per se portas Varroni clausit,
custodias vigiliasque in turribus muroque disposuit,
cohortes duas,
quae colonicae appellabantur,
cum eo casu venissent,
tuendi oppidi causa apud se retinuit.

Eisdem diebus Carmonenses,
quae est longe firmissima totius provinciae civitas,
deductis tribus in arcem oppidi cobortibus a Varrone praesidio,
per se cohortes eiecit portasque praeclusit.


And so, after sending two legions sent into further Spain with Q. Cassius,
the tribune of the people,
he advanced with 600 calvarymen in long marches, sending an edict ahead,
setting the day that he wanted the magistrate and leading citizen of every town
to be available to him in Cordova.

In this edict it was made known that the city was not at all the whole
province, 
that had the senate not released part of Cordova at the time,
not a Roman citizen a little well known,
it would not meet on the day.

Meanwhile, after calling an assembly in Cordova, he closed the gates to Varro
and posted guards and watches in the towers and on the wall.
He retained two cohorts, which were called colonial,
who had come to him by chance for the town garrison.

During these days Carmonenses,
which is by far the most loyal of all the cities of the province,
having drawn three cohorts from Varro to the town citadel for a garrison,
of its own accord threw the cohorts out and closed its gates.
