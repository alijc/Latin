19.1 Itaque duabus legionibus missis in ulteriorem Hispaniam cum
Q. Cassio, tribuno plebis, ipse DC cum equitibus magnis itineribus
progreditur edictumque praemittit, ad quam diem magistratus principesque
omnium civitatum sibi esse praesto Cordubae vellet.  Quo edicto tota
provincia pervulgato nulla fuit civitas, quin ad id tempus partem
senatus Cordubam mitteret, non civis Romanus paulo notior, quin ad diem
conveniret.  Simul ipse Cordubae conventus per se portas Varroni
clausit, custodias vigiliasque in turribus muroque disposuit, cohortes
duas, quae colonicae appellabantur, cum eo casu venissent, tuendi oppidi
causa apud se retinuit.  Eisdem diebus Carmonenses, quae est longe
firmissima totius provinciae civitas, deductis tribus in arcem oppidi
cobortibus a Varrone praesidio, per se cohortes eiecit portasque
praeclusit.


And so, after sending two legions sent into further Spain with
Q. Cassius, the tribune of the people, he advanced with 600 calvarymen
in long marches, sending an edict ahead, setting the day that he wanted
the magistrate and leading citizen of every town to be available to him
in Cordova.  When this edict had been communicated, there was not a city
in the whole province that did not send part of their senate to Cordova
at the appointed time, and not a Roman citizen of any note that didn't
meet on that day.  Meanwhile, Cordova's assembly, of its own accord,
closed its gates to Varro and posted guards and watches in the towers
and on the wall.  They retained two cohorts, which were called colonial,
who had come to them by chance for the town garrison.  At the same time
Carmona, which is by far the most powerful of all the cities of the
province, which had drawn three cohorts from Varro to the town citadel
for a garrison, of its own accord threw the cohorts out and closed its
gates.
