19.1 Itaque duabus legionibus missis in ulteriorem Hispaniam cum Q. Cassio,
tribuno plebis,
ipse DC cum equitibus magnis itineribus progreditur edictumque praemittit,
ad quam diem magistratus principesque omnium civitatum sibi esse praesto
Cordubae vellet.

Quo edicto tota provincia pervulgato nulla fuit civitas,
quin ad id tempus partem senatus Cordubam mitteret,
non civis Romanus paulo notior,
quin ad diem conveniret.

Simul ipse Cordubae conventus per se portas Varroni clausit,
custodias vigiliasque in turribus muroque disposuit,
cohortes duas,
quae colonicae appellabantur,
cum eo casu venissent,
tuendi oppidi causa apud se retinuit.

Eisdem diebus Carmonenses,
quae est longe firmissima totius provinciae civitas,
deductis tribus in arcem oppidi cobortibus a Varrone praesidio,
per se cohortes eiecit portasque praeclusit.


And so with two legions sent into further Spain with Q. Cassius,
tribune of the people,
he 600 with calvary great marches advanced and sent an edict ahead,
to which day the magistrate and leading citizen of every town to be to himself
at hand he would wish in Cordova.

By which edict/proclamation (through) the whole province (no) town was made
known,
so that not to id the time might have sent part of the Cordovan senate,
not a Roman citizen a little well known,
so that not at the day he might meet.

At the same time he himself in Cordova met/agreed through himself closed the
gates of Varron???,
>the guards and watches in the towers and wall he posted,
>two cohorts,
which were called colonial,
when they had come by chance,
to protect the town he retained in his presence.

During these days the Carmonenses(F?),
which is distantly the most loyal/staunchest of all the cities of the province,
by/to drawn three cohorts in the citadel of the town from Varronus to/by
garrison,
through self he cast the cohorts and closed the gates.
