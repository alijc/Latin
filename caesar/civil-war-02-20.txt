20.1
Hoc vero magis properare Varro,
ut cum legionibus quam primum Gades contenderet,
ne itinere aut traiectu intercluderetur:
tanta ac tam secunda in Caesarem voluntas provinciae reperiebatur.

Progresso ei paulo longius litterae Gadibus redduntur:
simulatque sit cognitum de edicto Caesaris,
consensisse Gaditanos principes cum tribunis cohortium,
quae essent ibi in praesidio, ut Gallonium ex oppido expellerent,
urbem insulamque Caesari servarent.

Hoc inito consilio denuntiavisse Gallonio,
ut sua sponte, dum sine periculo liceret, excederet Gadibus;
si id non fecisset, sibi consilium capturos.

Hoc timore adductum Gallonium Gadibus excessisse.

His cognitis rebus altera ex duabus legionibus,
quae vernacula appellabatur,
ex castris Varronis adstante et inspectante ipso signa sustulit seseque Hispalim
recepit atque in foro et porticibus sine maleficio consedit.

Quod factum adeo eius conventus cives Romani comprobaverunt,
ut domum ad se quisque hospitio cupidissime reciperet.

Quibus rebus perterritus Varro, cum itinere converso sese Italicam venturum
praemisisset, certior ab suis factus est praeclusas esse portas.

Tum vero omni interclusus itinere ad Caesarem mittit,
paratum se esse legionem, cui iusserit, tradere.

Ille ad eum Sextum Caesarem mittit atque huic tradi iubet.

Tradita legione Varro Cordubam ad Caesarem venit;
relatis ad eum publicis cum fide rationibus
quod penes eum est pecuniae tradit et,
quid ubique habeat frumenti et navium, ostendit.


Indeed due to this Varro hurried all the more,
so that he could get to Gades with his legions first,
before he could be cut off on the road:
so great and so favorable did he find the province's good will towards Caesar to
be. 

After he had marched a short distance he got replies to his letters to Gades:
and as soon as it might be known from Caesar's edict ,
that the leaders of the Gadeans had joined with the tribunes of the cohortes
that were posted there to drive Gallonius out of the town,
>city and island to Caesar they might protect/save.

After they made this decision they announced it to Gallonius
and allowed him, of his own free will, to withdraw from Gades without fear of
attack; 
if it was not done, to self the plan the town about to be seized.

by this fear having brought Gallonius to have withdrawn from Gades.

After learning of these matters from the two legions called 'domestic',
out of Varro's Camp standing/assisting and observing by himself standards it/he
raised self and
retook Hispal??? with no casualties and bivouacked in its market place and
porches. 

that/because deed to such a point (of?) his agreement/assembly the Roman
citizens approved,
so that >house to self and anyone to/by hospitality most eagerly he received.

Varro, these things having thoroughly frightened, with an altered march
sent himself ahead about to come to Italy,
after his men assured him that the gates were shut.

Then truly to/by each the blockade to/by the road/march to Caesar he sent word
that he had readied the legion that he'd been ordered to deliver.

He sent Sextus Caesar to him and ordered to this to be handed over.

After surrendering the legion Varro came to Caesar in Corduba;
the public accounts have bveen given to him in trust
that/because belonging to him it was of money he handed over and,
what where and he had supplies and ships he showed.
