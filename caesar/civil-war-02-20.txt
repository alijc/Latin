20.1
Hoc vero magis properare Varro,
ut cum legionibus quam primum Gades contenderet,
ne itinere aut traiectu intercluderetur:
tanta ac tam secunda in Caesarem voluntas provinciae reperiebatur.

Progresso ei paulo longius litterae Gadibus redduntur:
simulatque sit cognitum de edicto Caesaris,
consensisse Gaditanos principes cum tribunis cohortium,
quae essent ibi in praesidio, ut Gallonium ex oppido expellerent,
urbem insulamque Caesari servarent.

Hoc inito consilio denuntiavisse Gallonio,
ut sua sponte, dum sine periculo liceret, excederet Gadibus;
si id non fecisset, sibi consilium capturos.

Hoc timore adductum Gallonium Gadibus excessisse.

His cognitis rebus altera ex duabus legionibus,
quae vernacula appellabatur,
ex castris Varronis adstante et inspectante ipso signa sustulit seseque Hispalim
recepit atque in foro et porticibus sine maleficio consedit.

Quod factum adeo eius conventus cives Romani comprobaverunt,
ut domum ad se quisque hospitio cupidissime reciperet.

Quibus rebus perterritus Varro, cum itinere converso sese Italicam venturum
praemisisset, certior ab suis factus est praeclusas esse portas.

Tum vero omni interclusus itinere ad Caesarem mittit,
paratum se esse legionem, cui iusserit, tradere.

Ille ad eum Sextum Caesarem mittit atque huic tradi iubet.

Tradita legione Varro Cordubam ad Caesarem venit;
relatis ad eum publicis cum fide rationibus
quod penes eum est pecuniae tradit et,
quid ubique habeat frumenti et navium, ostendit.


Indeed due to this Varro hurried all the more,
so that he and his legions could reach Gades first,
before he could be cut off on the road:
so great and so favorable did he find the province's good will towards Caesar. 

After he had marched a short distance he got a reply to his letter to Gades:
no sooner had he found out about Caesar's edict,
that the leaders of the Gadeans had joined up with the tribunes of the cohortes
that were posted there to drive Gallonius out of the town,
to keep the city and island for Caesar.

After they made this decision they announced it to Gallonius
and allowed him, of his own free will, to withdraw from Gades without fear of
attack;
if he didn't do this, their plan was to capture him.

Because of this fear Gallonius was brought to withdraw from Gades.

After learning of these matters one of the two legions called 'domestic',
stationed and observing out of Varro's camp,
by him(self) raised the standards and 
retook Hispalis with no casualties, and bivouacked in its market place and
porches. 

Since the Roman citizens approved the creation of the assembly so much, 
anyone connected to it recieved lodging with the utmost hospitality.

Varro, thoroughly frightened by these matters,
with an altered march
sent himself ahead about to come to Italy,
after his men assured him that the gates were shut.

Then truly blocked on every road, he sent word to Caesar
that he was prepared to surrender his legion, as he'd been ordered.

He sent Sextus Caesar to him and ordered him to be handed over to him.

After surrendering the legion Varro came to Caesar in Corduba;
bringing the public accounts that he'd held in trust,
handed over what money belonged to him,
and showed him what he had in the way of supplies and ships.
