21.1 Caesar contione habita Cordubae omnibus generatim gratias agit:
civibus Romanis, quod oppidum in sua potestate studuissent habere;
Hispanis, quod praesidia expulissent; Gaditanis, quod conatus
adversariorum infregissent seseque in libertatem vindicassent;
tribunis militum centurionibusque, qui eo praesidii causa venerant,
quod eorum consilia sua virtute confirmassent.  Pecunias, quas erant
in publicum Varroni cives Romani polliciti, remittit; bona restituit
eis, quos liberius locutos hanc poenam tulisse cognoverat.  Tributis
quibusdam populis publicis privatisque praemiis reliquos in posterum
bona spe complet biduumque Cordubae commoratus Gades proficiscitur;
pecunias monumentaque, quae ex fano Herculis collata erant in
privatam domum, referri in templum iubet.  Provinciae Q. Cassium
praeficit; huic III legiones attribuit.  Ipse eis navibus, quas
M. Varro quasque Gaditani iussu Varronis fecerant, Tarraconem paucis
diebus pervenit.  Ibi totius fere citerioris provinciae legationes
Caesaris adventum exspectabant.  Eadem ratione privatim ac publice
quibusdam civitatibus habitis honoribus Tarracone discedit
pedibusque Narbonem atque inde Massiliam pervenit.  Ibi legem de
dictatore latam seseque dictatorem dictum a M. Lepido praetore
cognoscit.


Caesar held a meeting in Cordova and gave thanks to all and sundry:
to the Roman citizens, because they had taken pains to hold their
town in their own power; to the Spaniards, because they had driven
the garrison out; to the Gadians, because they had overcome the
efforts of their adversaries and had claimed their own liberty; to
the military tribunes and centurions who had come to his defense,
because they had confirmed their plans with courage.  He returned
the money that the Roman citizens had publicly promised to Varro; he
restored their goods to those whom he found out had born the penalty
of speaking too freely.  After distributing certain public and
private rewards he satisfied the rest with good hope for the future,
and set out for Gades and after staying in Cordova for two days; he
ordered that the money and monuments that had been moved from the
shrine of Hercules to a private house should be returned to the
temple.  He placed Q. Cassius in command of the province; he
assigned 3 legions to him.  He himself arrived at Tarraco few days
later, using the ships that M. Varro and the Gadians had built at
Varro's command.  Nearly all the legions of the near side of the
province were waiting for Caesar's arrival there.  In the same way,
after granting honors to certain cities in private and in public, he
departed Tarraco on foot and came to Massilia by way of Narbo.
There he learned of a law that had been proposed by the praetor
M. Lepidus that declared him dictator.
