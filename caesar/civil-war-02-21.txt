21.1 Caesar contione habita Cordubae omnibus generatim gratias agit:
civibus Romanis, quod oppidum in sua potestate studuissent habere;
Hispanis, quod praesidia expulissent;
Gaditanis, quod conatus adversariorum infregissent seseque in libertatem
vindicassent;
tribunis militum centurionibusque, qui eo praesidii causa venerant,
quod eorum consilia sua virtute confirmassent.

Pecunias, quas erant in publicum Varroni cives Romani polliciti, remittit;
bona restituit eis, quos liberius locutos hanc poenam tulisse cognoverat.

Tributis quibusdam populis publicis privatisque praemiis reliquos in posterum
bona spe complet biduumque Cordubae commoratus Gades proficiscitur;
pecunias monumentaque, quae ex fano Herculis collata erant in privatam domum,
referri in templum iubet.

Provinciae Q. Cassium praeficit; huic III legiones attribuit.

Ipse eis navibus, quas M. Varro quasque Gaditani iussu Varronis fecerant,
Tarraconem paucis diebus pervenit.

Ibi totius fere citerioris provinciae legationes Caesaris adventum exspectabant.

Eadem ratione privatim ac publice quibusdam civitatibus habitis honoribus
 Tarracone discedit pedibusque Narbonem atque inde Massiliam pervenit.

Ibi legem de dictatore latam seseque dictatorem dictum a M. Lepido praetore
cognoscit.


Caesar, having held a meeting, in Cordova gave thanks to all and sundry:
to the Roman citizens, because they had desired to hold their town in their own
power;
to the Spaniards, because they had driven the garrison out;
to the Gadians, because they had overcome the efforts of their adversaries and
had avenged themselves into liberty;
to the military tribunes and centurions, who had come to protect him,
because their counsel had proved their own courage.

He sent back the money that Varro publicly had promised to the Roman citizens;
he restored their goods to those whom he found out had born this penalty freely.

having divided certain things to the publis and private people to/by rewards
>the rest of the men in future
with good hope he completes and two days in Cordova having stayed he sets out
for Gades;
>moneys and records, which out of the shrine of Hercules had been collected into
a private house, he ordered to be returned to the temple.

He placed Q. Cassius in command of the province; he assigned 3 legions to him.

He to/by the ships, that M. Varro and which the Gadians had built at Varro's
command,
arrived at Tarracone after a few days.

There of nearly all the legions of the near side of the province were
waiting for Caesar's arrival.

at the same time to/by the account in private and in public,
certain cities having held respect/regard,
Tarracone withdraws and on foot >Narbone and from there comes to Massilia.

There the learned of a law brought/wide about dictator and self >dictator said
by the praetor M. Lepidus.
