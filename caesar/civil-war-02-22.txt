22.1 Massilienses omnibus defessi malis, rei frumentariae ad summam
inopiam adducti, bis navali proelio superati, crebris eruptionibus
fusi, gravi etiam pestilentia conflictati ex diutina conclusione et
mutatione victus (panico enim vetere atque hordeo corrupto omnes
alebantur, quod ad huiusmodi casus antiquitus paratum in publicum
contulerant) deiecta turri, labefacta magna parte muri, auxiliis
provinciarum et exercituum desperatis, quos in Caesaris potestatem
venisse cognoverant, sese dedere sine fraude constituunt.  Sed
paucis ante diebus L. Domitius cognita Massiliensium voluntate
navibus III comparatis, ex quibus duas familiaribus suis
attribuerat, unam ipse conscenderat nactus turbidam tempestatem
profectus est.  Hunc conspicatae naves, quae iussu Bruti
consuetudine cotidiana ad portum excubabant, sublatis ancoris sequi
coeperunt.  Ex his unum ipsius navigium contendit et fugere
perseveravit auxilioque tempestatis ex conspectu abiit, duo
perterrita concursu nostrarum navium sese in portum receperunt.
Massilienses arma tormentaque ex oppido, ut est imperatum,
proferunt, naves ex portu navalibusque educunt, pecuniam ex publico
tradunt.  Quibus rebus confectis Caesar magis eos pro nomine et
vetustate, quam pro meritis in se civitatis conservans duas ibi
legiones praesidio relinquit, ceteras in Italiam mittit; ipse ad
urbem proficiscitur.


The Massilians had grown weary by all the bad things that had
happened, having used up their supplies, been bested twice in naval
battles, frequently routed in sorties, and also tormented with a
grave illness brought on by a long seige and a change of diet (for
they were all fed on stale millet and rotten barley, that they had
collected in the public treasury in case of such a calamity) and by
the destruction of the tower and the undermining of a large part of
the wall, having lost hope in help from the provinces or armies
when they learned that they'd fallen under Caesar's power, and they
resolved to give themselves up without deceit.  But L. Domitius
found out about this desire of the Massilians a few days
beforehand, and assembled 3 ships, assigning two of these to his
household and himself boarding the third, embarked in the middle of
a storm.  But Brutus' ships, which he had ordered to keep a
constant watch on the harbor, sighted him, and they raised anchor
and commenced a pursuit.  Domitius' own vessel broke away and
continued its flight, and passed out of sight with the aid of the
storm, the other two were scared off by the encounter with our
ships and retreated back into the harbor.  The Massilians brought
their arms and catapults out of the town, as had been ordered,
withdrew their ships from the harbor and docks, and surrendered the
money from the public treasury.  When these things had been
completed, Caesar sparing the city, more on account of its fame and
antiquity than for any merit of the city itself, left two legions
there as a garrison and sent the rest to Italy; he himself
proceeded to Rome.
