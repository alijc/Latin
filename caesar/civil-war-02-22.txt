22.1 Massilienses omnibus defessi malis,
rei frumentariae ad summam inopiam adducti,
bis navali proelio superati, crebris eruptionibus fusi,
gravi etiam pestilentia conflictati ex diutina conclusione
et mutatione victus
(panico enim vetere atque hordeo corrupto omnes alebantur,
quod ad huiusmodi casus antiquitus paratum in publicum contulerant)
deiecta turri, labefacta magna parte muri,
auxiliis provinciarum et exercituum desperatis,
quos in Caesaris potestatem venisse cognoverant,
sese dedere sine fraude constituunt.

Sed paucis ante diebus L. Domitius cognita Massiliensium voluntate navibus III
comparatis,
ex quibus duas familiaribus suis attribuerat,
unam ipse conscenderat nactus turbidam tempestatem profectus est.

Hunc conspicatae naves,
quae iussu Bruti consuetudine cotidiana ad portum excubabant,
sublatis ancoris sequi coeperunt.

Ex his unum ipsius navigium contendit
et fugere perseveravit auxilioque tempestatis ex conspectu abiit,
duo perterrita concursu nostrarum navium sese in portum receperunt.

Massilienses arma tormentaque ex oppido,
ut est imperatum, proferunt,
naves ex portu navalibusque educunt,
pecuniam ex publico tradunt.

Quibus rebus confectis Caesar magis eos pro nomine et vetustate,
quam pro meritis in se civitatis conservans duas ibi legiones praesidio
relinquit, ceteras in Italiam mittit;
ipse ad urbem proficiscitur.


The Massilians had grown weary by all the bad things that had happened,
having used up their supplies, been bested twice in naval battles,
frequently routed in sorties,
and also tormented with a grave illness brought on by a long seige and a change of diet
(for everyone was fed on stale millet and rotten barley,
because in accord with ancient custom they had
amassed their provisions in common) and
by the destruction of the tower and the undermining of a large part of the wall,
the desperate provincial and regular auxiliaries,
whom against Caesar's power they had learned to have come,
resolved to give themselves up without deceit.

But L. Domitius found out about this desire of the Massilians
 a few days beforehand, and assembled 3 ships, assigning two of these to
 his household and himself boarding the third, embarked in the middle of a storm.

But the ships were sighted,
since our men were keeping a constant watch on the harbor, by order of Brutus,
and they raised anchor and commenced to persue him.

One of his vessels broke away and continued its flight, and passed out of sight
with the aid of the storm,
the other two were scared off by the encounter with our ships and retreated back
into the harbor. 

The Massilians brought their arms and catapults out of the town, as had been
ordered, withdrew their ships from the harbor and docks,
and surrendered money out of the public (treasury?).

When these things had been completed, Caesar, more for their name and antiguity
than for merit in themselves of the city preserving,
left two legions there as a garrison and sent the rest to Italy;
he himself proceeded to the city (Rome?).
