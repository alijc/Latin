22.1 Massilienses omnibus defessi malis,
rei frumentariae ad summam inopiam adducti,
bis navali proelio superati, crebris eruptionibus fusi,
gravi etiam pestilentia conflictati ex diutina conclusione
et mutatione victus
(panico enim vetere atque hordeo corrupto omnes alebantur,
quod ad huiusmodi casus antiquitus paratum in publicum contulerant)
deiecta turri, labefacta magna parte muri,
auxiliis provinciarum et exercituum desperatis,
quos in Caesaris potestatem venisse cognoverant,
sese dedere sine fraude constituunt.

Sed paucis ante diebus L. Domitius cognita Massiliensium voluntate navibus III
comparatis,
ex quibus duas familiaribus suis attribuerat,
unam ipse conscenderat nactus turbidam tempestatem profectus est.

Hunc conspicatae naves,
quae iussu Bruti consuetudine cotidiana ad portum excubabant,
sublatis ancoris sequi coeperunt.

Ex his unum ipsius navigium contendit
et fugere perseveravit auxilioque tempestatis ex conspectu abiit,
duo perterrita concursu nostrarum navium sese in portum receperunt.

Massilienses arma tormentaque ex oppido,
ut est imperatum, proferunt,
naves ex portu navalibusque educunt,
pecuniam ex publico tradunt.

Quibus rebus confectis Caesar magis eos pro nomine et vetustate,
quam pro meritis in se civitatis conservans duas ibi legiones praesidio
relinquit, ceteras in Italiam mittit;
ipse ad urbem proficiscitur.


The Massilians to/by all evils having grown weary,
of supply to the utmost need having been led up,
two times in naval battles overcom, with frequent sorties routed,
with a yet heavy fever tormented from a long seige and a change of diet
(for to/by stale millet and rotten barley everyone was fed,
that/because to this sort the old plight in public they had
brought/discussed/opposed  prepared)
by the destruction of the tower, the undermining of a large part of the wall,
by the desperate provincial and regular auxiliaries,
whom against Caesar's power they had learned to have come,
resolved to give themselves up without deceit.

But a few days before L. Domitius having learned the desire of the Massilians
with 3 ships provided,
out of which >two to/by his household he had assigned,
>one he himself had boarded, having obtained stormy weather embarked.

>this one the sighted ships,
which on the order of Brutus by/to daily habit to the harbor they were keeping
watch,
having raised achors they commenced to persue.

out of these one of his vessels strove/stretched
and to flee continued and by/to the aid of the weather passed out of sight,
two terrified by the encounter with our ships retreated back into the harbor.

The Massilians brought their arms and catapults out of the town, as had been
ordered, withdrew their ships from the harbor and docks,
surrendered money out of the public (treasury?).

which things having been completed, Caesar to a greater extent, >them for name
and antiguity,
than for merit in themselves of the city preserving left two legions there as a
garrison, sent the rest to Italy;
himself proceeded to the city (Rome?).
