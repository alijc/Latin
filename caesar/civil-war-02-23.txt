23.1 Eisdem temporibus C. Curio in Africam profectus ex Sicilia et
iam ab initio copias P. Attii Vari despiciens duas legiones ex IIII,
quas a Caesare acceperat,
D equites transportabat biduoque et noctibus tribus navigatione consumptis
appellit ad eum locum,
qui appellatur Anquillaria.

Hic locus abest a Clupeis passuum XXII milia habetque non incommodam aestate
stationem et duobus eminentibus promuntoriis continetur.

Huius adventum L. Caesar filius cum X longis navibus ad Clupea praestolans,
quas naves Uticae ex praedonum bello subductas P. Attius reficiendas huius belli
causa curaverat,
veritus navium multitudinem ex alto refugerat appulsaque ad proximum litus
trireme constrata et in litore relicta pedibus Adrumetum perfugerat.

Id oppidum C. Considius Longus unius legionis praesidio tuebatur.

Reliquae Caesaris naves <cognita> eius fuga se Adrumetum receperunt.

Hunc secutus Marcius Rufus quaestor navibus XII,
quas praesidio onerariis navibus Curio ex Sicilia eduxerat,
postquam in litore relictam navem conspexit,
hanc remulco abstraxit;
ipse ad C. Curionem cum classe redit.


In the meantime, C. Curio had advanced from Sicily to Africa and,
from the very start thinking little of two legions from the 4 of P. Attius
Varius' troops, that he'd received from Caesar,
was transporting 500 horsemen and, after spending two days and three nights in
the voyage he put ashore at the place called Anquillaria.

This place is 12 miles away from Clupeis and contains an outpost that's not too
bad in the summer and is protected by two prominent headlands.
A son, L. Caesar, was awaiting his arrival with with 10 gallerys at Clupea.

P. Attius had transferred these Utican ships from the war on the pirates and
had undertaken their repair for this war.

For fear of these ships, he had fled the crowd from the height/sea
and put in at the nearest shore in a decked trieme,
which he's abandoned on the shore and fled on foot for refuge in Adrumetus.

C. Considius Longus defended this town with a garrison of a single legion.

When they found out about this flight, the rest of Caesar's ships betook
themselves to Adrumetus.

Quaestor Marcius Rufus followed him with 7 ships,
that Curio had ordered out to sea from Sicily to protect our freight ships.

After he spied ship abandoned on the shore,
he pulled it off with a tow-rope;
he returned to C. Curio with the fleet.
