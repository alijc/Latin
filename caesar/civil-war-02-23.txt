23.1 Eisdem temporibus C. Curio in Africam profectus ex Sicilia et
iam ab initio copias P. Attii Vari despiciens duas legiones ex IIII,
quas a Caesare acceperat,
D equites transportabat biduoque et noctibus tribus navigatione consumptis
appellit ad eum locum,
qui appellatur Anquillaria.

Hic locus abest a Clupeis passuum XXII milia habetque non incommodam aestate
stationem et duobus eminentibus promuntoriis continetur.

Huius adventum L. Caesar filius cum X longis navibus ad Clupea praestolans,
quas naves Uticae ex praedonum bello subductas P. Attius reficiendas huius belli
causa curaverat,
veritus navium multitudinem ex alto refugerat appulsaque ad proximum litus
trireme constrata et in litore relicta pedibus Adrumetum perfugerat.

Id oppidum C. Considius Longus unius legionis praesidio tuebatur.

Reliquae Caesaris naves <cognita> eius fuga se Adrumetum receperunt.

Hunc secutus Marcius Rufus quaestor navibus XII,
quas praesidio onerariis navibus Curio ex Sicilia eduxerat,
postquam in litore relictam navem conspexit,
hanc remulco abstraxit;
ipse ad C. Curionem cum classe redit.

the sea journey he put ashore at the place called Anquillaria.

This place is 12 miles away from Clupeis and has not inconvenient in
weather/summer outpost and is protected by two prominent headlands.

The arrival of this one L. Caesar the son with 10 gallerys at Clupea standing
ready for,
>which ships of Utica out of the war on the pirates had been transferred
P. Attius for their rebuilding/repair for the sake of this war had undertaken,
dread of the ships >multitude from the height/sea he had fled
and a decked trieme landed at the nearest shore
an the shore abandoned on foot had taken refuge in Adrumetus.

It the town C. Considius Longus protected one of the legions as a garrison.

The rest of Caesar's ships, the flight having become known, betook themselves to
Adrumetus.

>this having followed queastor Marcius Rufus with 7 ships,
>which as protection for the freight ships Curio our of Sicily led out,
after he spied an abandoned ship on the shore,
he dragged it off with a tow-rope;
he to C. Curio with the fleet returned.
