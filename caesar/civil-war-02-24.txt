24.1 Curio Marcium Uticam navibus praemittit; ipse eodem cum
exercitu proficiscitur biduique iter progressus ad flumen Bagradam
pervenit.  Ibi C. Caninium Rebilum legatum cum legionibus reliquit;
ipse cum equitatu antecedit ad castra exploranda Cornelia, quod is
locus peridoneus castris habebatur.  Id autem est iugum directum
eminens in mare, utraque ex parte praeruptum atque asperum, sed
tamen paulo leniore fastigio ab ea parte, quae ad Uticam vergit.
Abest directo itinere ab Utica paulo amplius passuum milibus III.
Sed hoc itinere est fons, quo mare succedit longius, lateque is
locus restagnat; quem si qui vitare voluerit, sex milium circuitu
in oppidum pervenit.


Curio sent the ships ahead to Utica with Marcius, while he himself
set out with the army for the same place and, after a two-day
march, reached the River Bagrada.  Leaving the legate C. Caninius
Rebilus with some legions there, he led the army out to scout out
Cornelius' camp, because this spot was held to be very suitable for
a camp.  For it's on a prominent ridge rises straight out of the
sea, with both sides steep and rugged, but a bit easier on the side
that slopes towards Utica.  It's a bit more than 3 miles away from
Utica as the bird flies, But there's a spring on this route that
flows down to the sea, and this spot is flooded far and wide.  If
one wishes to avoid it, it means a six mile detour to get to the
town.
