24.1 Curio Marcium Uticam navibus praemittit;
ipse eodem cum exercitu proficiscitur biduique iter progressus ad flumen
Bagradam pervenit.

Ibi C. Caninium Rebilum legatum cum legionibus reliquit;
ipse cum equitatu antecedit ad castra exploranda Cornelia,
quod is locus peridoneus castris habebatur.

Id autem est iugum directum eminens in mare,
utraque ex parte praeruptum atque asperum,
sed tamen paulo leniore fastigio ab ea parte,
quae ad Uticam vergit.

Abest directo itinere ab Utica paulo amplius passuum milibus III.

Sed hoc itinere est fons,
quo mare succedit longius,
lateque is locus restagnat;
quem si qui vitare voluerit,
sex milium circuitu in oppidum pervenit.


Curio sent Marcius ahead to Utica with ships;
he himself set out for the same place with an army and after a two-day march
he reached the River Bagrada.

He left the legate C. Caninius Rebilus with the legions there;
he himself with the army preceded to the camp for searching out with Cornelia,
because/that this place very suitable for a camp was held to be.

But there is a prominent steep ridge in the sea,
both steep and rugged from the side(?),
but still a bit gentler than the slope from the side(?)
that slopes towards Utica.

the direct route is away from Utica a bit more than 3 miles.

But there is a spring on this route,
by which the sea climbs longer,
and broadly this place is flooded;
but if whoever to avoid might be willing,
six mile detour he comes to the town.
