25.1 Hoc explorato loco Curio castra Vari conspicit
muro oppidoque coniuncta ad portam,
quae appellatur Belica, admodum munita natura loci,
una ex parte ipso oppido Utica, altera [a] theatro, quod est ante oppidum,
substructionibus eius operis maximis, aditu ad castra difficili et angusto.

Simul animadvertit multa undique portari atque agi plenissimis viis,
quae repentini tumultus timore ex agris in urbem conferantur.

Huc equitatum mittit, ut diriperet atque haberet loco praedae;
eodemque tempore his rebus subsidio DC Numidae ex oppido
peditesque CCCC mittuntur a Varo,
quos auxilii causa rex Iuba paucis diebus ante Uticam miserat.

Huic et paternum hospitium cum Pompeio et simultas cum Curione intercedebat,
quod tribunus plebis legem promulgaverat,
qua lege regnum Iubae publicaverat.

Concurrunt equites inter se;
neque vero primum impetum nostrorum Numidae ferre potuerunt,
sed interfectis circiter CXX reliqui se in castra ad oppidum receperunt.

Interim adventu longarum navium Curio pronuntiare onerariis navibus iubet,
quae stabant ad Uticam numero circiter CC,
se in hostium habiturum loco,
qui non e vestigio ad castra Cornelia naves traduxisset.

Qua pronuntiatione facta temporis puncto sublatis ancoris omnes Uticam
 relinquunt et quo imperatum est transeunt.

Quae res omnium rerum copia complevit exercitum.


After reconnoitering this location, Curio observed Varius' camp,
which was connected to the town wall at a gate named Belica.
This spot has highly defensible nature,
with Utica itself on one side and the theater that fronts the town on the other,
with foundations that make the best fortifications,
leave only a difficult and confined approach to the camp.
At the same time he observed that much was being carried and driven from all
parts along crowded roads,
which were being collected from the fields to the city
due to the fear of unexpected tumults.
He sent cavalry there, to pillage and plunder the place.
At the same time Varius sent Numidian reinforcements from the town,
600 horse and 400 infantry that King Juba had sent to Utica a few days
before to assist them.

He was interceding with both Pompey (here with fatherly hospitality) and with
Curio, 
because the tribune of the people had proclaimed a law,
through which he had confiscated the kingdom of Juba.

The two cavalries charged each other;
and indeed the Numidians couldn't withstand our initial assault.
After about 120 were killed, the rest retreated to the camp at the town.

In the meantime, upon the arrival of the galleys
Curio commanded with the cargo ships, of which about 200 lay at Utica, to be
announced,
that those of the enemy should be held in a spot,
who had not convoyed the ships over from the path to the Cornelian camp.

After this proclamation was made
at a point of time
everyone raised anchor and left Utica and, as commanded, crossed over.

And, all in all, he filled out his army with these troops
