25.1 Hoc explorato loco Curio castra Vari conspicit
muro oppidoque coniuncta ad portam,
quae appellatur Belica, admodum munita natura loci,
una ex parte ipso oppido Utica, altera [a] theatro, quod est ante oppidum,
substructionibus eius operis maximis, aditu ad castra difficili et angusto.

Simul animadvertit multa undique portari atque agi plenissimis viis,
quae repentini tumultus timore ex agris in urbem conferantur.

Huc equitatum mittit, ut diriperet atque haberet loco praedae;
eodemque tempore his rebus subsidio DC Numidae ex oppido
peditesque CCCC mittuntur a Varo,
quos auxilii causa rex Iuba paucis diebus ante Uticam miserat.

Huic et paternum hospitium cum Pompeio et simultas cum Curione intercedebat,
quod tribunus plebis legem promulgaverat,
qua lege regnum Iubae publicaverat.

Concurrunt equites inter se;
neque vero primum impetum nostrorum Numidae ferre potuerunt,
sed interfectis circiter CXX reliqui se in castra ad oppidum receperunt.

Interim adventu longarum navium Curio pronuntiare onerariis navibus iubet,
quae stabant ad Uticam numero circiter CC,
se in hostium habiturum loco,
qui non e vestigio ad castra Cornelia naves traduxisset.

Qua pronuntiatione facta temporis puncto sublatis ancoris omnes Uticam
 relinquunt et quo imperatum est transeunt.

Quae res omnium rerum copia complevit exercitum.


this spot having been reconnoitered, Curio observed Varius' camp
to/by wall and town connected to the gate,
which (gate) was called Belica, the highly defensible nature of the spot,
on one of side by Utica itself, and the other by the theater,
which is in front of the town,
to/by its foundations the greatest works/fortifications ,
by a difficult and confined approach to the camp.

Meanwhile, he observed many things everywhere to be carried and driven along
very full roads, which things sudden commotions to/by dread from the fields into
the city were being brought together.

to this place he sent cavalry, to pillage and have plunder to/by the place;
at the same time to/by these things to/by reinforcement 600 Numians? from the
town and 400 foot were sent by Varus,
>which men for the sake of assistance King Juba had sent to Utica a few days
before.

to this and father's hospitality/inn with Pompey and rivalry with Curio was
coming between/hindering,
because/what the tribune of the people >law had proclaimed,
by which law he had published/confiscated the kingdom of Juba.

the cavalry assembled among themselves;
and truly the Numidians? couldn't bear >the first charge of our men,
but aound 120 having been killed, the rest retreated to camp at the town.

In the meantime by the arrival of the galleys Curio to announce to/by cargo
ships he commanded,
which were standing at Utica about 200 in number,
selves in a spot of the enemy about to hold,
who not out of step to the Cornelian camp the ships he lead across.

by which proclamation becoming known/done of the time/season/condition to/by the
point having raised anchor all left Utica and by which was commanded, they
crossed.

which thing of all things the supplies/troops he filled up the army.
