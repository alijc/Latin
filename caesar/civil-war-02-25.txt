25.1 Hoc explorato loco Curio castra Vari conspicit muro oppidoque
coniuncta ad portam, quae appellatur Belica, admodum munita natura
loci, una ex parte ipso oppido Utica, altera [a] theatro, quod est
ante oppidum, substructionibus eius operis maximis, aditu ad castra
difficili et angusto.  Simul animadvertit multa undique portari atque
agi plenissimis viis, quae repentini tumultus timore ex agris in urbem
conferantur.  Huc equitatum mittit, ut diriperet atque haberet loco
praedae; eodemque tempore his rebus subsidio DC Numidae ex oppido
peditesque CCCC mittuntur a Varo, quos auxilii causa rex Iuba paucis
diebus ante Uticam miserat.  Huic et paternum hospitium cum Pompeio et
simultas cum Curione intercedebat, quod tribunus plebis legem
promulgaverat, qua lege regnum Iubae publicaverat.  Concurrunt equites
inter se; neque vero primum impetum nostrorum Numidae ferre potuerunt,
sed interfectis circiter CXX reliqui se in castra ad oppidum
receperunt.  Interim adventu longarum navium Curio pronuntiare
onerariis navibus iubet, quae stabant ad Uticam numero circiter CC, se
in hostium habiturum loco, qui non e vestigio ad castra Cornelia naves
traduxisset.  Qua pronuntiatione facta temporis puncto sublatis
ancoris omnes Uticam relinquunt et quo imperatum est transeunt.  Quae
res omnium rerum copia complevit exercitum.


After reconnoitering this location, Curio observed Varus' camp, which
was connected to the town wall at a gate named Belica.  This spot had
a highly defensible nature, with Utica itself on one side and the
theater that fronts the town on the other, with foundations that made
very good fortifications, leaving only a difficult and confined
approach to the camp.  At the same time he observed that people from
everywhere were crowding the roads, carrying and driving their
property into the city, gathering it from the fields around for fear
of unexpected tumults.  He sent cavalry there, to pillage and plunder
the place.  At the same time Varus sent Numidian reinforcements from
the town to assist them, 600 horse and 400 infantry that King Juba had
sent to Utica a few days before.  Juba held both a fatherly
hospitality towards Pompey and hostility towards Curio, because as
tribune of the people had proclaimed a law that had confiscated the
kingdom of Juba.  The two cavalries charged each other, and the
Numidians couldn't withstand our initial assault at all.  After about
120 were killed, the rest retreated to the camp at the town.  In the
meantime, upon the arrival of the galleys, Curio ordered it to be
announced to the cargo ships, of which about 200 lay at Utica, that
anyone didn't immediately convoy his ship to the Cornelian camp would
be held to belong to the enemy.  After this proclamation was made
everyone raised anchor at one and left Utica and crossed over as
commanded.  In this way he supplied his army with all sorts of
supplies.
