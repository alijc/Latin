27.1 Proxima nocte centuriones Marsi duo ex castris Curionis cum
manipularibus suis XXII ad Attium Varum perfugiunt.  Hi, sive vere quam
habuerant opinionem ad eum perferunt, sive etiam auribus Vari serviunt
(nam, quae volumus, et credimus libenter et, quae sentimus ipsi, reliquos
sentire speramus), confirmant quidem certe totius exercitus animos
alienos esse a Curione maximeque opus esse in conspectum exercitus venire
et colloquendi dare facultatem.  Qua opinione adductus Varus postero die
mane legiones ex castris educit.  Facit idem Curio, atque una valle non
magna interiecta suas uterque copias instruit.


On the next night two of the Marsi centurions, with 22 privates, fled
from Curio's camp to Attius Varus.  They carried news to him, that they
either themselves truly believed, or that would be welcome to the ears of
Varus (for we freely believe what we wish to be true, and we hope that
everyone else thinks as we do).  In fact, they confirmed that the spirit
of the entire army was surely hostile to Curio, and that, especially in
the army's view, what was needed was for him to arrive and give the
opportunity for a parley.  Varus was persuaded by this opinion, and on
the next morning led his legions out of the camp.  Curio did the same,
and drew his forces up with a small valley lying between them.
