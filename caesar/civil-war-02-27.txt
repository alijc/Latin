27.1 Proxima nocte centuriones Marsi duo ex castris Curionis cum manipularibus
 suis XXII ad Attium Varum perfugiunt.

Hi, sive vere quam habuerant opinionem ad eum perferunt,
sive etiam auribus Vari serviunt
(nam, quae volumus, et credimus libenter et, quae sentimus ipsi, reliquos
sentire speramus),
confirmant quidem certe totius exercitus animos alienos esse a Curione maximeque
opus esse in conspectum exercitus venire et colloquendi dare facultatem.

Qua opinione adductus Varus postero die mane legiones ex castris educit.

Facit idem Curio, atque una valle non magna interiecta suas uterque copias
instruit. 


On the next night two Martian? centurions out of Curio's camp
with their 12 maniples fled to Attius Varus.

They, either truly which belief they had held, they carried through to him,
or still they serve Varus with ears
(for, the things we wish, and we believe willingly and, the things we ourselves
think, we hope that the rest think),
they declared indeed surely that the foriegn spirit of the entire army was
by/from Curio and especially the work was in the sight of the army to come
and speaking to give the means.

By which belief/opinion Varus, persuaded, on the next day in the morning led his
legions out of the camp.

Curio did the same, and in one valley not great thrown between he drew up
whether his forces.
