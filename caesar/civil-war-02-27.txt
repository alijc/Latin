27.1 Proxima nocte centuriones Marsi duo ex castris Curionis cum manipularibus
 suis XXII ad Attium Varum perfugiunt.

Hi, sive vere quam habuerant opinionem ad eum perferunt,
sive etiam auribus Vari serviunt
(nam, quae volumus, et credimus libenter et, quae sentimus ipsi, reliquos
sentire speramus),
confirmant quidem certe totius exercitus animos alienos esse a Curione maximeque
opus esse in conspectum exercitus venire et colloquendi dare facultatem.

Qua opinione adductus Varus postero die mane legiones ex castris educit.

Facit idem Curio, atque una valle non magna interiecta suas uterque copias
instruit. 


On the next night two of Marsus' centurions, with their 12 maniples,
fled from Curio's camp to Attius Varus.
They either carried news to him of the opinions that they themselves truly
held or still served Varus as his ears
(for, what we want to be true, and we freely believe and, what we ourselves
think, we hope that everyone else does as well).
They declared that the spirit of the entire army was assuredly hostile
to Curio, and that, especially in the army's view,
what was needed was to arrive at and provide the opportunity for a parley.
Varus was persuaded by this opinion, and on the next morning led his
legions out of the camp.
Curio did the same, and drew his forces up on a small rampart that had been
thrown between either his forces.
