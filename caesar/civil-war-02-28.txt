28.1
Erat in exercitu Vari Sextus Quintilius Varus,
quem fuisse Corfinii supra demonstratum est.

Hic dimissus a Caesare in Africam venerat,
legionesque eas traduxerat Curio,
quas superioribus temporibus Corfinio receperat Caesar,
adeo ut paucis mutatis centurionibus eidem ordines manipulique constarent.

Hanc nactus appellationis causam Quintilius circumire aciem Curionis
atque obsecrare milites coepit,
ne primam sacramenti,
quod apud Domitium atque apud se quaestorem dixissent,
memoriam deponerent,
neu contra eos arma ferrent,
qui eadem essent usi fortuna eademque in obsidione perpessi,
neu pro his pugnarent,
a quibus cum contumelia perfugae appellarentur.

Huc pauca ad spem largitionis addidit,
quae ab sua liberalitate,
si se atque Attium secuti essent,
exspectare deberent.

Hac habita oratione nullam in partem ab exercitu Curionis fit significatio,
atque ita suas uterque copias reducit.


In Varus' army was Sextus Quintilius Varus,
about whom we have previously told that he was at Corfinius.

This man having been sent away by Caesar, had come to Africa,
and Curio had brought the legions that Caesar had recently recovered at
Corfinius(m?),
exactly/to the point so that by small shifted centurions the same ranks and
companies they might agree.

Quintilius, having gotten this reason of title, commenced 
to go round Curio's battle line and to entreat the soldiers,
not to lay aside the first memory of their oath of allegiance,
which they'd sworn before Domitius and the quaestor,
or not bear arms against those who 
likewise were having made use of fortune
and likewise in the seige having endured all,
or not they might fight for these men,
by whom indignity of deserter they were
To this place a little to hope of generosity he added,
which by his liberality,
if slef and they had followed Attius,
tey ought to expect.

by this reasoned speech >none in part by Curio's army the signal happened,
and thus >his which/and troops he reduced/restored/led back.
