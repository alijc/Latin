29.1 At in castris Curionis magnus omnium incessit timor animis.

Is variis hominum sermonibus celeriter augetur.

Unusquisque enim opiniones fingebat et ad id,
quod ab alio audierat, sui aliquid timoris addebat.

Hoc ubi uno auctore ad plures permanaverat,
atque alius alii tradiderat,
plures auctores eius rei videbantur.

[Civile bellum; genus hominum;
cui liceret libere facere et sequi quod vellet;
legiones eae, quae paulo ante apud adversarios fuerant;
nam etiam Caesaris beneficium mutaverat consuetudo qua offerrentur;
municipia etiam diversis partibus coniuncta,
namque ex Marsis Pelignisque veniebant,
ut qui superiore nocte in contuberniis commilitesque;
nonnulli graviora; sermones militum;
dubia durius accipiebantur, nonnulla etiam ab eis,
qui diligentiores videri volebant, fingebantur.]


But in Curio's camp a great fear assaulted everyone's courage.
It spread rapidly by word of mouth.
For each man formed his own opinions, and and anything he heard from another man
added something more to his own fear.
And after one man passed it on to more,
and they related it to others,
they seemed to be even greater authorities on the business.

[
A civil war permits a certain sort of man
to freely do and strive for whatever he wishes;
the legions, that had recently been among the enemy;
for yet/still Caesar's >kindness had altered experience/habit
by which they had been offered;
yet/still the towns, connected to/by separate parts/regions,
for indeed out of Marsus and Pelignis they came,
so that he who in the height? of the night among his comrades;
some heavier; words of the soldiers;
doubts were grasped the sterner, yet several by this,
those more careful men who wished to seem, were shaped.
