30.1 Quibus de causis consilio convocato de summa rerum deliberare incipit.

Erant sententiae,
quae conandum omnibus modis castraque Vari oppugnanda censerent,
quod in huiusmodi militum consiliis otium maxime contrarium esse arbitrarentur;
postremo praestare dicebant per virtutem in pugna belli fortunam experiri,
quam desertos et circumventos ab suis gravissimum supplicium perpeti.

Erant, qui censerent de tertia vigilia in castra Cornelia recedendum,
ut maiore spatio temporis interiecto militum mentes sanarentur,
simul, si quid gravius accidisset,
magna multitudine navium et tutius et facilius in Siciliam receptus daretur.


For this reason he convened a counsel and began to consider the most
important of these matters. 
Some were of the opinion that recommended making the attempt at all costs and
attacking Varius' camp, because in their deliberations
they thought that these sort of soldiers were especially opposed to idleness.
In the end they said
that it would be better to put their fortune to the test in battle,
and to prevail by their courage,
than to suffer a horrible punishment surrounded and alone.
There were those who recommended a withdrawl to the Cornelian camp during the
third watch, so that after more time the soldiers' minds might be quieted,
while, if something worse were to befall them,
a retreat to Sicily could be provided both safely and easily
with a large mass of ships.
