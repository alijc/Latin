30.1 Quibus de causis consilio convocato de summa rerum deliberare incipit.

Erant sententiae,
quae conandum omnibus modis castraque Vari oppugnanda censerent,
quod in huiusmodi militum consiliis otium maxime contrarium esse arbitrarentur;
postremo praestare dicebant per virtutem in pugna belli fortunam experiri,
quam desertos et circumventos ab suis gravissimum supplicium perpeti.

Erant, qui censerent de tertia vigilia in castra Cornelia recedendum,
ut maiore spatio temporis interiecto militum mentes sanarentur,
simul, si quid gravius accidisset,
magna multitudine navium et tutius et facilius in Siciliam receptus daretur.


For this reason he convened a counsel and began a debate about the last of these
matters. 

There were opinions,
which going to be attempted to/by all manners and Varius' camp to be attacked
they reckoned,
because in this sort of the soldiers to/by advice leisure especially >adversary
to be they might be observed/judged;
to/by the following to prevail they said through the army in a battle of war
>fortune to be put to the test,
than >deserted and encircled by their very heavy punishment to endure.

There were, those who would suppose about the third watch in the Cornelian camp
to withdraw,
so that by the greater distance of time having interposed the soldiers' minds
might be quieted,
at the same time/likewise, if anything heavier might have befalled,
by a large crowd of ships both safely and easily into Sicily a retreat might be
given.
