31.1 Curio utrumque improbans consilium,
quantum alteri sententiae deesset animi,
tantum alteri superesse dicebat:
hos turpissimae fugae rationem habere,
illos etiam iniquo loco dimicandum putare.

"Qua enim," inquit, "fiducia et opere et natura loci munitissima castra
expugnari posse confidimus?

Aut vero quid proficimus,
si accepto magno detrimento ab oppugnatione castrorum discedimus?

Quasi non et felicitas rerum gestarum exercitus benevolentiam imperatoribus et
res adversae odia colligant!

Castrorum autem mutatio quid habet nisi turpem fugam et desperationem omnium et
alienationem exercitus?

Nam neque pudentes suspicari oportet sibi parum credi,
neque improbos scire sese timeri,
quod his licentiam timor augeat noster,
illis studia deminuat."

"Quod si iam," inquit, "haec explorata habeamus,
quae de exercitus alienatione dicuntur,
quae quidem ego aut omnino falsa aut certe minora opinione esse confido,
quanto haec dissimulari et occultari,
quam per nos confirmari praestet?

An non, uti corporis vulnera,
ita exercitus incommoda sunt tegenda, ne spem adversariis augeamus?

At etiam, ut media nocte proficiscamur, addunt,
quo maiorem, credo, licentiam habeant, qui peccare conentur.

Namque huiusmodi res aut pudore aut metu tenentur;
quibus rebus nox maxime adversaria est.

Quare neque tanti sum animi,
ut sine spe castra oppugnanda censeam,
neque tanti timoris, uti spe deficiam,
atque omnia prius experienda arbitror magnaque ex parte iam me una vobiscum de
re iudicium facturum confido." 


Curio whether/both rejecting the advice,
as much to the second/first opinion he might desert of the heart,
as of the other he was declaring to survive:
>the latter of/to disgraceful flight >reason to have,
>the former yet to/by unjust position for battle to think.

"For by which," he said, "confidence and need and nature of the place the
heavily defended camp we are confident to be able to be assaulted?

Or what have we really accomplished,
if we withdraw from the camp after suffering a major defeat from an attack?

As if not and the luck of the business the army >favor to/by the general and
>averion to the army?

For neither shameful/shamed to mistrust is it right to self of equals/too little
to be trusted, 
because to/by the latter our fear increases  >freedom,
to/by the former it lessens our zeal."

"Because if yet/I will march," he said, "we have these explored things,
which from the army to/by aversion they declare,
which indeed I either by an outright lie or surely by a lesser belief to be I
rely on,
how great these things to be concealed and hidden,
than through us to be proven/confirmed it is better?

or not, so that wounds of the body.
thus the army are disadvantages for defense,
lest >hope to/by the enemy we might raise?

And yet, in order to in the middle of the night we might depart, he added,
by which >greater, I believe, >liberty/disorder we might have,
who to blunder they might attempt.

For however the thing either to/by shame or fear they are held;
by which things the night is especially hostile.

Why neither such I am of mind,
so that without hope I might suppose the camp for an attack,
nor of such fear, that I have lost all hope,
and all to put to the test earlier I might decided
and great from the part still >me one with you from the thing
>trail about to do/make/act I have confidence."
