31.1 Curio utrumque improbans consilium,
quantum alteri sententiae deesset animi,
tantum alteri superesse dicebat:
hos turpissimae fugae rationem habere,
illos etiam iniquo loco dimicandum putare.

"Qua enim," inquit, "fiducia et opere et natura loci munitissima castra
expugnari posse confidimus?

Aut vero quid proficimus,
si accepto magno detrimento ab oppugnatione castrorum discedimus?

Quasi non et felicitas rerum gestarum exercitus benevolentiam imperatoribus et
res adversae odia colligant!

Castrorum autem mutatio quid habet nisi turpem fugam et desperationem omnium et
alienationem exercitus?

Nam neque pudentes suspicari oportet sibi parum credi,
neque improbos scire sese timeri,
quod his licentiam timor augeat noster,
illis studia deminuat."

"Quod si iam," inquit, "haec explorata habeamus,
quae de exercitus alienatione dicuntur,
quae quidem ego aut omnino falsa aut certe minora opinione esse confido,
quanto haec dissimulari et occultari,
quam per nos confirmari praestet?

An non, uti corporis vulnera,
ita exercitus incommoda sunt tegenda, ne spem adversariis augeamus?

At etiam, ut media nocte proficiscamur, addunt,
quo maiorem, credo, licentiam habeant, qui peccare conentur.

Namque huiusmodi res aut pudore aut metu tenentur;
quibus rebus nox maxime adversaria est.

Quare neque tanti sum animi,
ut sine spe castra oppugnanda censeam,
neque tanti timoris, uti spe deficiam,
atque omnia prius experienda arbitror magnaque ex parte iam me una vobiscum de
re iudicium facturum confido." 


Curio rejected the advice of both sides, saying that
as much as his heart might quail at the first opinion,
he was left at the other one:
that the latter group had found a reason for disgraceful flight,
while the former proposed to do battle from an unfavorable position.

"For," he said, "by what assurance and labor and nature of the place
can we rely on defending the camp from an assault?

Or what have we really accomplished,
if we withdraw from the camp after suffering a major defeat from an attack?

As if not both the bad luck of the events that had taken place,
due to the good will of the army towards their generals 
and the misfortune they might have reconciled the adveraries.

For it is fitting to neither mistrust shameful men
to be too little trusted
nor to fear that they know wicked men,
because with the latter our fear adds to disorder,
while with the former it lessens our zeal."

"Because if we still hold," he said, "to what we have examined,
which is said about a surrender of the army,
which indeed I hold to be either an outright lie or at least a minority opinion,
wouldn't it be better for these matters to be concealed and hidden,
than to be confirmed by us?

Or not, so that wounds of the body.
thus the army's troubles should be concealed
to keep from raising the enemy's hopes?

And yet, to decamp in the middle of the night, he added,
by which we'd have greater, I believe, disorder,
those who would try to blunder.

For however the matters by either shame or fear are held;
in these matters the night is especially hostile.

Therefor I am neither of such a mind,
that I think the camp without hope in the case of an attack,
nor of such fear that I have lost all hope,
and I believe, based on all my prior experience,
and I still trust my judgment on the future for the most part."
