32.1 Dimisso consilio contionem advocat militum.
Commemorat, quo sit eorum usus studio ad Corfinium Caesar,
ut magnam partem Italiae beneficio atque auctoritate eorum
suam fecerit.  "Vos enim vestrumque factum omnia," inquit,
"deinceps municipia sunt secuta, neque sine causa et
Caesar amicissime de vobis et illi gravissime
iudicaverunt.  Pompeius enim nullo proelio pulsus vestri
facti praeiudicio demotus Italia excessit; Caesar me, quem
sibi carissimum habuit, provinciam Siciliam atque Africam,
sine quibus urbem atque Italiam tueri non potest, vestrae
fidei commisit.  At sunt, qui vos hortentur, ut a nobis
desciscatis.  Quid enim est illis optatius, quam uno
tempore et nos circumvenire et vos nefario scelere
obstringere?  aut quid irati gravius de vobis sentire
possunt, quam ut eos prodatis, qui se vobis omnia debere
iudicant, in eorum potestatem veniatis, qui se per vos
perisse existimant?  An vero in Hispania res gestas
Caesaris non audistis?  duos pulsos exercitus, duos
superatos duces, duas receptas provincias?  haec acta
diebus XL, quibus in conspectum adversariorum venerit
Caesar?  An, qui incolumes resistere non potuerunt,
perditi resistant?  vos autem incerta victoria Caesarem
secuti diiudicata iam belli fortuna victum sequamini, cum
vestri officii praemia percipere debeatis?

After dismissing the council, he (Curio) called an
assembly of the soldiers.  He recalled how Caesar had made
use of their zeal at Corfinium, to make a great part of
Italy his own through their service and might.  "For," he
said, "one after another all the towns have followed you
and your doings, and not without cause both Caesar and the
enemy have judged you; he most amicably, and they most
grievously.  For Pompey withdrew from Italy, driven out
not by battle, but by your reputation; Caesar has
entrusted me, whom he holds so dear, and the provinces of
Sicily and Africa, without which he can not protect Rome
or Italy, into your keeping.  But there are those who urge
you to desert us.  For what is more welcome for them, than
to, in one swoop, encircle us and bind you up in a vile
crime?  Or what could they, angered, feel about you worse
than that you might betray those who judge that they owe
everything to you, were you to come into the power of
those who think that they would perish at your hands?
Surely too, haven't you heard of the things that Caesar
did in Spain?  two armies driven out, two generals
overcome, two provinces recovered?  with this accomplished
in 40 days after Caesar came into sight of the enemy?  Or,
can the routed stand firm, when they couldn't stand when
whole?  But would you, who followed Caesar in an uncertain
victory, now follow a way of life dependent on the
fortunes of war, when you are bound to secure the reward
for your service?


Desertos enim se ac proditos a vobis dicunt et prioris sacramenti
mentionem faciunt.  Vosne vero L. Domitium, an vos Domitius
deseruit?  Nonne extremam pati fortunam paratos proiecit ille?
nonne sibi clam salutem fuga petivit?  nonne proditi per illum
Caesaris beneficio estis conservati?  Sacramento quidem vos tenere
qui potuit, cum proiectis fascibus et deposito imperio privatus et
captus ipse in alienam venisset potestatem?  Relinquitur nova
religio, ut eo neglecto sacramento, quo tenemini, respiciatis
illud, quod deditione ducis et capitis deminutione sublatum est.

For they say that you deserted and betrayed them and call your
previous oath to mind.  Indeed, was it you who deserted
L. Domitius, or did he desert you?  Didn't he fling you away when
you were prepared for the ultimate fate?  Didn't he secretly seek
his own safety in flight?  Weren't you, after being betrayed by
him, preserved through Caesar's kindness?  Who indeed could hold
you to your oath, after he, throwing away his rods of office and
putting aside his command, came, a common prisoner, to a foreign
power?  Your new obligation is left, so that you should consider
that the disregarded oath by which you were bound was abrogated by
the surrender of your general and the forfeiture of his rights.



At, credo, si Caesarem probatis, in me offenditis.
Qui de meis in vos meritis praedicaturus non sum,
quae sunt adhuc et mea voluntate et vestra exspectatione leviora;
sed tamen sui laboris milites semper eventu belli praemia petiverunt,
qui qualis sit futurus, ne vos quidem dubitatis:
diligentiam quidem nostram aut, quem ad finem adhuc res processit,
fortunam cur praeteream?
An paenitet vos,
quod salvum atque incolumem exercitum nulla omnino nave desiderata traduxerim?
quod classem hostium primo impetu adveniens profligaverim?
quod bis per biduum equestri proelio superaverim?
quod ex portu sinuque adversariorum CC naves oneratas abduxerim
eoque illos compulerim,
ut neque pedestri itinere neque navibus commeatu iuvari possint?
Hac vos fortuna atque his ducibus repudiatis Corfiniensem ignominiam,
Italiae fugam, Hispaniarum deditionem, Africi belli praeiudicia, sequimini!
Equidem me Caesaris militem dici volui,
vos me imperatoris nomine appellavistis.
Cuius si vos paenitet, vestrum vobis beneficium remitto,
mihi meum nomen restituite, ne ad contumeliam honorem dedisse videamini."


But, I believe, if you approve of Caesar, you find offense in me,
who should not be praised for my service to you.
Till now this service has been both of my own free will
and the least of your expectations;
but still soldiers always want rewards for their labor in a war,
which is in the works, believe it or not:
Indeed, why should I pass over our diligence or our fortune,
which the business has advanced to the end?

Can it be that it displeases you,
that I brought the army across safe and sound, without losing a single ship?
that I routed the enemy fleet in the very first attack after my arrival?
that I won two cavalry battles two days?
that I drove 200 of the enemy galleys out of the harbor and bay
and subsequently drove them together,
to withhold from them the succor the approach of either the infantry or the
fleet?  

By this fortune and by these commanders you repudiate the disgrace of
Corfinium, the flight to Italy, the Spanish surrender,
the example of the African war, follow! 

Truly, I wished that Caesar's soldiers had been called by me,
you have given me the title of Imperator.

And if this displeases you, may I return your service to you,
restore my name to me, lest you seem to give honor to indignity.
