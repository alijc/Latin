32.1 Dimisso consilio contionem advocat militum.
Commemorat, quo sit eorum usus studio ad Corfinium Caesar,
ut magnam partem Italiae beneficio atque auctoritate eorum
suam fecerit.  "Vos enim vestrumque factum omnia," inquit,
"deinceps municipia sunt secuta, neque sine causa et
Caesar amicissime de vobis et illi gravissime
iudicaverunt.  Pompeius enim nullo proelio pulsus vestri
facti praeiudicio demotus Italia excessit; Caesar me, quem
sibi carissimum habuit, provinciam Siciliam atque Africam,
sine quibus urbem atque Italiam tueri non potest, vestrae
fidei commisit.  At sunt, qui vos hortentur, ut a nobis
desciscatis.  Quid enim est illis optatius, quam uno
tempore et nos circumvenire et vos nefario scelere
obstringere?  aut quid irati gravius de vobis sentire
possunt, quam ut eos prodatis, qui se vobis omnia debere
iudicant, in eorum potestatem veniatis, qui se per vos
perisse existimant?  An vero in Hispania res gestas
Caesaris non audistis?  duos pulsos exercitus, duos
superatos duces, duas receptas provincias?  haec acta
diebus XL, quibus in conspectum adversariorum venerit
Caesar?  An, qui incolumes resistere non potuerunt,
perditi resistant?  vos autem incerta victoria Caesarem
secuti diiudicata iam belli fortuna victum sequamini, cum
vestri officii praemia percipere debeatis?


After dismissing the council, he (Curio) called an
assembly of the soldiers.  He recalled how Caesar had made
use of their zeal at Corfinium, to make a great part of
Italy his own through their service and might.  "For," he
said, "one after another all the towns have followed you
and your doings, and not without cause both Caesar and the
enemy have judged you; he most amicably, and they most
grievously.  For Pompey withdrew from Italy, driven out
not by battle, but by your reputation; Caesar has
entrusted me, whom he holds so dear, and the provinces of
Sicily and Africa, without which he can not protect Rome
or Italy, into your keeping.  But there are those who urge
you to desert us.  For what is more welcome for them, than
to, in one swoop, encircle us and bind you up in a vile
crime?  Or what could they, angered, feel about you worse
than that you might betray those who judge that they owe
everything to you, were you to come into the power of
those who think that they would perish at your hands?
Surely too, haven't you heard of the things that Caesar
did in Spain?  two armies driven out, two generals
overcome, two provinces recovered?  with this accomplished
in 40 days after Caesar came into sight of the enemy?  Or,
can the routed stand firm, when they couldn't stand when
whole?  But would you, who followed Caesar in an uncertain
victory, now follow a way of life dependent on the
fortunes of war, when you are bound to secure the reward
for your service?
