32.1 Dimisso consilio contionem advocat militum.

Commemorat, quo sit eorum usus studio ad Corfinium Caesar,
ut magnam partem Italiae beneficio atque auctoritate eorum suam fecerit.

"Vos enim vestrumque factum omnia," inquit, "deinceps municipia sunt secuta,
neque sine causa et Caesar amicissime de vobis et illi gravissime iudicaverunt.

Pompeius enim nullo proelio pulsus vestri facti praeiudicio demotus Italia
 excessit;
Caesar me, quem sibi carissimum habuit,
provinciam Siciliam atque Africam,
sine quibus urbem atque Italiam tueri non potest,
vestrae fidei commisit.

At sunt, qui vos hortentur, ut a nobis desciscatis.

Quid enim est illis optatius,
quam uno tempore et nos circumvenire et vos nefario scelere obstringere?

aut quid irati gravius de vobis sentire possunt, quam ut eos prodatis,
qui se vobis omnia debere iudicant, in eorum potestatem veniatis,
qui se per vos perisse existimant?

An vero in Hispania res gestas Caesaris non audistis?
duos pulsos exercitus, duos superatos duces, duas receptas provincias?
haec acta diebus XL, quibus in conspectum adversariorum venerit Caesar?

An, qui incolumes resistere non potuerunt, perditi resistant?

vos autem incerta victoria Caesarem secuti diiudicata iam belli fortuna
victum sequamini, cum vestri officii praemia percipere debeatis?


After dismissing the council, Curio calls for an assembly of the soldiers.

He recalls, by which zeal Caesar might be use to Corfinium,
so that, by their favor and authority, he'd made a great part of Italy his own.

"For you and your deed all," he said, "in turn the towns have followed,
and not without cause and Caesar with great goodwill from you and they most
gravely have judged.

For Pompey by/to no battle driven out of your deed to/by precedent banished from
Italy he withdrew;
Caesar me, whom he had held so dear to himself,
>province of Sicily and Africa,
with which >city and >Italy he can not protect, he united by your loyalty.

But there are those who urge you to desert us.

For what is to those more welcome,
than at one time and we/us to surround and you by wicked crime to confine?

or what angered more gravely from you to percieve they can,
than so that you might forsake them,
who conclude that they owe everything to you, into their power you might come,
who suppose that they would perish by you?

And surely, haven't you heard of the things done by Caesar in Spain?
two armies driven out, two generals overcome, two provinces recovered?
with this accomplished in 40 days after Caesar came into sight of the enemy?

Whether/or, who cannot continue unharmed, they continue broken/done for?

but you who followed Caesar by uncertain victory decided already by the fortune
of war follow the way of life, when you ought to secure the reward for your
service?
