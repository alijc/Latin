33.1 Qua oratione permoti milites crebro etiam dicentem interpellabant,
ut magno cum dolore infidelitatis suspicionem sustinere viderentur,
discedentem vero ex contione universi cohortantur, magno sit animo,
necubi dubitet proelium committere et suam fidem virtutemque experiri.
Quo facto commutata omnium et voluntate et opinione consensu summo
constituit Curio, cum primum sit data potestas, proelio rem committere
posteroque die productos eodem loco, quo superioribus diebus
constiterat, in acie collocat.  Ne Varus quidem dubitat copias
producere, sive sollicitandi milites sive aequo loco dimicandi detur
occasio, ne facultatem praetermittat.


The soldiers, deeply moved by this speech, broke in on the speaker
then, to show that they were in anguish over the suspicion of
disloyalty.  In fact, as he left the assembly, they were all exhorted
him to be of great courage, and to have no hesitation to engage in
battle and put their loyalty to the test.  From this Curio resolved,
due to the wholly altered good will and opinion of them all to the
utmost agreement, to commit the matter to battle the first time that he
got the chance.  And on the next day he placed his men in a battle
array at the same place that he'd made a stand in the previous days.
Varus didn't hesitate a whit to bring out his troops, fearing to let
the chance pass him by, he was given the opportunity of either
disturbing his soldiers or fighting in a unfavorable position.
