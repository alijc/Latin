35.1 Qua in fuga Fabius Pelignus quidam ex infimis ordinibus de exercitu
Curionis primus agmen fugientium consecutus magna voce Varum nomine appellans
requirebat,
uti unus esse ex eius militibus et monere aliquid velle ac dicere videretur.

Ubi ille saepius appellatus aspexit ac restitit et,
quis esset aut quid vellet, quaesivit,
umerum apertum gladio appetit paulumque afuit,
quin Varum interficeret;
quod ille periculum sublato ad eius conatum scuto vitavit.

Fabius a proximis militibus circumventus interficitur.

Hac fugientium multitudine ac turba portae castrorum occupantur atque iter
 impeditur, pluresque in eo loco sine vulnere quam in proelio aut fuga
 intereunt,
 neque multum afuit, quin etiam castris expellerentur, ac nonnulli protinus
 eodem cursu in oppidum contenderunt.

Sed cum loci natura et munitio castrorum aditum prohibebant,
tum quod ad proelium egressi Curionis milites eis rebus indigebant,
quae ad oppugnationem castrorum erant usui.

Itaque Curio exercitum in castra reducit suis omnibus praeter Fabium
 incolumibus,
 ex numero adversariorum circiter DC interfectis ac mille vulneratis;
 qui omnes discessu Curionis multique praeterea per simulationem vulnerum ex
 castris in oppidum propter timorem sese recipiunt.

Qua re animadversa Varus et terrore exercitus cognito bucinatore in castris et
paucis ad speciem tabernaculis relictis de tertia vigilia silentio exercitum in
oppidum reducit.



In which flight Fabius Pelignus, one of the lowest rank of Curio's army,
first having been pursued was seeking the fleeing column,
calling Varus by name in a loud voice,
so that he alone of his soldiers seemed and to warn anything to wish and to say.

Where/when he often having been called he gazed and stood firm and
asked who was or wished to be what,
>upper arm/shoulder exposed/opened with a sword he strove and was not far off,
so that he not kill Varus;
because he avoided the danger by raising his shield to his attempt.

Fabius, encircled by the nearest soldiers, was killed.

By this great number and crowd of fleeing men the gates of the camp
were captured and the road was obstructed, and more died in this place
without a wound than in battle or flight,
and not much far off, so that not from the camp they were driven off,
and several immediately by the same course/rush into town
competed/strove/rushed.

But when the nature of the place and defenses of the camp hindered access,
then, because >the battle Curio's soldiers required these things,
which to assault of the camp were of use.

And so Curio led the army back to camp to/by all his uninjured except for
Fabius,
of the number of enemy around 600 having been killed and a thousand injured;
who all by Curio's withdrawal and many besides through deceit of wounds
out of camp into town on account of fear betook themselves.

Which, Varus having taken notice of, and panic having been known by the
trumpeter, the army in camp and to/by few tents abandoned to sight from the
third watch in silence he led the army back into town.
