36.1 Postero die Curio obsidere Uticam et vallo circummunire instituit.

Erat in oppido multitudo insolens belli diuturnitate otii,
Uticenses pro quibusdam Caesaris in se beneficiis illi amicissimi,
conventus is qui ex variis generibus constaret,
terror ex superioribus proeliis magnus.

Itaque de deditione omnes palam loquebantur et cum P. Attio agebant,
ne sua pertinacia omnium fortunas perturbari vellet.

Haec cum agerentur,
nuntii praemissi ab rege Iuba venerunt,
qui illum adesse cum magnis copiis dicerent et de custodia ac defensione urbis
hortarentur.

Quae res eorum perterritos animos confirmavit.


On the following day Curio set about besieging Utica and fortifying the valley.

There were many in the town who were unused to war because there hadn't been one
for a long time,
Uticians very loyal due to Caesar's favors towards them,
 he who had established assemblies of various sorts,
and a general panic from the latest battle.

And so all were talking about and urging surrender to P. Attius,
lest by his own obstanacy he should want the fortunes of them all to be
thrown into confusion.

While these were so urging,
the messengers that King Juba had sent ahead arrived,
to say that he was nearby with a great number of troops,
and to encourage the protection and defense of the city.

And this matter enboldened their terrified souls.
