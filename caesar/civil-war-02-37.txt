37.1 Nuntiabantur haec eadem Curioni, sed aliquamdiu fides fieri non
poterat: tantam habebat suarum rerum fiduciam.  Iamque Caesaris in
Hispania res secundae in Africam nuntiis ac litteris perferebantur.
Quibus omnibus rebus sublatus nihil contra se regem nisurum existimabat.
Sed ubi certis auctoribus comperit minus V et XX milibus longe ab Utica
eius copias abesse, relictis munitionibus sese in castra Cornelia
recepit.  Huc frumentum comportare, castra munire, materiam conferre
coepit statimque in Siciliam misit, uti duae legiones reliquusque
equitatus ad se mitteretur.  Castra erant ad bellum ducendum aptissima
natura loci et munitione et maris propinquitate et aquae et salis copia,
cuius magna vis iam ex proximis erat salinis eo congesta.  Non materia
multitudine arborum, non frumentum, cuius erant plenissimi agri,
deficere poterat.  Itaque omnium suorum consensu Curio reliquas copias
exspectare et bellum ducere parabat.


These same things were reported to Curio, but some while he couldn't
credit them: so great was the confidence that he had in his own affairs.
And the fortunate affairs of Caesar in Spain were already being carried
into Africa through messengers and letters.  And cheered by all these
thing, he judged that the king would by no means go all out against him.
But when he learned from reliable informants that the king's forces were
within 25 miles of Utica, he withdrew to the remaining fortifications in
Camp Cornelia.  He began to transport provisions to here, to fortify the
camp, to amass wood and straightway sent word to Sicily, to send two
legions and the remaining cavalry to him.  The camp was well disposed
for a long war, by the most suitable nature of the place and by the
fortifications and by its nearness to the sea and by a supply of water
and of salt, a great quantity of which had already been heaped up in
saltpits there.  He could not lack either lumber, from the multitude of
trees, or grain, which lay thick in the fields.  And so, with the
agreement of all his men, Curio was prepared to wait for the rest of the
troops and wage war.
