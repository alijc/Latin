37.1 Nuntiabantur haec eadem Curioni,
sed aliquamdiu fides fieri non poterat:
tantam habebat suarum rerum fiduciam.

Iamque Caesaris in Hispania res secundae in Africam
nuntiis ac litteris perferebantur.

Quibus omnibus rebus sublatus nihil contra se regem nisurum existimabat.

Sed ubi certis auctoribus comperit
minus V et XX milibus longe ab Utica eius copias abesse,
relictis munitionibus sese in castra Cornelia recepit.

Huc frumentum comportare, castra munire,
materiam conferre coepit statimque in Siciliam misit,
uti duae legiones reliquusque equitatus ad se mitteretur.

Castra erant ad bellum ducendum aptissima natura loci et munitione et maris
propinquitate et aquae et salis copia,
cuius magna vis iam ex proximis erat salinis eo congesta.

Non materia multitudine arborum,
non frumentum, cuius erant plenissimi agri, deficere poterat.

Itaque omnium suorum consensu Curio reliquas copias exspectare et bellum ducere
parabat.


These same things were reported to Curio,
but for some time loyalties to happen/result he was unable:
so great was the trust/confidence that he had in his own affairs.

And the fortunate affairs of Caesar in Spain were already
being carried into Africa through messengers and letters.

by all which things he being elated/raised, judged that he must advance on the
king that was facing him.

But when/where to/by fixed authors he learned
less 5 and 20 thousand far off from Utica his >forces to be away,
to/by the rest of the fortifications self in camp Cornelia he recovered.

to here the grain to transport, the camp to fortify,
>wood to amass he began and straightway into Sicily he sent,
so that two legions and the remaining cavalry to himself should be sent.

The camp was to warfare to be led by the most suitable nature of the place
and by the fortifications and
by the nearness of the sea and a by supply of water and of salt,
whose great strength had already been piled up by salt-pans by him.

not by much wood of trees,
not grain, whose fields were very full, he was able to be deficient.

and so of all his men by agreement Curio to await the rest of the troops and to
wage war was ready.
