38.1 His constitutis rebus probatisque consiliis ex perfugis
quibusdam oppidanis audit Iubam revocatum finitimo bello
et controversiis Leptitanorum restitisse in regno,
Saburram, eius praefectum,
cum mediocribus copiis missum Uticae appropinquare.

His auctoribus temere credens consilium commutat et proelio rem committere
constituit.

Multum ad hanc rem probandam adiuvat adulescentia,
magnitudo animi, superioris temporis proventus,
fiducia rei bene gerendae.

His rebus impulsus equitatum omnem prima nocte ad castra hostium mittit ad
 flumen Bagradam, quibus praeerat Saburra, de quo ante erat auditum;
 sed rex omnibus copiis insequebatur et sex milium passuum intervallo a Saburra
 consederat.

Equites missi nocte iter conficiunt,
imprudentes atque inopinantes hostes aggrediuntur.

Numidae enim quadam barbara consuetudine nullis ordinibus passim consederant.

Hos oppressos somno et dispersos adorti magnum eorum numerum interficiunt;
multi perterriti profugiunt.

Quo facto ad Curionem equites revertuntur captivosque ad eum reducunt.


After the plans were approved and these things were set in motion,
he heard, from certain deserters who'd taken refuge in the area,
that Juba, called back by a nearby war the rebels of Leptitan??,
had made a stand/remained in his kingdom,
and that Saburra, his prefect,
with common troops was approaching Utica, having been sent.

by/to these authorities to rashly trusting advice he changed his plan and
resolved to commit the matter to battle.

much to this thing ought to be examined his youth aided,
the greatness of his soul, his recent success.
confidence of/to the thing well ought to be carried;
but the king with/to all troops was pursuing/attacking
and six miles to/by distance from Saburra he had taken up a position/camped.

the cavalry assembled, sent by night march,
unaware and off guard they approached the enemy.

For the Numidians by a certain foreign habit by/to no order here and there
camped.

They killed these overwhelmed by sleep and scattered men attacked great number
of them; many panicked and fled.

bu which event to Curio the cavalry returned and led captives to him.
