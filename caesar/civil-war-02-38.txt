38.1 His constitutis rebus probatisque consiliis ex perfugis quibusdam
oppidanis audit Iubam revocatum finitimo bello et controversiis
Leptitanorum restitisse in regno, Saburram, eius praefectum, cum
mediocribus copiis missum Uticae appropinquare.  His auctoribus temere
credens consilium commutat et proelio rem committere constituit.
Multum ad hanc rem probandam adiuvat adulescentia, magnitudo animi,
superioris temporis proventus, fiducia rei bene gerendae.  His rebus
impulsus equitatum omnem prima nocte ad castra hostium mittit ad
flumen Bagradam, quibus praeerat Saburra, de quo ante erat auditum;
sed rex omnibus copiis insequebatur et sex milium passuum intervallo a
Saburra consederat.  Equites missi nocte iter conficiunt, imprudentes
atque inopinantes hostes aggrediuntur.  Numidae enim quadam barbara
consuetudine nullis ordinibus passim consederant.  Hos oppressos somno
et dispersos adorti magnum eorum numerum interficiunt; multi
perterriti profugiunt.  Quo facto ad Curionem equites revertuntur
captivosque ad eum reducunt.


After approving these plans and setting them in motion, he heard, from
some townspeople who had deserted to him, that Juba had remained in
his kingdom, called back to deal with a war on his borders and a
quarrel with the Leptians, and that Saburra, his prefect, who'd been
sent with a smaller number of troops, was approaching Utica.  Rashly
trusting the advice of these informants, he changed his plan and
resolved to commit to battle.  His youth, his great spirit, his recent
success, and his confidence aided a great deal in convincing himself
that the thing would come off well.  Urged by these things he sent all
his cavalry early in the night to the enemy camp at the River Bagrada,
which was under the command of Saburra, about whom we have already
heard; but the king was following behind with all his troops and
pitched camp six miles away from Saburra.  The cavalry passed the
night marching and approached the enemy, unsuspecting and off guard.
For the Numidians, by some strange foreign habit, set up camp here and
there without any order.  They fell upon these men, scattered and
overwhelmed by sleep, and killed a great many of them; many others
panicked and fled.  When this was done the cavalry returned to Curio,
leading its captives to him.
