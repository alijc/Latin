38.1 His constitutis rebus probatisque consiliis ex perfugis
quibusdam oppidanis audit Iubam revocatum finitimo bello
et controversiis Leptitanorum restitisse in regno,
Saburram, eius praefectum,
cum mediocribus copiis missum Uticae appropinquare.
His auctoribus temere credens consilium commutat et proelio rem committere
constituit.
Multum ad hanc rem probandam adiuvat adulescentia,
magnitudo animi, superioris temporis proventus,
fiducia rei bene gerendae.

His rebus impulsus equitatum omnem prima nocte ad castra hostium mittit ad
 flumen Bagradam, quibus praeerat Saburra, de quo ante erat auditum;
 sed rex omnibus copiis insequebatur et sex milium passuum intervallo a Saburra
 consederat.

Equites missi nocte iter conficiunt,
imprudentes atque inopinantes hostes aggrediuntur.
Numidae enim quadam barbara consuetudine nullis ordinibus passim consederant.
Hos oppressos somno et dispersos adorti magnum eorum numerum interficiunt;
multi perterriti profugiunt.
Quo facto ad Curionem equites revertuntur captivosque ad eum reducunt.


After approving these plans and setting them in motion,
he heard, from some deserters who'd taken refuge in the area,
that Juba had remained in his kingdom, recalled to deal with
a war on his borders and a quarrel with the Leptians,
and that Saburra, his prefect, who'd been sent 
with a moderate number of troops, was approaching Utica.
Rashly trusting the advice of these informants, he changed his plan and
resolved to commit the matter to battle.

Much in regards to this matter that needs to be examined,
aided by his youth, the greatness of his soul, his recent success,
and his confidence in the matter being well carried out;

Urged by these things he sent all his cavalry early in the night to the
enemy camp at the River Bagrada, which was under the command of Saburra,
about whom he had already heard;
but the king was following behind with all his troops
and pitched camp six miles away from Saburra.

The cavalry, sent on a night march, completed it and approached the enemy,
unsuspecting and off guard.

For the Numidians, by some strange foreign habit,
set up camp here and there without any order.

They fell upon these men who were overwhelmed by sleep and scattered
and killed a great many of them; many others panicked and fled.

When this was done the cavalry returned to Curio and led its captives to him.
