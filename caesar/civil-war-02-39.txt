39.1 Curio cum omnibus copiis quarta vigilia exierat cohortibus V castris
 praesidio relictis.

Progressus milia passuum VI equites convenit, rem gestam cognovit;
e captivis quaerit, quis castris ad Bagradam praesit: respondent Saburram.

Reliqua studio itineris conficiendi quaerere praetermittit
proximaque respiciens signa,
"videtisne," inquit, "milites, captivorum orationem cum perfugis convenire?
abesse regem, exiguas esse copias missas,
quae paucis equitibus pares esse non potuerint?
Proinde ad praedam, ad gloriam properate,
ut iam de praemiis vestris et de referenda gratia cogitare incipiamus."

Erant per se magna, quae gesserant equites,
praesertim cum eorum exiguus numerus cum tanta multitudine Numidarum confertur.

Haec tamen ab ipsis inflatius commemorabantur,
ut de suis homines laudibus libenter praedicant.

Multa praeterea spolia praeferebantur,
capti homines equique producebantur,
ut, quicquid intercederet temporis, hoc omne victoriam morari videretur.

Ita spei Curionis militum studia non deerant.

Equites sequi iubet sese iterque accelerat,
ut quam maxime ex fuga perterritos adoriri posset.

At illi itinere totius noctis confecti subsequi non poterant,
atque alii alio loco resistebant.

Ne haec quidem Curionem ad spem morabantur.


Curio with all his troops in the fourth watch had marched out of the camp,
leaving 5 cohorts as a garrison.

having advanced 6 miles he assembled the cavalry, he became aware of what was
going on;
and asked his prisoners who was in command of the camp at the Bagrada,
and they replied: Saburra.

the rest to/by zeal of the march about to be accomplished he omitted to ask/seek
and looking back at the nearest battle standards, said,
"Don't you see, soldiers, that the prisoners' speech agrees with the deserters'?
That the king is not here, that few troops have been sent,
which to/by few horse the equal to be not will be able?
So then, to spoils, to renown be quick,
to now/already about your rewards and about what will be carried home in
gratitude to think we might begin."

there were through selves great things, that the cavalry had done,
especially when their meager number with such a multitude of Numidians was
matched against.

Nevertheless these things were remembered more inflated by them,
to from their own renown men willingly proclaim.

besides many spoils they were preferring,
captured men and horses they were being led forward,
to, whatever might intervene of time, seem that the victory be delayed by all this.

So the to/of hope of Curio of the soldiers with zeal weren't lacking.

He ordered the cavalry to pursue them and hastened the march,
to be able as much as possible from flight >panicked men to be attacked.

But they on the march the whole night accomplished to pursue they could not,
and some to/by another place were standing.\

Not even these things >Curio to hope were delayed.
