40.1
Iuba certior factus a Saburra de nocturno proelio II milia Hispanorum et
Gallorum equitum,
quos suae custodiae causa circum se habere consuerat,
et peditum eam partem, cui maxime confidebat, Saburrae submisit;
ipse cum reliquis copiis elephantisque LX lentius subsequitur.

Suspicatus praemissis equitibus ipsum affore Curionem Saburra copias equitum
peditumque instruit atque his imperat,
ut simulatione timoris paulatim cedant ac pedem referant:
sese, cum opus esset, signum proelii daturum et,
quod rem postulare cognovisset, imperaturum.

Curio ad superiorem spem addita praesentis temporis opinione hostes fugere
arbitratus copias ex locis superioribus in campum deducit. 


Juba, made more sure by Saburra about the night-time battle 2 thousand Spanishs
and French horse, which he was in the habit of keeping around him for
protection,
and the part of the foot, that he trusted the most, he had relieved Saburra;
himself with the rest of the troops and elephants 60 he was following more
slowly.

Having mistrusted, having sent ahead horse, >himself Saburra togoto? >troops of
horse and foot he prepared and ordered to/by this,
in order to by deceit of fear little by little they might withdraw and retreat:
self, when it was need, >battle standard about to give and,
that/what/because >thing to demand he might learn, about to command.

Curio to higher hope by a belief added at the present time that the enemy would
flee, having judged, he drew the troops out of higher places into the plain.
