40.1
Iuba certior factus a Saburra de nocturno proelio II milia Hispanorum et
Gallorum equitum,
quos suae custodiae causa circum se habere consuerat,
et peditum eam partem, cui maxime confidebat, Saburrae submisit;
ipse cum reliquis copiis elephantisque LX lentius subsequitur.

Suspicatus praemissis equitibus ipsum affore Curionem Saburra copias equitum
peditumque instruit atque his imperat,
ut simulatione timoris paulatim cedant ac pedem referant:
sese, cum opus esset, signum proelii daturum et,
quod rem postulare cognovisset, imperaturum.

Curio ad superiorem spem addita praesentis temporis opinione hostes fugere
arbitratus copias ex locis superioribus in campum deducit. 


After Saburra had informed him more fully about the night-battle,
Juba dispatched the two thousand Spanish and French horse
that he habitually kept around him for protection,
along with that part of the infantry that he thought the most reliable.
He himself was following more slowly with the rest of the troops and 60
elephants.

Having mistrusted, having sent his horse ahead,
Saburra >himself togoto?
he drew up his forces of horse and foot and ordered them
to withdraw and retreat, little by little, under a semblance of fear:

self, when it was need, to be going to give the signal for battle and,
that/what/because >thing to demand he might learn, about to command.

Curio to higher hope by a belief added at the present time that the enemy would
flee, having judged, he drew the troops out of higher places into the plain.
