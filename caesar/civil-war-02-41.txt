41.1 Quibus ex locis cum longius esset progressus,
confecto iam labore exercitu XII milium spatio constitit.
Dat suis signum Saburra,
aciem constituit et circumire ordines atque hortari incipit;
sed peditatu dumtaxat procul ad speciem utitur,
equites in aciem immittit.
Non deest negotio Curio suosque hortatur,
ut spem omnem in virtute reponant.
Ne militibus quidem ut defessis neque equitibus ut paucis et labore confectis
studium ad pugnandum virtusque deerat;
sed hi erant numero CC, reliqui in itinere substiterant.
Hi, quamcumque in partem impetum fecerant, hostes loco cedere cogebant,
sed neque longius fugientes prosequi neque vehementius equos incitare poterant.
At equitatus hostium ab utroque cornu circumire aciem nostram et aversos
proterere incipit.
Cum cohortes ex acie procucurrissent,
Numidae integri celeritate impetum nostrorum effugiebant rursusque ad ordines
suos se recipientes circumibant et ab acie excludebant.
Sic neque in loco manere ordinesque servare neque procurrere et casum subire
 tutum videbatur.
Hostium copiae submissis ab rege auxiliis crebro augebantur;
nostros vires lassitudine deficiebant, simul ei,
qui vulnera acceperant,
neque acie excedere neque in locum tutum referri poterant,
quod tota acies equitatu hostium circumdata tenebatur.
Hi de sua salute desperantes, ut extremo vitae tempore homines facere
consuerunt,
aut suam mortem miserabantur aut parentes suos commendabant,
si quos ex eo periculo fortuna servare potuisset.
Plena erant omnia timoris et luctus.


When Curio had advanced pretty far from his positions,
after a 12-mile trudge by the army, he made a stand.
Saburra gave his men the signal,
he formed up his front line and began to urge them to surround our ranks.
But he employed the infantry to this extent far off to sight,
he sent the calvary into the front line.
Curio wasn't lacking in this affair and urged his own men on,
to restore their hopes by his courage.

Indeed, in neither the infantry, however exhausted, nor the cavalry,
however few and done in by their labor,
were zeal for the battle and courage lacking;
but they were only 200 in number, as the rest had halted their march.

These men, no matter where they launched an attack,
forced the enemy to fall back,
but could neither pursue the fleeing men for long,
nor spur their horses on any harder.

But the enemy's cavalry began to wear away at our front line and our men from
behind from either wing.

Whenever the cohorts charged forward from our front line,
the fresh Numidians would quickly flee our attack
and, after retreating back to their ranks,
would wheel around and cut our men off from their lines.

And so it didn't seem safe to either stay in one place and protect our ranks
or to charge forward and sink into calamity.

The enemy troops were being augmented, having received reinforcements from the
king, while our men were were dropping off with exhaustion.

At the same time those who had been wounded could neither withdraw from the
front line nor be brought to a place of safety,
because the whole front line was under the control of the enemy cavalry.

They, in despair of their safety, as men are wont to do in the last
extremity of their lives,
either lamented their own deaths or commended their parents,
if fortune could save anyone from this peril.

They were all filled with dread and grief.
