41.1 Quibus ex locis cum longius esset progressus,
confecto iam labore exercitu XII milium spatio constitit.
Dat suis signum Saburra,
aciem constituit et circumire ordines atque hortari incipit;
sed peditatu dumtaxat procul ad speciem utitur,
equites in aciem immittit.
Non deest negotio Curio suosque hortatur,
ut spem omnem in virtute reponant.
Ne militibus quidem ut defessis neque equitibus ut paucis et labore confectis
studium ad pugnandum virtusque deerat;
sed hi erant numero CC, reliqui in itinere substiterant.
Hi, quamcumque in partem impetum fecerant, hostes loco cedere cogebant,
sed neque longius fugientes prosequi neque vehementius equos incitare poterant.
At equitatus hostium ab utroque cornu circumire aciem nostram et aversos
proterere incipit.

Cum cohortes ex acie procucurrissent,
Numidae integri celeritate impetum nostrorum effugiebant rursusque ad ordines
suos se recipientes circumibant et ab acie excludebant.

Sic neque in loco manere ordinesque servare neque procurrere et casum subire
 tutum videbatur.

Hostium copiae submissis ab rege auxiliis crebro augebantur;
nostros vires lassitudine deficiebant, simul ei,
qui vulnera acceperant,
neque acie excedere neque in locum tutum referri poterant,
quod tota acies equitatu hostium circumdata tenebatur.

Hi de sua salute desperantes, ut extremo vitae tempore homines facere
consuerunt,
aut suam mortem miserabantur aut parentes suos commendabant,
si quos ex eo periculo fortuna servare potuisset.

Plena erant omnia timoris et luctus.


When he had advanced further from these positions,
to/by prepared already labor by the army of 12,000 in the space he made a stand.

Saburra gave his men the signal,
he formed up the front line and to surround the ranks and to urge he began;
but he employed the infantry to this extent far off to sight,
he sent the calvary into the front line.

Curio wasn't lacking in the affair and urged his own men on,
to restore their hopes by his courage;
but their were in number 200, the rest had halted theri march.

These, in whichever part they had launched an attack, the enemy forced them to
fall back from the place,
but and not longer/more distant fleeing to pursue and not more violently >horses

But the enemy's cavalry by both wings >our front line and >routed/hostile men
began to crush.

when the cohorts out of the front line had run ahead,
the fresh Numidians with speed >attack of our men fled
and back to our ranks retreating they encircled and from the front line

Thus and not in place to remain and ranks to protect and not to run forward and
