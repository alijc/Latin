42.1 Curio, ubi perterritis omnibus neque cohortationes suas neque preces audiri intellegit,
 unam ut in miseris rebus spem reliquam salutis esse arbitratus,
 proximos colles capere universos atque eo signa inferri iubet.
Hos quoque praeoccupat missus a Saburra equitatus.
Tum vero ad summam desperationem nostri perveniunt et partim fugientes ab
equitatu interficiuntur, partim integri procumbunt.
Hortatur Curionem Cn. Domitius, praefectus equitum,
cum paucis equitibus circumsistens,
ut fuga salutem petat atque in castra contendat,
et se ab eo non discessurum pollicetur.
At Curio numquam se amisso exercitu,
quem a Caesare fidei commissum acceperit,
in eius conspectum reversurum confirmat atque ita proelians interficitur.
Equites ex proelio perpauci se recipiunt;
sed ei, quos ad novissimum agmen equorum reficiendorum causa substitisse
demonstratum est,
fuga totius exercitus procul animadversa sese incolumes in castra conferunt.
Milites ad unum omnes interficiuntur.

Curio, when he realized neither his exhortations nor entreaties were being heard
by all his panicked men,
judging that only a single hope of salvation was left in this miserable affair,
ordered his mean to seize all of the nearby hills and to carry the battle standards there.

But Saburra's calvary anticipated this and got to them first.

Then truly our men reached their utmost desperation.
Some of them were kill fleeing from the calvary,
while some fell from exhaustion rather than from wounds.

Gnaus Domitius, the commander of his horse, urged Curio
to try for his safety in flight and make for camp, escorted by a few horsemen,
and promised that he himself would not withdraw.

But Curio never self his army having been lost,
which he'd accepted from Caesar as a commission of loyalty,
in his sight ought to turn back he asserted and so fighting he was killed.

the cavalry out of the battle very few retreated; but they, >whom to
newest/freshest/most rearward column of horse for the sake of restoring to have
halted was revealed,
flight of the entire army far off observed selves unharmed into camp they
collected. 

The soldiers were killed to a man.
