42.1 Curio, ubi perterritis omnibus neque cohortationes suas neque preces audiri intellegit,
 unam ut in miseris rebus spem reliquam salutis esse arbitratus,
 proximos colles capere universos atque eo signa inferri iubet.
Hos quoque praeoccupat missus a Saburra equitatus.
Tum vero ad summam desperationem nostri perveniunt et partim fugientes ab
equitatu interficiuntur, partim integri procumbunt.
Hortatur Curionem Cn. Domitius, praefectus equitum,
cum paucis equitibus circumsistens,
ut fuga salutem petat atque in castra contendat,
et se ab eo non discessurum pollicetur.
At Curio numquam se amisso exercitu,
quem a Caesare fidei commissum acceperit,
in eius conspectum reversurum confirmat atque ita proelians interficitur.
Equites ex proelio perpauci se recipiunt;
sed ei, quos ad novissimum agmen equorum reficiendorum causa substitisse
demonstratum est,
fuga totius exercitus procul animadversa sese incolumes in castra conferunt.
Milites ad unum omnes interficiuntur.

Curio, when he realized neither his exhortations nor entreaties were being heard
by any of his panicked men,
believing that just one hope of salvation was left in this miserable affair,
ordered his mean to seize all of the nearby hills and to carry the battle standards there.
But Saburra's calvary anticipated this and got to them first.
Then truly our men reached their utmost desperation.
Some of them were killed fleeing from the calvary,
while others fell from exhaustion rather than from wounds.
Gnaus Domitius, the commander of Curio's horse, urged him
to try for safety in flight and to make for camp, escorted by a few horsemen,
and promised that he himself would not withdraw.
But Curio declared that he would never, after losing the army
that he'd accepted from Caesar as a commission of loyalty,
return to his presence, and so died fighting.
Very few of the cavalry retired from the battle;
but the ones who had stopped to rest (as we have already mentioned),
after observing the flight of the entire army from a distance,
joined up in camp without harm. 
The infantry were killed to a man.
