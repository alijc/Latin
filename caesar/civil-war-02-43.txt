43.1
His rebus cognitis Marcius Rufus quaestor in castris relictus a Curione
cohortatur suos, ne animo deficiant.

Illi orant atque obsecrant, ut in Siciliam navibus reportentur.

Pollicetur magistrisque imperat navium,
ut primo vespere omnes scaphas ad litus appulsas habeant.

Sed tantus fuit omnium terror,
ut alii adesse copias Iubae dicerent,
alii cum legionibus instare Varum iamque se pulverem venientium cernere,
quarum rerum nihil omnino acciderat,
alii classem hostium celeriter advolaturam suspicarentur.

Itaque perterritis omnibus sibi quisque consulebat.

Qui in classe erant, proficisci properabant.

Horum fuga navium onerariarum magistros incitabat;
pauci lenunculi ad officium imperiumque conveniebant.

Sed tanta erat completis litoribus contentio,
qui potissimum ex magno numero conscenderent,
ut multitudine atque onere nonnulli deprimerentur,
reliqui hoc timore propius adire tardarentur.


When the quaestor Marcius Rufus, whom Curio had left in the camp,
learned of these matters, he admonished his men to not lose heart.

They begged and entreated him to let them sail back to Sicily.

Their commander promised this and commanded all of the ships' boats
to be brought to shore by nightfall.

But the general panic was so great that
some men said that Juba's troops were near at hand,
while others thought that he was already threatening Varus with his legions,
when nothing of the sort had happened,
and still others supposed that the enemy fleet was speeding towards them.

And so, with everyone in a panic, each man took his own counsel.

And those who were with the fleet made haste to depart.

The flight of these transports enraged the officers,
and they commanded a few skiffs into service.

But such was the scramble along whole shore,
and so many clambered aboard them,
that a few were overloaded and sank,
and the rest were held off-shore for fear of this happening to them.
