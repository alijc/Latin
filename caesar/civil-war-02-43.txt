43.1
His rebus cognitis Marcius Rufus quaestor in castris relictus a Curione
cohortatur suos, ne animo deficiant.

Illi orant atque obsecrant, ut in Siciliam navibus reportentur.

Pollicetur magistrisque imperat navium,
ut primo vespere omnes scaphas ad litus appulsas habeant.

Sed tantus fuit omnium terror,
ut alii adesse copias Iubae dicerent,
alii cum legionibus instare Varum iamque se pulverem venientium cernere,
quarum rerum nihil omnino acciderat,
alii classem hostium celeriter advolaturam suspicarentur.

Itaque perterritis omnibus sibi quisque consulebat.

Qui in classe erant, proficisci properabant.

Horum fuga navium onerariarum magistros incitabat;
pauci lenunculi ad officium imperiumque conveniebant.

Sed tanta erat completis litoribus contentio,
qui potissimum ex magno numero conscenderent,
ut multitudine atque onere nonnulli deprimerentur,
reliqui hoc timore propius adire tardarentur.


When the quaestor Marcius Rufus, whom Curio had left in the camp,
learned of these matters, he admonished his men to not lose heart.

They begged and prayed to be carried back to Sicily on ships.

The chief promised and commanded of ships,
to have at nightfall all skiffs landed on shore.

But the general panic was so great that
some said that Juba's troops were near at hand,
while others thought that he was already chasing Varus with his legions
when nothing of the sort had happened,
and still others supposed that the enemy fleet was speeding towards them.

And so, with everyone in a panic, each man took his own counsel.

And those who were with the fleet, hurried to depart.

the flight of these transports enraged the officers;
they assembled a few skiffs to duty and command.

But such was the competition to/by the full seashore,
those who might board >strongest/principally from great number,
so that many but to/by cargo several were forced down/sank,
the rest by this fear nearer to approach were hindered.
