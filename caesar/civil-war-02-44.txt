44.1 Quibus rebus accidit,
ut pauci milites patresque familiae,
qui aut gratia aut misericordia valerent aut naves adnare possent,
recepti in Siciliam incolumes pervenirent.

Reliquae copiae missis ad Varum noctu legatorum numero centurionibus sese ei
dediderunt.

Quarum cohortium milites postero die ante oppidum Iuba conspicatus suam esse
 praedicans praedam magnam partem eorum interfici iussit,
 paucos electos in regnum remisit,
 cum Varus suam fidem ab eo laedi quereretur neque resistere auderet.

Ipse equo in oppidum vectus prosequentibus compluribus senatoribus,
quo in numero erat Ser. Sulpicius et Licinius Damasippus paucis diebus
quae fieri vellet,
Uticae constituit atque imperavit
diebusque post paucis se in regnum cum omnibus copiis recepit.


From this it came about that only a few soldiers and heads of household,
those who had prevailed through either friendship or pity,
or were able to swim to the ships, reached Sicily.

The rest of the troops surrendered to Varus, after a number of officers and
centurions treated with him overnight.

When, on the next day Juba inspected the soldiers of these cohorts
before the town, he declared that they were his spoils of war
and ordered most of them to be killed, sending only a few selected men back to
his kingdom.
Varus grumbled that his own credibility was injured by this,
but dared not oppose him.

He himself rode into town, escorted by many senators, two of whom were
Servius Sulpicius and Licinius Damasippus,
after a few days that he wished to happen,
of Utica he set up and commanded,
and after a few days withdrew to Juba's kingdom with all his forces.
