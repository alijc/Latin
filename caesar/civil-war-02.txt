15.1
Trebonius ea, quae sunt amissa,
multo majore militum studio administrare et reficere instituit.
Nam ubi tantos suos labores et apparatus male cecidisse viderunt
indutiisque per scelus violatis suam virtutem irrisui fore perdoluerunt,
quod, unde agger omnino comportari posset, nihil erat reliquum,
omnibus arboribus longe lateque in finibus Massiliensium excisis et convectis,
aggerem novi generis atque inauditum ex latericiis duobus muris senum pedum
crassitudine atque eorum murorum contignatione facere instituerunt aequa fere
altitudine, atque ille congesticius ex materia fuerat agger.
Ubi aut spatium inter muros aut imbecillitas materiae postulare videretur, pilae
interponuntur, traversaria tigna iniciuntur, quae firmamento esse possint, et
quicquid est contignatum cratibus consternitur, crates luto integuntur.
Sub tecto miles dextra ac sinistra muro tectus, adversus plutei obiectu, operi
quaecumque sunt usui sine periculo supportat.
Celeriter res administratur;
diuturni laboris detrimentum sollertia et virtute militum brevi reconciliatur.
Portae, quibus locis videtur, eruptionis causa in muro relinquuntur.


Trebonius decided to take charge of and repair what had been lost, to the utter enthusiasm of his soldiers.  For when they saw how much of their work and preparations had crashed and burned, they grieved that their manliness would be made a laughingstock by the heinous act that had violated the truce.  Because there was nothing at all left to rebuild the rampart, as all trees far and wide within the boundaries of Massalla had been cut down and collected, they decided to make a completely new sort of rampart out of two brick walls six feet thick, with roof beams, raised to nearly the same height as the one that had been made of wood.  Where either the space between the walls or weakness of the wood seemed to need it, they inserted piers and cross-beams to serve as supports, and whatever was joined was covered first with latticework, and then with clay.  A soldier was protected overhead by the covering, on the right and left by a wall, and in front by a breastwork that had been thrown up, carried in the materials for use in the work without danger.  The matter was managed quickly; the loss of their long labor was soon restored through the skill and strength of the soldiers.  They left gates in the wall, in which places that seemed right, for sorties.
