1.1 Dictatore habente comitia Caesare consules creantur Iulius Caesar et
P. Servilius:
is enim erat annus, quo per leges ei consulem fieri liceret.

His rebus confectis,
cum fides tota Italia esset angustior neque creditae pecuniae solverentur,
constituit, ut arbitri darentur;
per eos fierent aestimationes possessionum et rerum,
quanti quaeque earum ante bellum fuisset,
atque eae creditoribus traderentur.

Hoc et ad timorem novarum tabularum tollendum minuendumve,
qui fere bella et civiles dissensiones sequi consuevit,
et ad debitorum tuendam existimationem esse aptissimum existimavit.

Itemque praetoribus tribunisque plebis rogationes ad populum ferentibus
nonnullos ambitus Pompeia lege damnatos illis temporibus,
quibus in urbe praesidia legionum Pompeius habuerat,
quae iudicia aliis audientibus iudicibus,
aliis sententiam ferentibus singulis diebus erant perfecta,
in integrum restituit,
qui se illi initio civilis belli obtulerant,
si sua opera in bello uti vellet,
proinde aestimans, ac si usus esset,
quoniam sui fecissent potestatem.

Statuerat enim prius hos iudicio populi debere restitui,
quam suo beneficio videri receptos,
ne aut ingratus in referenda gratia aut arrogans in praeripiendo
populi beneficio videretur.


The dictator Caesar held an assembly,
and Julius Caesar and P Servilius were appointed as consuls;
for it was the year in which it was permitted by law for him to become a consul.

After these matters were accomplished,
since credit was constricted all over Italy,
and loans were not being repaid,
he established for judgements to be made;
through these valuations of possessions and property could be made
of however great they had been before the war,
and for them to be handed over to their creditors.

He, who was accustomed to follow wars and civil disagreements closely,
reckoned that this was the best course of action,
in respect to the fear of new contracts that might be either raised or reduced
and in regards to an examined estimation of debtors.

Likewise, the request by the praetors, tribunes and plebs to the people
by bringing a few bribes? that had been condemned by Pompey's law in
those times,
through which Pompey had held a garrison of legions in the city,
with trials being heard by some judges,
while others brought in sentences on each day they were completed,
he restored to integrity,
those who themselves had caused the onset of the civil war,
if he wanted to use his service in the war,
then assessing, and if he had made use of it,
since his men had made him a ruler.

For he had earlier established by the judgment of the people that these men
had to restore what they'd recovered by their own service to seem,
lest he seem either ungrateful in rendering favor or
arrogant in snatching the people's benefit away.
