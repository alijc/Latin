1.1 Dictatore habente comitia Caesare consules creantur Iulius Caesar et
P. Servilius:
is enim erat annus, quo per leges ei consulem fieri liceret.

His rebus confectis,
cum fides tota Italia esset angustior neque creditae pecuniae solverentur,
constituit, ut arbitri darentur;
per eos fierent aestimationes possessionum et rerum,
quanti quaeque earum ante bellum fuisset,
atque eae creditoribus traderentur.

Hoc et ad timorem novarum tabularum tollendum minuendumve,
qui fere bella et civiles dissensiones sequi consuevit,
et ad debitorum tuendam existimationem esse aptissimum existimavit.

Itemque praetoribus tribunisque plebis rogationes ad populum ferentibus
nonnullos ambitus Pompeia lege damnatos illis temporibus,
quibus in urbe praesidia legionum Pompeius habuerat,
quae iudicia aliis audientibus iudicibus,
aliis sententiam ferentibus singulis diebus erant perfecta,
in integrum restituit,
qui se illi initio civilis belli obtulerant,
si sua opera in bello uti vellet,
proinde aestimans, ac si usus esset,
quoniam sui fecissent potestatem.

Statuerat enim prius hos iudicio populi debere restitui,
quam suo beneficio videri receptos,
ne aut ingratus in referenda gratia aut arrogans in praeripiendo
populi beneficio videretur.


having a dictator, an assembly, Julius Caesar and P Servilius,
was appointed by Caesar:
for it was the year in which through laws to him >consul to be made it was
allowed.

These matters having been accomplished,
when confidence all Italy was more disturbed and not of trust/loans of money
paid back,
he resolved that judgements be given;
through them they might be made/come about valuations of property and
possessions,
whatever the size of which had been before the war,
and they to creditors might have been surrendered.

This and to dread of new records? about to be raised/destroyed or reduced,
he who nearly wars and civil disagreements to follow he accustomed (himself),
and to of debts the upheld opinion to be most proper he judged.

Likewise to/by the praetors and tribunes and plebs the proposed measures to the
people to/by bringing >some men found guilty of the circuit by Pompey's law in
those times,
by/to whom in the city the protection/garrison of the legions Pompey had held,
which trials to/by other listening judges,
to/by others bringing sentences on every day they were completed,
into sound he restored,
he who self to that beginning of the civil war they had caused,
if one's work in the war to use he might wish,
hence assessing, and if he might have used,
since his men might have made/done power.

For he had established earlier these men to/by trial of the people
to owe to restore,
>which to/by his own favor to seem >those accepted,
lest either ungrateful in rendering favor or arrogance in snatching it away
of the people the kindness might seem.
