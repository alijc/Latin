2.1 His rebus et feriis Latinis comitiisque omnibus perficiendis XI dies tribuit
 dictaturaque se abdicat et ab urbe proficiscitur Brundisiumque pervenit.

Eo legiones XII, equitatum omnem venire iusserat.

Sed tantum navium repperit,
ut anguste XV milia legionariorum militum,
DC equites transportari possent.

Hoc unum Caesari ad celeritatem conficiendi belli defuit.

Atque hae ipsae copiae hoc infrequentiores imponuntur,
quod multi Gallicis tot bellis defecerant,
longumque iter ex Hispania magnum numerum deminuerat,
et gravis autumnus in Apulia circumque Brundisium ex saluberrimis Galliae et Hispaniae regionibus omnem exercitum valetudine temptaverat.

After the completion of these events, and of the Latin holidays, and of all
the committee meetings,
he allotted 11 days and then
resigned from the dictatorship, left the city and reached Brundisium.

He had ordered 12 legions and all of the cavalry to come there.

But he discovered only enough ships to transport, in close quarters, 
15 thousand legionary soliders and 600 horses.

This was the only thing that kept Caesar from quickly preparing for war.

And these same troops were under-manned,
because they'd lost so many men in the Gallic wars,
and the long march from Spain had weakened a great number of them,
and the harsh autumn weather in Apulia and around Brundisium
tried the soundness of the whole army,
used to the wholesome regions of Gaul and Spain.
