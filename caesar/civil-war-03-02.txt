2.1 His rebus et feriis Latinis comitiisque omnibus perficiendis XI dies tribuit
 dictaturaque se abdicat et ab urbe proficiscitur Brundisiumque pervenit.

Eo legiones XII, equitatum omnem venire iusserat.

Sed tantum navium repperit,
ut anguste XV milia legionariorum militum,
DC equites transportari possent.

Hoc unum Caesari ad celeritatem conficiendi belli defuit.

Atque hae ipsae copiae hoc infrequentiores imponuntur,
quod multi Gallicis tot bellis defecerant,
longumque iter ex Hispania magnum numerum deminuerat,
et gravis autumnus in Apulia circumque Brundisium ex saluberrimis Galliae et Hispaniae regionibus omnem exercitum valetudine temptaverat.


these things and Roman festivals have taken place and completed by everyone,
for 11 days he allotted and
resigned from the dictatorship and departed the city and reached Brundisium.

He had ordered 12 legions and all of the cavalry to come there.

But he discovered only enough ships to transport, in close quarters, 
15 thousand legionary soliders and 600 horses.

This was the only thing that kept Caesar from quickly preparing for war.

And these selfsame troops by this below strength were imposed,
that/because many to/by Gallic so many wars had died(?),
and the long march from Spain had weakened a great number,
and heavy autumn in Apulia and around Brundisium out of the wholesome regions of
Gaul and Spain tried the soundnes of the whole army.
