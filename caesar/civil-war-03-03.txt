3.1 Pompeius annuum spatium ad comparandas copias nactus,

magnam omnibus locis aedificandam curaverat;
magnam imperatam Asiae,
Syriae regibusque omnibus et dynastis et tetrarchis et liberis Achaiae populis
pecuniam exegerat,
magnam societates earum provinciarum, quas ipse obtinebat,
sibi numerare coegerat.
