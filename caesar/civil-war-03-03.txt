3.1 Pompeius annuum spatium ad comparandas copias nactus,
quod vacuum a bello atque ab hoste otiosum fuerat,
magnam ex Asia Cycladibusque insulis, Corcyra, Athenis, Ponto, Bithynia, Syria,
Cilicia, Phoenice, Aegypto classem coegerat,
magnam omnibus locis aedificandam curaverat;
magnam imperatam Asiae,
Syriae regibusque omnibus et dynastis et tetrarchis et liberis Achaiae populis
pecuniam exegerat,
magnam societates earum provinciarum, quas ipse obtinebat,
sibi numerare coegerat.


Pompey, having obtained the space of a year for preparing his troops,
because he hadn't been occupied by either war or an enemy,
had gatthered a large fleet from Asia and the Cyclades islands, Corcyra, Athens,
Pontus, Bithynia, Syria, Cilicia, Phoenicia and Egypt.
He'd undertaken great construction in all these places;
had exacted a great levy of money from Asia and Syria,
and all the kings and rulers and tetrarchs and free populations of Achaia,
and had 
and had convened great .. alliances of their provinces,
which he himself held,
to self to count up.
