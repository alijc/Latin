Legiones effecerat civium Romanorum VIIII: V ex Italia, quas traduxerat;
unam ex Cilicia veteranam, quam factam ex duabus gemellam appellabat;
unam ex Creta et Macedonia ex veteranis militibus,
qui dimissi a superioribus imperatoribus in his provinciis consederant;
duas ex Asia, quas Lentulus consul conscribendas curaverat.

Praeterea magnum numerum ex Thessalia, Boeotia, Achaia Epiroque supplementi
 nomine in legiones distribuerat:
 his Antonianos milites admiscuerat.

Praeter has exspectabat cum Scipione ex Syria legiones II.

Sagittarios Creta, Lacedaemone,
ex Ponto atque Syria reliquisque civitatibus III milia numero habebat,
funditorum cohortes sexcenarias II, equitum VII milia.

Ex quibus DC Gallos Deiotarus adduxerat, D Ariobarzanes ex Cappadocia;
ad eundem numerum Cotys ex Thracia dederat et Sadalam filium miserat;
ex Macedonia CC erant, quibus Rhascypolis praeerat, excellenti virtute;
D ex Gabinianis Alexandria, Gallos Germanosque,
quos ibi A. Gabinius praesidii causa apud regem Ptolomaeum reliquerat,
Pompeius filius cum classe adduxerat;
DCCC ex servis suis pastorumque suorum numero coegerat;
CCC Tarcondarius Castor et Domnilaus ex Gallograecia dederant
(horum alter una venerat, alter filium miserat);
CC ex Syria a Commageno Antiocho, cui magna Pompeius praemia tribuit,
missi erant, in his plerique hippotoxotae.

Huc Dardanos, Bessos partim mercenarios, partim imperio aut gratia comparatos,
item Macedones, Thessalos ac reliquarum gentium et civitatum adiecerat
atque eum, quem supra demonstravimus, numerum expleverat.


He ended up with 9 legions of Roman citizens: 5 that he'd brought over from
Italy;
a battle-tested one from Cilica, that he had combined from two similar ones;
one from Crete and Macedonia, made up of experienced soldiers,
who had settled in these provinces after being demobilized by their previous commanders;
and two from Asia, whose enlistment the consul Lentulus had procured.

In addition he assigned a great number of reinforcements from Thessalia,
Boeotia, Achaia and Epirus into the rolls of the army:
he had mixed Antony's soldiers in with these.

Besides these he and Scipio were expecting 2 legions from Syria.

He had 3000 archers from Crete, Sparta, Pontus and Syria and the other cities,
1200 cohorts of slingers, and 700 horse.

Deiotarus had added 600 Gauls from these places,
Ariobarzanes 500 from Cappadocia;
Cotys had given about the same number from Thrace and had sent his son Sadala;
there were 200 Macedonians, distinguished in courage and led by Rhascypolis,

500 from Gabinius in Alexandria, Gauls and Germans,
that A. Gabinius had left there to protect King Ptolomy,

Pompey, Jr had come with a fleet;
he had collected 800 of his own slaves and a number of his herdsmen;
Tarcondarius Castor and Domnilaus had given 300 from Galatia
(of these two one had come with the troops, and the other had sent his son);
200 had been sent from Syria by Commagenus Antiochus,
to whom Pompey conferred a large reward, most of these were mounted archers.

Here he had added Dardanians, Bessians, partly mercenaries,
partly procured by command or by favor,
and also Macedonians, Thessalians and the rest of the
tribes and cities
and >him, whom we have already shown, filled out the number.
