Legiones effecerat civium Romanorum VIIII: V ex Italia, quas traduxerat;
unam ex Cilicia veteranam, quam factam ex duabus gemellam appellabat;
unam ex Creta et Macedonia ex veteranis militibus,
qui dimissi a superioribus imperatoribus in his provinciis consederant;
duas ex Asia, quas Lentulus consul conscribendas curaverat.

Praeterea magnum numerum ex Thessalia, Boeotia, Achaia Epiroque supplementi
 nomine in legiones distribuerat:
 his Antonianos milites admiscuerat.

Praeter has exspectabat cum Scipione ex Syria legiones II.

Sagittarios Creta, Lacedaemone,
ex Ponto atque Syria reliquisque civitatibus III milia numero habebat,
funditorum cohortes sexcenarias II, equitum VII milia.

Ex quibus DC Gallos Deiotarus adduxerat, D Ariobarzanes ex Cappadocia;
ad eundem numerum Cotys ex Thracia dederat et Sadalam filium miserat;
ex Macedonia CC erant, quibus Rhascypolis praeerat, excellenti virtute;
D ex Gabinianis Alexandria, Gallos Germanosque,
quos ibi A. Gabinius praesidii causa apud regem Ptolomaeum reliquerat,
Pompeius filius cum classe adduxerat;
DCCC ex servis suis pastorumque suorum numero coegerat;
CCC Tarcondarius Castor et Domnilaus ex Gallograecia dederant
(horum alter una venerat, alter filium miserat);
CC ex Syria a Commageno Antiocho, cui magna Pompeius praemia tribuit,
missi erant, in his plerique hippotoxotae.

Huc Dardanos, Bessos partim mercenarios, partim imperio aut gratia comparatos,
item Macedones, Thessalos ac reliquarum gentium et civitatum adiecerat
atque eum, quem supra demonstravimus, numerum expleverat.


He ended up with 9 legions of Roman citizens: 5 that he'd brought over from
Italy; a veteran one from Sicily, that he'd asked to be formed from two twinned;
one from Crete and Macedonia, made up of experienced soldiers,
who, after being demobilized by their former commanders,
had settled in these provinces;
two from Asia, whose enlistment consul Lentulus had procured.

In addition he assigned a great number of reinforcements from Thessalia,
Boeotia, Achaia and Epirus into the rolls of the army:
he had mixed these Antonian soldiers in.

Besides these he expected/awaited with Scipio 2 legions from Syria.

He had 3000 archers from Crete, Sparta, Pontus and Syria and the other cities,
1200 cohorts of slingers, and 700 horse.

of which 600 Gauls Deiotarus had added, 500 Ariobarzanes from Cappadocia;
about the same number of Cotys from Thrace he had yeilds and had sent his son
Sadala;
there were 200, distinguished in courage, from Macedonia, which were led by
Rhascypolis,
500 from Gabinius in Alexandria, Gauls and Germans,
who there from Gabinius for a garrison near King Ptolomy he had left,
Pompey son had added with fleet????
he had collected 800 of his own slaves and a number of his herdsmen;
Tarcondarius Castor and Domnilaus from Gallograecia had given 300
(of these one had come along with, the other had sent his son);
200 from Syria by Commagenus Antioch, to whom Pompey assigned a reward,
had been sent, in these the most of mounted archers.

Here he had added Darnanians, Bessians, partly mercenaries, partly state or
provided for free, likewise the Macedonians, the Thessalians and the rest of the
tribes and cities
and >him, whom above we have shown, filled out the number.
