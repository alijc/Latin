6.1 Caesar, ut Brundisium venit, contionatus apud milites, quoniam prope ad
finem laborum ac periculorum esset perventum, aequo animo mancipia atque
impedimenta in Italia relinquerent, ipsi expediti naves conscenderent, quo
maior numerus militum posset imponi, omniaque ex victoria et ex sua
liberalitate sperarent, conclamantibus omnibus, imperaret, quod vellet,
quodcumque imperavisset, se aequo animo esse facturos, II. Non. Ian. naves
solvit.  Impositae, ut supra demonstratum est, legiones VII.  Postridie
terram attigit.  Inter Cerauniorum saxa et alia loca periculosa quietam
nactus stationem et portus omnes timens, quos teneri ab adversariis
arbitrabatur, ad eum locum, qui appellabatur Palaeste, omnibus navibus ad
unam incolumibus milites exposuit.


When Caesar reached Brindisi he addressed his troops, telling them that the
end of their labors and dangers was at hand, that they could leave their
goods and baggage in Italy with an easy mind, that they'd board the ships
without baggage so that more soldiers could be loaded, and that they should
put their trust in victory and in his own generosity.  When everyone shouted
in acclamation he could have given any order that he wished.  He, with an
easy mind himself for what was to come, set sail on 2 Nones January.  There
were 7 legions that boarded, as shown above.  On the next day he reached
land.  After finding an uncontested beachhead between the Ceraunian rocks
and other dangerous places, and apprehensive of all harbors, because they
were thought to be held by the enemy, he landed the soldiers at the place
called Palaeste, with all the ships, to a one, undamaged.
