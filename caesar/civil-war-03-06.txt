Caesar, ut Brundisium venit,
contionatus apud milites,
quoniam prope ad finem laborum ac periculorum esset perventum,
aequo animo mancipia atque impedimenta in Italia relinquerent,
ipsi expediti naves conscenderent,
quo maior numerus militum posset imponi,
omniaque ex victoria et ex sua liberalitate sperarent,
conclamantibus omnibus,
imperaret,
quod vellet,
quodcumque imperavisset,
se aequo animo esse facturos, II. Non. Ian. naves solvit.

Inter Cerauniorum saxa et alia loca periculosa quietam nactus stationem et portus omnes timens, quos teneri ab adversariis arbitrabatur, ad eum locum, qui appellabatur Palaeste, omnibus navibus ad unam incolumibus milites exposuit.
