7.1 Erat Orici Lucretius Vespillo et Minucius Rufus cum Asiaticis
navibus XVIII, quibus iussu D. Laelii praeerant, M. Bibulus cum
navibus ex Corcyrae.  Sed neque illi sibi confisi ex portu prodire
sunt ausi, cum Caesar omnino XII naves longas praesidio duxisset, in
quibus erant constratae IIII, neque Bibulus impeditis navibus
dispersisque remigibus satis mature occurrit, quod prius ad
continentem visus est Caesar, quam de eius adventu fama omnino in eas
regiones perferretur.


Lucretius Vespillo and Minucius Rufus were at Oricos, with 18 Asiatic
ships that D. Laelius had given into their command, and M. Bibulus
with ships from Corcyra.  But Vespillo and Rufus, lacking confidence,
dared not come out of the harbor after Caesar had brought out all 12
of his galleys, 4 of which had decks, as an escort, nor did Bibulus,
with his ships encumbered and his oarsmen scattered, come out to meet
them quickly enough, because Caesar was seen near the mainland before
the news of his approach was at all known in the neighborhood.
