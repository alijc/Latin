Erat Orici Lucretius Vespillo et Minucius Rufus cum Asiaticis navibus XVIII,
quibus iussu D. Laelii praeerant, M. Bibulus cum navibus ex Corcyrae.

Sed neque illi sibi confisi ex portu prodire sunt ausi,
cum Caesar omnino XII naves longas praesidio duxisset,
in quibus erant constratae IIII,
neque Bibulus impeditis navibus dispersisque remigibus satis mature occurrit,
quod prius ad continentem visus est Caesar,
quam de eius adventu fama omnino in eas regiones perferretur.


There was ??? ?? Minucius Rufus with 8 Asian ships,
which they commanded by D Laelius's order,
M Bibulus with the ships from Corcyra.

But they, lacking confidence, didn't dare issue from the harbor,
when Caesar with all 12 galleys had led/commanded to/by the garrison,
in which there were 4 decked ships,
nor did Bibulus, with encumbered ships and scattered oarsmen, run to meet them
quickly enough,
because first to the mainland Caesar seemed,
than from his approach the rumor entirely in his neighborhoods he might bear.
