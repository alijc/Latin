Erat Orici Lucretius Vespillo et Minucius Rufus cum Asiaticis navibus XVIII,
quibus iussu D. Laelii praeerant, M. Bibulus cum navibus ex Corcyrae.

Sed neque illi sibi confisi ex portu prodire sunt ausi,
cum Caesar omnino XII naves longas praesidio duxisset,
in quibus erant constratae IIII,
neque Bibulus impeditis navibus dispersisque remigibus satis mature occurrit,
quod prius ad continentem visus est Caesar,
quam de eius adventu fama omnino in eas regiones perferretur.


There were
Lucretius Vespillo of Oricos and Minucius Rufus with 8 ships from Asia,
which they had command of by D. Laelius's order,
and M. Bibulus with the ships from Corcyra.

But they, lacking confidence, dared not come out of the harbor
after Caesar had brought out all 12 of his galleys, 4 of which had decks, as
an escort, 
nor did Bibulus, with his ships encumbered and his oarsmen scattered,
come out to meet them quickly enough,
because at first Caesar seemed to be headed for the mainland,
which the news of his approach was being carried entirely through the regions.
