8.1
Expositis militibus naves eadem nocte Brundisium a Caesare remittuntur,
ut reliquae legiones equitatusque transportari possent.
Huic officio praepositus erat Fufius Calenus legatus,
qui celeritatem in transportandis legionibus adhiberet.
Sed serius a terra provectae naves neque usae nocturna aura in redeundo
offenderunt.
Bibulus enim Corcyrae certior factus de adventu Caesaris,
sperans alicui se parti onustarum navium occurrere posse,
inanibus occurrit et nactus circiter XXX in eas indiligentiae suae
ac doloris iracundiam erupit omnesque incendit eodemque igne nautas
dominosque navium interfecit,
magnitudine poenae reliquos terreri sperans.

Hoc confecto negotio a Sasonis ad Curici portum stationes
litoraque omnia longe lateque classibus occupavit
custodiisque diligentius dispositis ipse gravissima hieme in navibus excubans
neque ullum laborem aut munus despiciens,
neque subsidium exspectans si in Caesaris complexum venire posset . . 


After the soldiers were disembarked, Caesar sent the same ships back to
Brundisiumin in the night, 
so that the rest of the legions and cavalry could be transported.

The officer Fufius Calenus had been placed in command of this duty.
He might summon speed in transporting to/by the legions.

But the ships sailed away from land too late and did not encounter the nocturnal
wind in their return.

For when Bibulus of Corcyra was sure about Caesar's arrival,
hoping to anyone/someone that he could intercept to/by role/of gains of the
laden ships,
to/by hollows/empty spaces he ran to meet and, having gotten about 30 in them
(ships?) of his negligence and grief burst out in anger
and set fire to them all and with the same fire killed the sailors and (ship?)
masters, hoping, by the magnitude of the punishment, to deter the rest.

When this business was finished,
he used his fleets to seize the outposts and all the landing places far and
wide, from Sason.. to the harbor of Curicum,
and to/by guards more carefully stationed he himself in the fierce winter to/by
ships keeping watch
neither overlooking any labor or duty,
nor expecting relief if he chanced to enter Caesar's embrace.
