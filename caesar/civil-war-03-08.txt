8.1
Expositis militibus naves eadem nocte Brundisium a Caesare remittuntur,
ut reliquae legiones equitatusque transportari possent.
Huic officio praepositus erat Fufius Calenus legatus,
qui celeritatem in transportandis legionibus adhiberet.
Sed serius a terra provectae naves neque usae nocturna aura in redeundo
offenderunt.
Bibulus enim Corcyrae certior factus de adventu Caesaris,
sperans alicui se parti onustarum navium occurrere posse,
inanibus occurrit et nactus circiter XXX in eas indiligentiae suae
ac doloris iracundiam erupit omnesque incendit eodemque igne nautas
dominosque navium interfecit,
magnitudine poenae reliquos terreri sperans.
Hoc confecto negotio a Sasonis ad Curici portum stationes
litoraque omnia longe lateque classibus occupavit
custodiisque diligentius dispositis ipse gravissima hieme in navibus excubans
neque ullum laborem aut munus despiciens,
neque subsidium exspectans si in Caesaris complexum venire posset . . 


After landing the soldiers, Caesar sent the same ships back to
Brundisiumin in the night, 
so that the rest of the legions and the cavalry could be transported.

The officer Fufius Calenus had been placed in command of this business,
to apply speed in transporting the legions.

But the ships, as they'd set sail from land too late to profit from
the nocturnal wind, failed to return.

For when Bibulus of Corcyra was sure about Caesar's arrival,
hoping that he could intercept some portion of the laden ships,
rushed into empty seas and, having stumbling upon about 30 in them
(ships?) burst out in anger of his negligence and grief 
and set fire to them all.
And in that fire he killed the sailors and (ship?) masters,
hoping, by the magnitude of the punishment, to deter the rest.

When this business was finished,
he used his fleets to seize the outposts and all the landing places far and
wide, from Saso to the harbor of Curicum,
and, after carefully stationing garrisons,
he himself kept watch among the ships during the fierce winter,
neither overlooking any labor or duty,
nor expecting relief if he chanced to fall into Caesar's embrace.
