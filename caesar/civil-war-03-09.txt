9.1
Discessu Liburnarum ex Illyrico M. Octavius cum eis, quas habebat, navibus Salonas pervenit.
Ibi concitatis Dalmatis reliquisque barbaris Issam a Caesaris amicitia avertit;
conventum Salonis cum neque pollicitationibus neque denuntiatione periculi
permovere posset, oppidum oppugnare instituit.
Est autem oppidum et loci natura et colle munitum.
Sed celeriter cives Romani ligneis effectis turribus his sese munierunt et,
cum essent infirmi ad resistendum propter paucitatem hominum crebris confecti
vulneribus,
ad extremum auxilium descenderunt servosque omnes puberes liberaverunt et
praesectis omnium mulierum crinibus tormenta effecerunt.
Quorum cognita sententia Octavius quinis castris oppidum circumdedit atque uno
tempore obsidione et oppugnationibus eos premere coepit.
Illi omnia perpeti parati maxime a re frumentaria laborabant.
Cui rei missis ad Caesarem legatis auxilium ab eo petebant;
reliqua, ut poterant, incommoda per se sustinebant.
Et longo interposito spatio cum diuturnitas oppugnationis neglegentiores Octavianos effecisset,
nacti occasionem meridiani temporis discessu eorum pueris mulieribusque in muro dispositis,
ne quid cotidianae consuetudinis desideraretur,
ipsi manu facta cum eis,
quos nuper liberaverant,
in proxima Octavii castra irruperunt.
His expugnatis eodem impetu altera sunt adorti,
inde tertia et quarta et deinceps reliqua omnibusque eos castris expulerunt et
magno numero interfecto reliquos atque ipsum Octavium in naves confugere
coegerunt.
Hic fuit oppugnationis exitus.
Iamque hiems appropinquabat,
et tantis detrimentis acceptis Octavius desperata oppugnatione oppidi Dyrrachium sese ad Pompeium recepit.


On the departure of the Liburian ships from Illyricum,
M. Octavius came to Salonae with the ships that he had.
After agitating the Dalmatians and the rest of the foreigners there,
he turned the island of Issa away from an alliance with Caesar;
When he couldn't persuade the Salonian assembly, either through promises or
declarations of their peril, he prepared to attack the town. 
Now this town is protected, both by the nature of the place and by a hill.
But the Roman citizens threw up wooden towers and manned them themselves and,
since their defense was feeble, on account of the scarcity of men through
having been used up with frequent wounds,
they stooped to using outside help and liberated all adults (slaves?) and
built a catapult, after cutting the hair of every woman.
When he understood their purpose, Octavius surrounded the town with five camps,
and began to press them with both a siege and assaults at the same time.
They, prepared to suffer everything,
were greatly troubled about their grain supply.
For which reason they sent envoys to Caesar and begged him for aid;
they were sustaining themselves with their other troubles as best they could.

And after a long stretch of time, when the duration of the siege made Octavius'
troops less careful, 

they got an opportunity in the middle of the day, when the boys and women
who were stationed on the wall left to deal with their daily needs,
they made up a band of men from the ones that had been so recently liberated,
and penetrated into the vicinity of Octavius' camp.

After storming the camp, they assailed the next one in the same attack,
and then the third and the fourth and the last in turn driving them out of the
camps.  They killed a great number they compelled the rest, including Octavius
himself, to flee to their ships.

This was the end of the assault.

And now with winter approaching after having received such defeats, Octavius
recovered the town of Dyrrachium for Pompey by a desparate assault.
