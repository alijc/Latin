9.1
Discessu Liburnarum ex Illyrico M. Octavius cum eis, quas habebat, navibus Salonas pervenit.
Ibi concitatis Dalmatis reliquisque barbaris Issam a Caesaris amicitia avertit;
conventum Salonis cum neque pollicitationibus neque denuntiatione periculi
permovere posset, oppidum oppugnare instituit.
Est autem oppidum et loci natura et colle munitum.
Sed celeriter cives Romani ligneis effectis turribus his sese munierunt et,
cum essent infirmi ad resistendum propter paucitatem hominum crebris confecti
vulneribus,
ad extremum auxilium descenderunt servosque omnes puberes liberaverunt et
praesectis omnium mulierum crinibus tormenta effecerunt.
Quorum cognita sententia Octavius quinis castris oppidum circumdedit atque uno
tempore obsidione et oppugnationibus eos premere coepit.
Illi omnia perpeti parati maxime a re frumentaria laborabant.
Cui rei missis ad Caesarem legatis auxilium ab eo petebant;
reliqua, ut poterant, incommoda per se sustinebant.
Et longo interposito spatio cum diuturnitas oppugnationis neglegentiores Octavianos effecisset,
nacti occasionem meridiani temporis discessu eorum pueris mulieribusque in muro dispositis,
ne quid cotidianae consuetudinis desideraretur,
ipsi manu facta cum eis,
quos nuper liberaverant,
in proxima Octavii castra irruperunt.

His expugnatis eodem impetu altera sunt adorti,
inde tertia et quarta et deinceps reliqua omnibusque eos castris expulerunt et
magno numero interfecto reliquos atque ipsum Octavium in naves confugere
coegerunt.

Hic fuit oppugnationis exitus.

Iamque hiems appropinquabat,
et tantis detrimentis acceptis Octavius desperata oppugnatione oppidi Dyrrachium sese ad Pompeium recepit.


On the departure of the Liburians from Illyricum,
M. Octavius came to Salonae with the ships that he had.

There having stirred up the Dalmatians and the rest of the foreigners
>Issa by Caesar he turned aside with a treaty/friendship;
having assembled/agreed/>agreement of? Salonae with/when neither promises nor
declaration of danger he could influence, he prepared/started to attack the
town.

Now the town is protected, both by the nature of the place and by a hill.

But quickly the Roman citizens having created wooden towers to/by these selves
fortified  and,
when it was of weak to resisting on account of the scarcity of men to/by
frequent wounds having been expended,
to outside aid they stooped and all adults they liberated and
having cut the hair of every woman, effected a catapult.

When he understood their purpose, Octavius surrounded the town with five camps,
and began to press them with both a siege and assaults at the same time.

They in all respects to/by continous prepared to the max by the grain supply
labored. 

to whom to/of the thing  having sent envoys to Caesar, aid by him they begged;
the rest, as they could, inconvienient by themselves they sustained.

And having interposed a long time when >long durations of siege more heedless
>Octavius' troops might make,
having gotten the chance at midday the departure of them to/by boys and women
who were stationed on the wall,
lest what of daily habit it was required,
to his/they with hand/band made with them,
>whom recently they had liberated,
penetrated into the vicinity of Octavius' camp.

having stormed this, in the same attack others were assailed,
from there the third and fourth and in succession the rest and them from the
camp they drove out and having killed a great number >the rest and Octavius
himself onto the ships to flee they compelled.

Here/this was of/> assaults having sailed away/the departure.

and now winter was approaching,
to/by such defeats having taken, Octavius by a desparate assault of the town
Dyrrachium self to Pompey recovered.
