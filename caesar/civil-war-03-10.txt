10.1 Demonstravimus L. Vibullium Rufum, Pompei praefectum, bis
in potestatem pervenisse Caesaris atque ab eo esse dimissum,
semel ad Corfinium, iterum in Hispania.  Hunc pro suis
beneficiis Caesar idoneum iudicaverat, quem cum mandatis ad
Cn. Pompeium mitteret, eundemque apud Cn. Pompeium auctoritatem
habere intellegebat.  Erat autem haec summa mandatorum: debere
utrumque pertinaciae finem facere et ab armis discedere neque
amplius fortunam periclitari.  Satis esse magna utrimque
incommoda accepta, quae pro disciplina et praeceptis habere
possent, ut reliquos casus timerent: illum Italia expulsum
amissa Sicilia et Sardinia duabusque Hispaniis et cohortibus in
Italia atque Hispania civium Romanorum centum atque XXX; se
morte Curionis et detrimento Africani exercitus tanto militumque
deditione ad Curictam.  Proinde sibi ac rei publicae parcerent,
cum, quantum in bello fortuna posset, iam ipsi incommodis suis
satis essent documento.  Hoc unum esse tempus de pace agendi,
dum sibi uterque confideret et pares ambo viderentur; si vero
alteri paulum modo tribuisset fortuna, non esse usurum
condicionibus pacis eum, qui superior videretur, neque fore
aequa parte contentum, qui se omnia habiturum confideret.
Condiciones pacis, quoniam antea convenire non potuissent, Romae
ab senatu et a populo peti debere.  Interea et rei publicae et
ipsis placere oportere, si uterque in contione statim iuravisset
se triduo proximo exercitum dimissurum.  Depositis armis
auxiliisque, quibus nunc confiderent, necessario populi
senatusque iudicio fore utrumque contentum.  Haec quo facilius
Pompeio probari possent, omnes suas terrestres ubique copias
dimissurum . . .


We have shown that L. Vibullius Rufus, Pompey's commander, had
come into Caesar's power and been released by him twice, once at
Corfinium, and again in Spain.  For these favors Caesar had
judged him to be suitable to be sent to Pompey with commissions,
and understood him to have influence with Pompey.  Now this was
the very height of commissions: That both needed to make an end
of stubbornness and to withdraw from arms and no longer test
fate.  That sufficiently great defeats had been incurred on both
sides, that they would remember as a lesson to fear future
calamities: That Pompey had been driven out of Italy and lost
Sicily and Sardinia and both Spains and one hundred and thirty
cohorts of Roman citizens in Italy and Spain; and he himself by
the death of Curio and the defeat of the African army with such
a surrender of his soldiers at Curicta.  That they therefore
should show consideration to themselves and to the republic,
when they themselves were already, from their defeats, a good
example of whatever fortune might bring in war.  That only this
was the time for urging peace, when each could trust the other,
and they were apparent equals; had fate only granted just a
little bit to the other man, then the one who appeared to have
the upper hand and who had confidence that he could hold on to
everything, would take advantage of the conditions of peace and
wouldn't be content with a equal footing.  That, since it had
not been possible for them to meet ere now, it was necessary to
ask the senate and people of Rome to ratify the conditions of
peace.  In the meantime it behooved both the republic and the
people that each would publicly swear that they would dissolve
their army in the next three days.  By putting aside their
weapons and auxiliaries, which they currently relied on, each
would be, by necessity, content with the judgment of the people
and senate.  In order that these affairs could more be easily
approved by Pompey, all his land troops were to be dismissed...
