100.1 Eodem tempore D. Laelius cum classe ad Brundisium venit
eademque ratione, qua factum a Libone antea demonstravimus,
insulam obiectam portui Brundisino tenuit.  Similiter Vatinius,
qui Brundisio praeerat, tectis instructisque scaphis elicuit
naves Laelianas atque ex his longius productam unam quinqueremem
et minores duas in angustiis portus cepit itemque per equites
dispositos aqua prohibere classiarios instituit.  Sed Laelius
tempore anni commodiore usus ad navigandum onerariis navibus
Corcyra Dyrrachioque aquam suis supportabat, neque a proposito
deterrebatur neque ante proelium in Thessalia factum cognitum
aut ignominia amissarum navium aut necessariarum rerum inopia ex
portu insulaque expelli potuit.


Meanwhile, D. Laelius arrived at Brundisium with the fleet and,
using the same plan as Libo had, which we have already
described, occupied the island opposite Brundisium's harbor.
Similarly, Vatinius, who was in command at Brundisium and had
readied light decked boats, lured Laelius' ships out and with
these captured one quinquereme and two smaller boats that had
put out too far from the narrow passages of the port and also
stationed his cavalry to keep the seamen from getting fresh
water.  But Laelius had made use of a more suitable time of year
for sailing and was transporting water with cargo ships from
Corcyra and Dyrrachium to his men, and he was not deterred from
his purpose, nor could he be expelled from the port and the
island, either by the dishonor of lost ships or by the lack of
necessities, before the battle in Thessaly became known.
