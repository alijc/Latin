Eodem tempore D. Laelius cum classe ad Brundisium venit eademque ratione,
qua factum a Libone antea demonstravimus,
insulam obiectam portui Brundisino tenuit.
Similiter Vatinius, qui Brundisio praeerat,
tectis instructisque scaphis elicuit
naves Laelianas atque ex his longius productam unam quinqueremem
et minores duas in angustiis portus cepit
itemque per equites dispositos aqua prohibere classiarios instituit.

Sed Laelius tempore anni commodiore usus ad navigandum
onerariis navibus Corcyra Dyrrachioque aquam suis supportabat,
neque a proposito deterrebatur neque ante proelium in Thessalia factum cognitum
aut ignominia amissarum navium aut necessariarum rerum inopia ex portu
insulaque expelli potuit.


Meanwhile, D. Laelius arrived at Brundisium with the fleet and,
using the same plan, drawn up by Libo, that we have already described
occupied the island opposite to Brundisium's harbor.
Similarly, Vatinius, who was in command at Brundisium,
hauled out Laelius' ships with covered and equipped light boats
and from these further ones
seized one quinquereme that had been bought out and two smaller boats
in the narrow passages of the port
and likewise prepared to fend off the seamen,
using his cavalry stationed by the water.
But Laelius had made use of a more suitable time of year for sailing and
was transporting water with cargo ships to Corcyra and Dyrrachium to his men,
and he was not detered by the proposition
nor could he be driven out before the battle in Thessaly became known
either by the dishonor of the lost ships or by the lack of the necessities
from the port and the island.
