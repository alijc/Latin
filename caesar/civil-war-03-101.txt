101.1
Isdem fere temporibus C. Cassius cum classe Syrorum et Phoenicum
et Cilicum in Siciliam venit,
et cum esset Caesaris classis divisa in duas partes,
dimidiae parti praeesset P. Sulpicius praetor ad Vibonem,
dimidiae M. Pomponius ad Messanam, prius Cassius ad Messanam navibus advolavit,
quam Pomponius de eius adventu cognosceret,
perturbatumque eum nactus nullis custodiis neque ordinibus certis,
magno vento et secundo completas onerarias naves taeda et pice et stuppa reliquisque rebus,
quae sunt ad incendia, in Pomponianam classem immisit atque omnes naves incendit XXXV,
e quibus erant XX constratae.
Tantusque eo facto timor incessit,
ut, cum esset legio praesidio Messanae, vix oppidum defenderetur,
et nisi eo ipso tempore quidam nuntii de Caesaris victoria
per dispositos equites essent allati,
existimabant plerique futurum fuisse, uti amitteretur.


At nearly the same time Gaius Cassius arrived at Sicily with a fleet of Syrians,
Phoenicians and Cilicians,
and after Caesar's fleet had been divided into two parts,
of which praetor P. Sulpicius commanded half at Vibone,
and M. Pomponius half at Messana.
Cassius raced to Messana by sea before Pomponius could learn of his arrival,
and finding him thrown into confusion, with neither a watch or fixed orders,
and a powerful wind blowing from the right direction,
launched cargo ships, loaded with pine torches and pitch
and tow along with other flammable matter, into Pomponius' fleet
and set all 35 ships on fire, of which 20 were decked.
And after this was done such dread advanced,
that, when the legion was to/by garrison of Messana, the town was barely defended,
and had not at the very time some messages about Caesar's victory
been brought by relays of riders,
most people thought that they were goners.
