101.1 Isdem fere temporibus C. Cassius cum classe Syrorum et
Phoenicum et Cilicum in Siciliam venit, et cum esset Caesaris
classis divisa in duas partes, dimidiae parti praeesset
P. Sulpicius praetor ad Vibonem, dimidiae M. Pomponius ad
Messanam, prius Cassius ad Messanam navibus advolavit, quam
Pomponius de eius adventu cognosceret, perturbatumque eum nactus
nullis custodiis neque ordinibus certis, magno vento et secundo
completas onerarias naves taeda et pice et stuppa reliquisque
rebus, quae sunt ad incendia, in Pomponianam classem immisit atque
omnes naves incendit XXXV, e quibus erant XX constratae.
Tantusque eo facto timor incessit, ut, cum esset legio praesidio
Messanae, vix oppidum defenderetur, et nisi eo ipso tempore quidam
nuntii de Caesaris victoria per dispositos equites essent allati,
existimabant plerique futurum fuisse, uti amitteretur.


At about the same time Gaius Cassius arrived at Sicily with a
fleet of Syrians, Phoenicians and Cilicians.  And since Caesar's
fleet had been divided into two parts, of which praetor
P. Sulpicius commanded half at Vibo, and M. Pomponius half at
Messana, Cassius raced to Messana by sea before Pomponius could
learn of his arrival, and finding him disorganized, with neither a
watch or established orders, and a powerful wind blowing from the
right direction, launched cargo ships, loaded with pitch and tar
and tow along with other flammable material, into Pomponius' fleet
and set all 35 ships, of which 20 were decked, on fire.  And after
this was done such dread fell upon them that, although Messana had
a legion to protect it, the town was barely defended, and until
the very last minute, when some messages about Caesar's victory
were brought by relays of riders, most people thought that they
were goners.
