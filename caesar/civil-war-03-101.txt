101.1 Isdem fere temporibus C. Cassius cum classe Syrorum et
Phoenicum et Cilicum in Siciliam venit, et cum esset Caesaris
classis divisa in duas partes, dimidiae parti praeesset
P. Sulpicius praetor ad Vibonem, dimidiae M. Pomponius ad
Messanam, prius Cassius ad Messanam navibus advolavit, quam
Pomponius de eius adventu cognosceret, perturbatumque eum nactus
nullis custodiis neque ordinibus certis, magno vento et secundo
completas onerarias naves taeda et pice et stuppa reliquisque
rebus, quae sunt ad incendia, in Pomponianam classem immisit atque
omnes naves incendit XXXV, e quibus erant XX constratae.
Tantusque eo facto timor incessit, ut, cum esset legio praesidio
Messanae, vix oppidum defenderetur, et nisi eo ipso tempore quidam
nuntii de Caesaris victoria per dispositos equites essent allati,
existimabant plerique futurum fuisse, uti amitteretur.


At about the same time Gaius Cassius arrived at Sicily with a
fleet of Syrians, Phoenicians and Cilicians.  And since Caesar's
fleet had been divided into two parts, of which praetor
P. Sulpicius commanded half at Vibo, and M. Pomponius half at
Messana, Cassius raced to Messana by sea before Pomponius could
learn of his arrival, and finding him disorganized, with neither a
watch or established orders, and a powerful wind blowing from the
right direction, launched cargo ships, loaded with pitch and tar
and tow along with other flammable material, into Pomponius' fleet
and set all 35 ships, of which 20 were decked, on fire.  And after
this was done such dread fell upon them that, although Messana had
a legion to protect it, the town was barely defended, and until
the very last minute, when some messages about Caesar's victory
were brought by relays of riders, most people thought that they
were goners.


101.1 Sed opportunissime nuntiis allatis oppidum est defensum;
Cassiusque ad Sulpicianam inde classem profectus est Vibonem,
applicatisque nostris ad terram navibus pari atque antea ratione
Cassius secundum nactus ventum onerarias naves praeparatas ad incendium immisit,
et flamma ab utroque cornu comprensa naves sunt combustae quinque.
Cumque ignis magnitudine venti latius serperet, milites,
qui ex veteribus legionibus erant relicti praesidio navibus ex numero aegrorum,
ignominiam non tulerunt, sed sua sponte naves conscenderunt et a terra
solverunt impetuque facto in Cassianam classem quinqueremes duas,
in quarum altera erat Cassius, ceperunt;
sed Cassius exceptus scapha refugit; praeterea duae sunt depressae triremes.
Neque multo post de proelio facto in Thessalia cognitum est,
ut ipsis Pompeianis fides fieret;
nam ante id tempus fingi a legatis amicisque Caesaris arbitrabantur.
Quibus rebus cognitis ex his locis Cassius cum classe discessit.


But fortunately, after the messages came in the town WAS defended;
and Cassius took the fleet from there to Vibo at Sulpicia,
but as we had already made landfall with an equal number of ships,
when Cassius got a favorable wind he sent in cargo ships set up as
incendiaries, five ships caught fire from both sides and were burnt up.
And when the fire grew more extensive, from the magnitude of the wind, soldiers,
from veteran legions left as a guard for the ships and from the number of the ill,
couldn't bear the disgrace, but of their own will boarded ships
and set sail and, launching an attack against Cassius' fleet, seized
two quinqueremes, including the one where Cassius was
(only Cassius managed to escape in a skiff).
In addition, two triemes were sunk.
And not much later
Pompey's men learned of the battle that had been fought in Thessaly,
so that even they came to believe it - 
for before this time they assumed that 
it was only imagined by Caesar's envoys and friends.
And after he having learned these things from these places,
Cassius departed, with the fleet.
