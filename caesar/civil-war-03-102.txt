102.1
Caesar omnibus rebus relictis persequendum sibi Pompeium existimavit,
quascumque in partes se ex fuga recepisset,
ne rursus copias comparare alias et bellum renovare posset,
et quantumcumque itineris equitatu efficere poterat,
cotidie progrediebatur legionemque unam minoribus itineribus subsequi iussit.
Erat edictum Pompei nomine Amphipoli propositum,
uti omnes eius provinciae iuniores, Graeci civesque Romani,
iurandi causa convenirent.
Sed utrum avertendae suspicionis causa Pompeius proposuisset,
ut quam diutissime longioris fugae consilium occultaret,
an ut novis dilectibus, si nemo premeret,
Macedoniam tenere conaretur, existimari non poterat.
Ipse ad ancoram unam noctem constitit et vocatis ad se Amphipoli hospitibus
et pecunia ad necessarios sumptus corrogata,
cognito Caesaris adventu,
ex eo loco discessit et Mytilenas paucis diebus venit.
Biduum tempestate retentus navibusque aliis additis actuariis in Ciliciam
atque inde Cyprum pervenit.
Ibi cognoscit consensu omnium Antiochensium civiumque Romanorum,
qui illic negotiarentur,
arma capta esse excludendi sui causa nuntiosque dimissos ad eos,
qui se ex fuga in finitimas civitates recepisse dicerentur,
ne Antiochiam adirent:
id si fecissent, magno eorum capitis periculo futurum.
Idem hoc L. Lentulo, qui superiore anno consul fuerat,
et P. Lentulo consulari ac nonnullis aliis acciderat Rhodi;
qui cum ex fuga Pompeium sequerentur atque in insulam venissent,
oppido ac portu recepti non erant missisque ad eos nuntiis,
ut ex his locis discederent contra voluntatem suam naves solverant.
Iamque de Caesaris adventu fama ad civitates perferebatur.


Caesar assumed that Pompey would pursue every opportunity that remained to him
in whichever regions he might take himself in his flight,
and to keep him from collecting other forces and renewing the war again,
he advanced each day by however much his cavalry was able,
and ordered one legion to follow them at a slower pace.
A resolution had been proclaimed at Amphipolus, in Pompey's name,
that all draft-age men of his province, whether Greek or Roman citizens,
should assemble to swear an oath of allegiance.
But he couldn't judge
whether Pompey proposed this to divert suspicion
and conceal his flight for as long as possible,
or to  attempt to occupy Macedonia with fresh levies, if no one pursued him.
Pomper himself stood at anchor one night and,
after summoning the hosts of Amphipolus and collecting money for needed
expenses, he learned of Caesar's arrival and withdrew from there
and went to Mytilenae for a few days.
After being held up for two days by a storm and with other faster ships added to
his fleet, he reached Cilicia and Cyprus.
There he learned that, by the general consent of all Antiochian and Roman
citizens who did business there, 
captured arms were of his exclusion cause and that messengers sent off to
those, who had been said to have taken flight to nearby cities,
for fear that they would attack Antioch;
had they had done it, they'd be in great peril of their heads.
The same thing had happened at Rhodes to L. Lentulus,
who had been consul the previous year.
and to P. Lentulus to/by consular and several others;
who when they followed Pompey from flight and reached the island,
had not been taken in by the town and harbor after sending messengers to
them, so that they withdrew from these places against their will and set sail.
And already the rumor of Caesar's arrival was being carried to the cities.
