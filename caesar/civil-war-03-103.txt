103.1 Quibus cognitis rebus Pompeius deposito adeundae Syriae consilio
pecunia societatis sublata et a quibusdam privatis sumpta et aeris magno
pondere ad militarem usum in naves imposito duobusque milibus hominum
armatis, partim quos ex familiis societatum delegerat, partim a
negotiatoribus coegerat, quosque ex suis quisque ad hanc rem idoneos
existimabat, Pelusium pervenit.
Ibi casu rex erat Ptolomaeus, puer aetate,
magnis copiis cum sorore Cleopatra bellum gerens,
quam paucis ante mensibus per suos propinquos atque amicos regno expulerat;
castraque Cleopatrae non longo spatio ab eius castris distabant.
Ad eum Pompeius misit, ut pro hospitio atque amicitia patris Alexandria
reciperetur atque illius opibus in calamitate tegeretur.
Sed qui ab eo missi erant,
confecto legationis officio liberius cum militibus regis
colloqui coeperunt eosque hortari, ut suum officium Pompeio praestarent,
neve eius fortunam despicerent.

In hoc erant numero complures Pompei milites,
quos ex eius exercitu acceptos in Syria Gabinius Alexandriam
traduxerat belloque confecto apud Ptolomaeum, patrem pueri, reliquerat.


After learning of these things, Pompey gave up on the plan for attacking Syria.
Money that had been raised from his allies had been taken up by certain private
citizens, and a great weight of coinage had been loaded onto ships,
along with two thousand armed men.
Some of these he had chosen from the households of his allies,
and some he had rounded up from traders,
he judged that each of them would be suitable for the matter at hand.
And after all this, he made it to Pelusium.
By chance the king there was Ptolomy, a boy in age,
waging war with powerful forces on his sister Cleopatra,
whom he had driven out of the kingdom a few months before
by means of their relatives and friends.
Pompey sent to him, asking that,
for the sake of the hospitality and friendship of his father,
he be received in Alexandria and protected, in his misfortune,
by Ptolomy's power.
But those whom he had sent,
after having dispatched the office of the embassy,
began to speak more freely with the king's soldiers and to exhort them
to surpass their kindness to Pompey, and not to scorn his misfortune.
Among this number there were many of Pompey's soldiers,
who, having been accepted from his army in Syria,
Gabinius had transferred to Alexandria,
and then left with Ptolomy, the boy's father, after the war was over.
