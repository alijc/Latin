103.1 Quibus cognitis rebus Pompeius deposito adeundae Syriae
consilio pecunia societatis sublata et a quibusdam privatis sumpta
et aeris magno pondere ad militarem usum in naves imposito duobusque
milibus hominum armatis, partim quos ex familiis societatum
delegerat, partim a negotiatoribus coegerat, quosque ex suis quisque
ad hanc rem idoneos existimabat, Pelusium pervenit.  Ibi casu rex
erat Ptolomaeus, puer aetate, magnis copiis cum sorore Cleopatra
bellum gerens, quam paucis ante mensibus per suos propinquos atque
amicos regno expulerat; castraque Cleopatrae non longo spatio ab
eius castris distabant.  Ad eum Pompeius misit, ut pro hospitio
atque amicitia patris Alexandria reciperetur atque illius opibus in
calamitate tegeretur.  Sed qui ab eo missi erant, confecto
legationis officio liberius cum militibus regis colloqui coeperunt
eosque hortari, ut suum officium Pompeio praestarent, neve eius
fortunam despicerent.  In hoc erant numero complures Pompei milites,
quos ex eius exercitu acceptos in Syria Gabinius Alexandriam
traduxerat belloque confecto apud Ptolomaeum, patrem pueri,
reliquerat.


After learning of these events, Pompey gave up on his plan for
attacking Syria.  He carried off the taxes that had been collected
and obtained money from certain private citizens, and loaded a
great weight of coinage onto ships for military use, along with two
thousand armed men.  Some of these he had chosen from the
households of the tax farmers, and some he had rounded up from
traders, as well as those of his own that he thought would be
suitable for the matter at hand.  And after all this, he made it to
Pelusium.  By chance the king there, Ptolemy, a boy in age, was
waging war with a powerful army against his sister Cleopatra, whom
he had driven out of the kingdom a few months before by means of
his relatives and friends; and Cleopatra's camp was not far from
his own.  Pompey sent to him, asking that, for the sake of the
hospitality and friendship of his father, he be received in
Alexandria and protected, in his misfortune, under Ptolomy's power.
Now those whom he had sent, after having dispatched the office of
embassy, began to speak rather freely with the king's soldiers and
to exhort them to fulfill their duty to Pompey, and not to scorn
his misfortune.  Among this number there were many of Pompey's
soldiers, whom Gabinius had taken from his army in Syria and
transferred to Alexandria, and then left them with Ptolemy, the
boy's father, after the war was over.
