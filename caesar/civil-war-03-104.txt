04.1 His tum cognitis rebus amici regis, qui propter aetatem eius in
procuratione erant regni, sive timore adducti, ut postea praedicabant,
sollicitato exercitu regio ne Pompeius Alexandriam Aegyptumque
occuparet, sive despecta eius fortuna, ut plerumque in calamitate ex
amicis inimici exsistunt, his, qui erant ab eo missi, palam liberaliter
responderunt eumque ad regem venire iusserunt; ipsi clam consilio inito
Achillam, praefectum regium, singulari hominem audacia, et L. Septimium,
tribunum militum, ad interficiendum Pompeium miserunt.  Ab his
liberaliter ipse appellatus et quadam notitia Septimii productus, quod
bello praedonum apud eum ordinem duxerat, naviculam parvulam conscendit
cum paucis suis: ibi ab Achilla et Septimio interficitur.  Item
L. Lentulus comprehenditur ab rege et in custodia necatur.

Then, after the king's friends, regents of the kingdom in the king's
minority, learned of these things, either persuaded by the fear, as they
afterwards declared, that Pompey would incite the royal army and seize
Alexandria and Egypt, or despising his misfortune, as tends to happen in
a disaster, when enemies emerge out of friends, they publicly gave a
courteous answer to the men whom he had sent, and gave orders for him to
come to the king.  They themselves, after a secret deliberation, sent
Achillas, the royal prefect, a man of singular audacity, and
L. Septimius, a military tribune, to kill Pompey.  When he himself was
courteously addressed by these men and was won over by a slight
acquaintance with Septimius, he boarded a skiff with a few of his men:
and there was killed by Achillas and Septimius.  Likewise L. Lentulus
was seized by the king and was put to death in custody.
