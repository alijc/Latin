105.1 Caesar, cum in Asiam venisset, reperiebat T. Ampium conatum esse
pecunias tollere Epheso ex fano Dianae eiusque rei causa senatores omnes
ex provincia evocasse, ut his testibus in summa pecuniae uteretur, sed
interpellatum adventu Caesaris profugisse. Ita duobus temporibus
Ephesiae pecuniae Caesar auxilium tulit. Item constabat Elide in templo
Minervae repetitis atque enumeratis diebus, quo die proelium secundum
Caesar fecisset, simulacrum Victoriae, quod ante ipsam Minervam
collocatum esset et ante ad simulacrum Minervae spectavisset, ad valvas
se templi limenque convertisse. Eodemque die Antiochiae in Syria bis
tantus exercitus clamor et signorum sonus exauditus est, ut in muris
armata civitas discurreret. Hoc idem Ptolomaide accidit. Pergami in
occultis ac reconditis templi, quo praeter sacerdotes adire fas non est,
quae Graeci adyta appellant, tympana sonuerunt. Item Trallibus in templo
Victoriae, ubi Caesaris statuam consecraverant, palma per eos dies inter
coagmenta lapidum ex pavimento exstitisse ostendebatur.

After Caesar reached Asia he learned that T. Ampius had undertaken to take money
from the shrine of Diana in Ephesus and had summoned all the senators from the
province to bear witness to the amount of money, but had run off when
interrupted by Caesar's arrival.  Thus Caesar brought aid to the Ephesian money
twice.  Likewise, when they counted up the days, it was noted that on the day
that Caesar had fought the second battle, an image of Victory in the temple of
Minerva in Elis, which had been erected in front of the image of Minerva and
faced that image, had turned around to face the doors and threshold of the
temple.  And on the same day in Antioch in Syria such a clamor of an army and
noise of battle was heard clearly, twice, so that within the walls the citizenry
ran about under arms.  The same thing happened at Ptolomais.  In the secret and
hidden places of the temple of Pergamus, which the Greeks call the adyta, where
no one besides the priests was allowed to be, cymbals were heard.  Likewise in
those days in the temple of Victory at Trallis, where they had dedicated a
statue to Caesar, a palm tree appeared between joints of the stone in the
pavement.
