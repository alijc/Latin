106.1 Caesar paucos dies in Asia moratus, cum audisset Pompeium
Cypri visum, coniectans eum in Aegyptum iter habere propter
necessitudines regni reliquasque eius loci opportunitates cum
legione una, quam se ex Thessalia sequi iusserat, et altera, quam
ex Achaia a Q. Fufio legato evocaverat, equitibusque DCCC et
navibus longis Rhodiis X et Asiaticis paucis Alexandriam
pervenit.  In his erant legionibus hominum milia tria CC; reliqui
vulneribus ex proeliis et labore ac magnitudine itineris confecti
consequi non potuerant.  Sed Caesar confisus fama rerum gestarum
infirmis auxiliis proficisci non dubitaverat, aeque omnem sibi
locum tutum fore existimans.  Alexandriae de Pompei morte
cognoscit atque ibi primum e nave egrediens clamorem militum
audit, quos rex in oppido praesidii causa reliquerat, et
concursum ad se fieri videt, quod fasces anteferrentur.  In hoc
omnis multitudo maiestatem regiam minui praedicabat.  Hoc sedato
tumultu crebrae continuis diebus ex concursu multitudinis
concitationes fiebant, compluresque milites in viis urbis omnibus
partibus interficiebantur.

Caesar had been delayed in Asia for a few days when he heard that
Pompey had been sighted in Cyprus.  Concluding that he was on his
way to Egypt, because of his connections with the kingdom and the
other opportunities of that place, he made for Alexandria with
one legion that he'd ordered to follow him from Thessaly and
another that he'd summoned from Achaia from the legate Q. Fufius,
and 800 horse and 10 galleys from Rhodes and a few from Asia.
There were 3200 men in these legions; the rest were not able to
follow, exhausted by their battle injuries and labor and the
intensity of the march.  But Caesar, relying on the fame of what
had been done, had not hestiated to set out with weak
auxiliaries, thinking that every place was going to be equally
safe for him.  In Alexandria he learned of Pompey's death and
upon first disembarking from the ship heard the shouts of the
soldiers that the king had left garrisoned in the town, and saw a
tumult gathering around him, because the fasces were carried
before him.  In this the whole crowd proclaimed that the royal
majesty was reduced.  After this commotion had died down, for
days running repeated disturbances arose from the encounter of
the crowd, and many soldiers were killed in the streets in all
parts of the city.
