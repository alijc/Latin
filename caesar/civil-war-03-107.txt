Quibus rebus animadversis legiones sibi alias ex Asia adduci iussit,
quas ex Pompeianis militibus confecerat.
Ipse enim necessario etesiis tenebatur,

ostendit sibi placere regem Ptolomaeum atque eius sororem Cleopatram exercitus,
quos haberent,
dimittere et de controversiis iure apud se potius quam inter se armis disceptare.

that he might be consul,
thinking that it extended and that it was more fit for his office/service,
because an alliance had been made in his last consulship with Ptolomy Sr
and by law and decree of the Senate,

he showed to self to please King Ptolomy and his sister Cleopatra >the armies,
that they might have,
to send away and from dispute by right at self better than among selves to/by
arms to arbitrate they arbitrated.
