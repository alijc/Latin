108.1
Erat in procuratione regni propter aetatem pueri nutricius eius,
eunuchus nomine Pothinus.
Is primum inter suos queri atque indignari coepit regem ad causam dicendam evocari;
deinde adiutores quosdam consilii sui nactus ex regis amicis exercitum a Pelusio
clam Alexandriam evocavit atque eundem Achillam,
cuius supra meminimus, omnibus copiis praefecit.
Hunc incitatum suis et regis inflatum pollicitationibus,
quae fieri vellet, litteris nuntiisque edocuit.
In testamento Ptolomaei patris heredes erant scripti ex duobus filiis maior et
ex duabus filiabus ea, quae aetate antecedebat.
Haec uti fierent, per omnes deos perque foedera, quae Romae fecisset,
eodem testamento Ptolomaeus populum Romanum obtestabatur.
Tabulae testamenti unae per legatos eius Romam erant allatae,
ut in aerario ponerentur (hic cum propter publicas occupationes
poni non potuissent, apud Pompeium sunt depositae),
alterae eodem exemplo relictae atque obsignatae Alexandriae proferebantur.

Due to the boy's age, he had a foster-father(regent?)
in the royal administration, a eunuch by the name of Pothinus.
He started out by complaining and waxing indignant among his own people
that the king was being summoned to plead his case;
then, after obtaining some supporters for his plan from the king's friends,
he secretly called the army from Pelusium to Alexandria
and placed in command the same Achillas, whom we mentioned above,
in charge of all the troops.
Using messengers carrying letters, he informed this man,
who had been urged on by his own men and puffed up with the king's promises,
what he wanted to be done.
In the will of Ptolomy Sr the heirs had been written out of two sons the elder
and of two daughters the one who was preceding in age...
And to make sure that this happened,
by all the gods and by a treaty that he made to/of Rome,
in the same will Ptolomy called the Roman people to witness.
One copy of the will had been brought to Rome by his legates,
to be placed in the treasury 
(since they hadn't been able to place them here,
on account of public occupations, they were entrusted to Pompey)
the second identical copy, sealed and left in Alexandria,
they brought forward/discovered.
