109.1 De his rebus cum ageretur apud Caesarem, isque maxime vellet pro
communi amico atque arbitro controversias regum componere, subito
exercitus regius equitatusque omnis venire Alexandriam nuntiatur.
Caesaris copiae nequaquam erant tantae, ut eis, extra oppidum si esset
dimicandum, confideret.  Relinquebatur, ut se suis locis oppido
teneret consiliumque Achillae cognosceret.  Milites tamen omnes in
armis esse iussit regemque hortatus est, ut ex suis necessariis, quos
haberet maximae auctoritatis, legatos ad Achillam mitteret et, quid
esset suae voluntatis, ostenderet.  A quo missi Dioscorides et
Serapion, qui ambo legati Romae fuerant magnamque apud patrem
Ptolomaeum auctoritatem habuerant, ad Achillam pervenerunt.  Quos
ille, cum in conspectum eius venissent, priusquam audiret aut, cuius
rei causa missi essent, cognosceret, corripi atque interfici iussit;
quorum alter accepto vulnere occupatus per suos pro occiso sublatus,
alter interfectus est.  Quo facto regem ut in sua potestate haberet,
Caesar efficit, magnam regium nomen apud suos auctoritatem habere
existimans et ut potius privato paucorum et latronum quam regio
consilio susceptum bellum videretur.


While Caesar was holding a meeting on these matters, and was advocating
for a common ally and judge to settle the monarchs' disputes, it was
announced that the entire royal infantry and cavalry had unexpectedly
arrived in Alexandria.  Caesar's troops by no means were numerous
enough for him to rely on them if there was to be fighting outside the
town, so he remained in place, to hold his positions in the town and
and to learn of Achillas' purpose.  Still, he ordered all his soldiers
to arms and urged the king to send envoys to Achillas from his
relatives, whoever he had with greatest authority, and to make it
clear what his will was.  The ones he sent, Dioscorides and Serapion,
had both been ambassadors to Rome and had had great power in Ptolomy
Sr's reign.  But when they got to Achillas, as soon as they came into
view, before he could hear them out or learn why they'd been sent, he
ordered them to be seized and killed.  One of them was wounded and,
taken for dead, carried off by his own men, while the other was killed
outright.  And after this happened, Caesar effected to keep the king
under his control, thinking that the great royal name held authority
before his subjects, and that it would seem better for a war to have
been started by a few bandits than by the royal council.
