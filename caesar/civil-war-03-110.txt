110.1 Erant cum Achilla eae copiae,
ut neque numero neque genere hominum neque usu rei militaris contemnendae viderentur.
Milia enim XX in armis habebat.
Haec constabant ex Gabinianis militibus qui iam in consuetudinem Alexandrinae
vitae ac licentiae venerant et nomen disciplinamque
populi Romani dedidicerant uxoresque duxerant,
ex quibus plerique liberos habebant.
Huc accedebant collecti ex praedonibus latronibusque Syriae Ciliciaeque provinciae finitimarumque regionum.
Multi praeterea capitis damnati exulesque convenerant;
fugitivis omnibus nostris certus erat Alexandriae receptus certaque vitae condicio,
ut dato nomine militum essent numero;
quorum si quis a domino prehenderetur, consensu militum eripiebatur,
qui vim suorum, quod in simili culpa versabantur,
ipsi pro suo periculo defendebant.
Hi regum amicos ad mortem deposcere, hi bona locupletum diripere,
stipendii augendi causa regis domum obsidere, regno expellere alios,
alios arcessere vetere quodam Alexandrini exercitus instituto consuerant.
Erant praeterea equitum milia duo.
Inveteraverant hi omnes compluribus Alexandriae bellis;
Ptolomaeum patrem in regnum reduxerant,
Bibuli filios duos interfecerant,
bella cum Aegyptiis gesserant.
Hunc usum rei militaris habebant.


Achillas had troops that seemed to be considerable in number, class of men
and skill in military matters.
For he had 20,000 under arms.
These troops were made up from Gabinus' soldiers,
who by now had entered into the habit of life and disorderliness in Alexandria.
They'd forgotten the title and discipline of Roman people
and had taken wives, with whom most had children.
Assembled from thieves and brigands of the
provinces of Syria and Cilicia and from the neighboring regions,
they were drawing near.
Besides these, many condemned criminals and exiles had assembled;
with all our refugees he was sure in/to Alexandria retreat fixed term of life,
when to/by given name of soldiers they might be in number;
of whom if anyone from master might be caught, by agreement of soldiers he was
rescued,
who >forse of their own men, that/because in like crime they lived,
they themselves for their own danger were defending.
These of king >friends to death to demand,
these good things to tear to pieces,
for the sake of increasing pay of the king >house to besiege,
to/by king to drive out >some,
>some to send for to/by a certain veteran Alexandrian the institution of the
army they had been accustomed.
Besides, there were two thousand of calvary.
These all had grown established to/by a good many wars in Alexandria;
Ptolomay Sr into kingdom they had restored,
they'd killed the two sons of Bibulus,
they'd waged wars with Egypt.
They held this use of military affairs.
