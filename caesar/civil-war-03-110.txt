110.1 Erant cum Achilla eae copiae, ut neque numero neque genere
hominum neque usu rei militaris contemnendae viderentur.  Milia
enim XX in armis habebat.  Haec constabant ex Gabinianis
militibus qui iam in consuetudinem Alexandrinae vitae ac
licentiae venerant et nomen disciplinamque populi Romani
dedidicerant uxoresque duxerant, ex quibus plerique liberos
habebant.  Huc accedebant collecti ex praedonibus latronibusque
Syriae Ciliciaeque provinciae finitimarumque regionum.  Multi
praeterea capitis damnati exulesque convenerant; fugitivis
omnibus nostris certus erat Alexandriae receptus certaque vitae
condicio, ut dato nomine militum essent numero; quorum si quis a
domino prehenderetur, consensu militum eripiebatur, qui vim
suorum, quod in simili culpa versabantur, ipsi pro suo periculo
defendebant.  Hi regum amicos ad mortem deposcere, hi bona
locupletum diripere, stipendii augendi causa regis domum
obsidere, regno expellere alios, alios arcessere vetere quodam
Alexandrini exercitus instituto consuerant.  Erant praeterea
equitum milia duo.  Inveteraverant hi omnes compluribus
Alexandriae bellis; Ptolomaeum patrem in regnum reduxerant,
Bibuli filios duos interfecerant, bella cum Aegyptiis gesserant.
Hunc usum rei militaris habebant.


Achillas' troops were not to be despised, either in number,
character of men or skill in military matters, for he had 20,000
under arms.  These troops were made up from Gabinus' soldiers,
who by this time had fallen into Alexandria's disorderly way of
life.  They'd forgotten the title and discipline of Roman people
and had taken wives, with whom most had children.  Assembled from
thieves and brigands of the provinces of Syria and Cilicia and
from the neighboring regions, they were drawing near.  Besides
these, many criminals condemned to death and exiles had
assembled.  For all the fugitive slaves with us a sure withdrawl
to Alexandria was a sure condition for life, when they could be
counted among the number of soldiers.  And if any of them was
captured by his master, he'd be rescued by the common accord of
the soldiers, who would themselves repel them with their own
forces, in view of their own danger, since they were involved in
the same crime.  These men had gotten into the habit of calling
for the death of the royal ministers, trashing the property of
the wealthy.  occupying the royal palace to demand higher pay,
driving some men out of the kingdom and inviting others in,
according to some old, longstanding plan of the Alexandrian army.
Besides these, there were two thousand calvary men.  These had
all become established through a good many wars in Alexandria;
They had restored Ptolomay Sr to the kingdom, killed the two sons
of Bibulus, and waged wars with Egypt.  They held this use of
military affairs.
