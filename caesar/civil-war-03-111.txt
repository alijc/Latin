111.1 His copiis fidens Achillas paucitatemque militum Caesaris
despiciens occupabat Alexandriam praeter eam oppidi partem, quam
Caesar cum militibus tenebat, primo impetu domum eius irrumpere
conatus; sed Caesar dispositis per vias cohortibus impetum eius
sustinuit.  Eodemque tempore pugnatum est ad portum, ac longe
maximam ea res attulit dimicationem.  Simul enim diductis copiis
pluribus viis pugnabatur, et magna multitudine naves longas
occupare hostes conabantur; quarum erant L auxilio missae ad
Pompeium proelioque in Thessalia facto domum redierant,
quadriremes omnes et quinqueremes aptae instructaeque omnibus
rebus ad navigandum, praeter has XXII, quae praesidii causa
Alexandriae esse consuerant, constratae omnes; quas si
occupavissent, classe Caesari erepta portum ac mare totum in sua
potestate haberent, commeatu auxiliisque Caesarem prohiberent.
Itaque tanta est contentione actum, quanta agi debuit, cum illi
celerem in ea re victoriam, hi salutem suam consistere viderent.
Sed rem obtinuit Caesar omnesque eas naves et reliquas, quae
erant in navalibus, incendit, quod tam late tueri parva manu non
poterat, confestimque ad Pharum navibus milites exposuit.

Achillas, confident in these troops and contempuous of the
paucity of Caesar's soldiers, seized Alexandria, except for the
part of town which Caesar held with his soldiers, and attempted
in an initial attack to break into the palace; but Caesar, with
his cohorts stationed in the surrounding streets, sustained the
attack.  At the same time a battle raged at the harbor, and this
matter brought on the greatest fight by far.  For it too was
fought with dispersed forces on a great many streets, and the
enemy tried, using a huge mob, to capture the galleys.  Fifty of
these had been sent to support Pompey and had returned home after
doing battle in Thessaly, all of them quadriremes and
quadriremes, rigged with everything needed for sailing.  Besides
these were 22 that had been used for the defense of Alexandria,
all of them decked.  Had they captured these they would have,
with Caesar's fleet taken by force, held the harbor and the whole
sea within their power, and could have kept supplies and
auxiliaries from Caesar.  And so, regardless of how hard the
doing was, it had to be done, when one side saw a swift victory
in the affair, and the other that their safety lay in making a stand.
But Caesar won the day and fired all these ships and others, that
were docked, because he could not protect an extended area with a
small band, and immediately disembarked soldiers from the ships at
Pharos.
