111.1
His copiis fidens Achillas paucitatemque militum Caesaris despiciens occupabat
Alexandriam praeter eam oppidi partem,
quam Caesar cum militibus tenebat,
primo impetu domum eius irrumpere conatus;
sed Caesar dispositis per vias cohortibus impetum eius sustinuit.
Eodemque tempore pugnatum est ad portum,
ac longe maximam ea res attulit dimicationem.
Simul enim diductis copiis pluribus viis pugnabatur,
et magna multitudine naves longas occupare hostes conabantur;
quarum erant L auxilio missae ad Pompeium proelioque in Thessalia facto domum redierant,
quadriremes omnes et quinqueremes aptae instructaeque omnibus rebus ad navigandum,
praeter has XXII, quae praesidii causa Alexandriae esse consuerant,
constratae omnes;
quas si occupavissent,
classe Caesari erepta portum ac mare totum in sua potestate haberent,
commeatu auxiliisque Caesarem prohiberent.
Itaque tanta est contentione actum,
quanta agi debuit, cum illi celerem in ea re victoriam,
hi salutem suam consistere viderent.
Sed rem obtinuit Caesar omnesque eas naves et reliquas,
quae erant in navalibus, incendit,
quod tam late tueri parva manu non poterat,
confestimque ad Pharum navibus milites exposuit.

Achillas, confident in these troops and contempuous of the paucity of Caesar's
soldiers, seized Alexandria,
except for the part of town which Caesar held with his soldiers,
and attempted in his initial attack to break into his house;
but Caesar, with his cohorts stationed throughout the streets, sustained the
attack.
At the same time a battle raged at the harbor,
and this matter brought the greatest fight by far.
For it was also fought with dispersed forces on most streets,
and the enemy tried, using a huge mob, to capture the galleys;
of which there were 50 in support sent to Pompey and to battle built in Thessaly
>house they had returned,
all quadriremes and quadriremes  suitable and equipped with all things for
sailing, besides these 22, which for the sake of protectiong Alexandria they
were used to be, all decked;
but had captured these, with Caesar's fleet taken by force,
they would have held the harbor and the whole sea whole in their power,
and would have forbidden Caesar his supplies and auxiliaries.
And so by however great a contention it was done,
by that much to do he had to, when to him >swift victory in the matter,
they might see their safety to make a stand.
But Caesar obtained the thing and fired all the ships and the rest, that were at dock,
because he could not protect so much far and wide with a small band,
and immediately disembarked soldiers from ships at Pharos.
