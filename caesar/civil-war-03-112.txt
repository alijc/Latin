112.1 Pharus est in insula turris magna altitudine, mirificis
operibus exstructae; quae nomen ab insula accepit.  Haec insula
obiecta Alexandriae portum efficit; sed a superioribus regibus in
longitudinem passuum a DCCC in mare iactis molibus angusto
itinere ut ponte cum oppido coniungitur.  In hac sunt insula
domicilia Aegyptiorum et vicus oppidi magnitudine; quaeque ibi
naves imprudentia aut tempestate paulum suo cursu decesserunt,
has more praedonum diripere consuerunt.  Eis autem invitis, a
quibus Pharus tenetur, non potest esse propter angustias navibus
introitus in portum.  Hoc tum veritus Caesar, hostibus in pugna
occupatis, militibus expositis Pharum prehendit atque ibi
praesidium posuit.  Quibus est rebus effectum, uti tuto frumentum
auxiliaque navibus ad eum supportari possent.  Dimisit enim
circum omnes propinquas provincias atque inde auxilia evocavit.
Reliquis oppidi partibus sic est pugnatum, ut aequo proelio
discederetur et neutri pellerentur (id efficiebant angustiae
loci), paucisque utrimque interfectis Caesar loca maxime
necessaria complexus noctu praemuniit.  In eo tractu oppidi pars
erat regiae exigua, in quam ipse habitandi causa initio erat
inductus, et theatrum coniunctum domui quod arcis tenebat locum
aditusque habebat ad portum et ad reliqua navalia.  Has
munitiones insequentibus auxit diebus, ut pro muro obiectas
haberet neu dimicare invitus cogeretur.  Interim filia minor
Ptolomaei regis vacuam possessionem regni sperans ad Achillam
sese ex regia traiecit unaque bellum administrare coepit.  Sed
celeriter est inter eos de principatu controversia orta; quae res
apud milites largitiones auxit; magnis enim iacturis sibi quisque
eorum animos conciliabat.  Haec dum apud hostes geruntur,
Pothinus, nutricius pueri et procurator regni in parte Caesaris,
cum ad Achillam nuntios mitteret hortareturque, ne negotio
desisteret neve animo deficeret, indicatis deprehensisque
internuntiis a Caesare est interfectus.  Haec initia belli
Alexandrini fuerunt.

The Pharos is on an island, a tower of great height, built up
with amazing works; which has taken its name from the island.
This island is across from Alexandria and creates its harbor; but
as more recent kings constructed jetties across a narrow passage
in the sea - a distance 0.8 miles - it is connected with the town
by a bridge.  On this island are houses for the Egyptians and a
village the size of a town; any ships that strayed there by
mistake or a storm, these they were accustomed to plunder in the
custom of pirates.  But if those who hold Pharos are unwilling,
one cannot enter, on account of the narrow entrance for ships
into the harbor.  Caesar was afraid of this, so while his
enemies were engaged in battle, he landed soldiers on Pharos and
captured it and posted a garrison there.  And by this it was
brought about that grain and reinforcements could be safely
shipped to him.  For he sent off to all nearby provinces and
summoned reinforcements from them.  In the rest of town the
battle raged equally, so that neither side retreated or was
beaten (the confined passages of the place caused this) and with
few men killed Caesar fortified the surrounding positions
chiefly, of necessity, by night.  In that tract of town was a
small part of the palace, that had been established as Caesar's
residence, and he held a theater that adjoined the house as a
stronghold, and which also had an approach to the harbor and to
the rest of the docks.  He added to these fortifications in the
subsequent days, so that he could use them in the place of a wall
and not be forced to fight against his will.  In the meantime,
the younger daughter of King Ptolomy, hoping to seize a vacant
throne, hurled herself from the palace to Achillas and started to
assist in the war.  But a dispute quickly rose between them about
the leadership; which increased the largess among the soldiers;
for only by great cost to oneself could the heart of any of them
be won over.  While these things were going on among the enemy,
Pothinus, the boy's regent and the king's deputy for Caesar's
side, sent messengers to Achillas, urging him to keep on with the
business and not to lose heart.  But when his goings-on were
discovered he was killed by Caesar.  These events were the
beginnings of the Alexandrian war.
