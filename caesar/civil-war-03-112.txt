112.1
Pharus est in insula turris magna altitudine,
mirificis operibus exstructae; quae nomen ab insula accepit.
Haec insula obiecta Alexandriae portum efficit;
sed a superioribus regibus in longitudinem passuum a DCCC in mare
iactis molibus angusto itinere ut ponte cum oppido coniungitur.
In hac sunt insula domicilia Aegyptiorum et vicus oppidi magnitudine;
quaeque ibi naves imprudentia aut tempestate paulum suo cursu decesserunt,
has more praedonum diripere consuerunt.
Eis autem invitis, a quibus Pharus tenetur,
non potest esse propter angustias navibus introitus in portum.
Hoc tum veritus Caesar, hostibus in pugna occupatis,
militibus expositis Pharum prehendit atque ibi praesidium posuit.
Quibus est rebus effectum,
uti tuto frumentum auxiliaque navibus ad eum supportari possent.
Dimisit enim circum omnes propinquas provincias atque inde auxilia evocavit.
Reliquis oppidi partibus sic est pugnatum,
ut aequo proelio discederetur et neutri pellerentur
(id efficiebant angustiae loci),
paucisque utrimque interfectis Caesar loca maxime necessaria complexus noctu praemuniit.
In eo tractu oppidi pars erat regiae exigua,
in quam ipse habitandi causa initio erat inductus,
et theatrum coniunctum domui quod arcis tenebat locum aditusque habebat
ad portum et ad reliqua navalia.
Has munitiones insequentibus auxit diebus,
ut pro muro obiectas haberet neu dimicare invitus cogeretur.
Interim filia minor Ptolomaei regis vacuam possessionem regni sperans ad
Achillam sese ex regia traiecit unaque bellum administrare coepit.
Sed celeriter est inter eos de principatu controversia orta;
quae res apud milites largitiones auxit;
magnis enim iacturis sibi quisque eorum animos conciliabat.

Haec dum apud hostes geruntur, Pothinus, nutricius
pueri et procurator regni in parte Caesaris, cum ad Achillam nuntios
mitteret hortareturque, ne negotio desisteret neve animo deficeret,
indicatis deprehensisque internuntiis a Caesare est interfectus. Haec
initia belli Alexandrini fuerunt.

Pharos is on a towering island,
built up with amazing works; which has taken its name from the island.
This island was built opposite Alexandria's harbor;
but as more recent kings built up jetties across a narrow passage in the sea
- a distance 0.8 miles -
it is connected with the town by a bridge.
On this island are houses for the Egyptians and a village the size of a town;
any ships that strayed there by ignorance or a storm a little off course,
these they were accustomed to plunder in the custom of pirates.
But for the reluctant unwilling men who hold Pharos,
it cannot be on account of the narrow entrance for ships into the harbor.
This is what Caesar feared. So while his enemies were engaged in battle,
he captured Pharos with disembarked soldiers and posted a garrison there.
And by this it was brought about that grain and reinforcements
could be safely transported to him on ships.
For he sent off to all nearby provinces and summoned reinforcements from them.
In the rest of town the battle raged equally, so that neither side retreated
or was beaten (the confined passages of the place caused this) and with few men
killed
Caesar fortified the surrounding positions chiefly, of necessity, by night.
In that tract of town a small part was of the palace,
in which he himself had been introduced for a residence,
and a theater adjoining the house that he held as a stronghold position.
He also had an approach to the harbor and to the rest of the docks.
He added to these fortifications in the subsequent days,
so that he could hold the exposed fortifications before the wall
and not be forced to fight against his will.
In the meantime, the younger daughter of King Ptolomy,
hoping for the empty possession of the kingdom,
betook herself from the palace to Achillas and began to manage the war by
herself. 
But a dispute quickly rose between them about the leadership;
which increased the largess among the soldiers;
for only by great cost to oneself could the heart of any one of them be won over.
