12.1 Recepto Caesar Orico nulla interposita mora Apolloniam
proficiscitur.  Cuius adventu audito L. Staberius, qui ibi praeerat,
aquam comportare in arcem atque eam munire obsidesque ab
Apolloniatibus exigere coepit.  Illi vero daturos se negare, neque
portas consuli praeclusuros, neque sibi iudicium sumpturos contra
atque omnis Italia populusque Romanus indicavisset.  Quorum cognita
voluntate clam profugit Apollonia Staberius.  Illi ad Caesarem
legatos mittunt oppidoque recipiunt.  Hos sequuntur Bullidenses,
Amantini et reliquae finitimae civitates totaque Epiros et legatis ad
Caesarem missis, quae imperaret, facturos pollicentur.


After taking Oricum, Caesar brooked no delay before setting out for
Apollonia.  L. Staberius, who was in command there, took note of his
arrival and began to transport water into the citadel and to fortify
it, and to exact hostages from the Apollonians.  But they refused to
surrender to him, or to close their gates to the consul, or to take
up the judgement against what all Italy and the Roman people had
indicated.  And recognizing their desire Staberius fled Apollonia on
the sly.  The townspeople sent envoys to Caesar and accepted him
into the town.  The Bullidensians, the Amantinians and the rest of
the neighboring cities and all Epiros followed them, and promised,
by means of legates that were sent to Caesar, to do whatever he
commanded.
