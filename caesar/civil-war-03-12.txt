12.1
Recepto Caesar Orico nulla interposita mora Apolloniam proficiscitur.

Cuius adventu audito L. Staberius, qui ibi praeerat,
aquam comportare in arcem atque eam munire
obsidesque ab Apolloniatibus exigere coepit.

Illi vero daturos se negare,
neque portas consuli praeclusuros,
neque sibi iudicium sumpturos contra atque omnis Italia populusque Romanus
indicavisset.

Quorum cognita voluntate clam profugit Apollonia Staberius.

Illi ad Caesarem legatos mittunt oppidoque recipiunt.

Hos sequuntur Bullidenses, Amantini et reliquae finitimae civitates
totaque Epiros et legatis ad Caesarem missis,
quae imperaret, facturos pollicentur.


After taking Oricum, Caesar brooked no delay before setting out for Apollonia.

L. Staberius, who was in command there, took note of his arrival
and began to transport water into the citadel and to fortify it, and
to exact hostages from the Apollonians.

But they refused to give themselves up,
or to close the gates to the consul,
or to selves of judges to take up against and all Italy and Roman people he
might have indicated.

And recognizing their desire/will Staberius fled Apollonia on the sly.

Envoys were sent to Caesar and were accepted by the town.

The Bullidenses, the Amantini and the rest of the neighboring cities
and all Epiros followed these
 and by means of legates that were sent to Caesar,
 they promised to do whatever he commanded.
