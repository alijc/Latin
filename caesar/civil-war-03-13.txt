13.1
At Pompeius cognitis his rebus,
quae erant Orici atque Apolloniae gestae,
Dyrrachio timens diurnis eo nocturnisque itineribus contendit.
Simul Caesar appropinquare dicebatur,
tantusque terror incidit eius exercitui,
quod properans noctem diei coniunxerat neque iter intermiserat,
ut paene omnes ex Epiro finitimisque regionibus signa relinquerent,
complures arma proicerent ac fugae simile iter videretur.
Sed cum prope Dyrrachium Pompeius constitisset castraque metari iussisset,
perterrito etiam tum exercitu princeps Labienus procedit iuratque se eum non
deserturum eundemque casum subiturum, quemcumque ei fortuna tribuisset.
Hoc idem reliqui iurant legati;
tribuni militum centurionesque sequuntur,
atque idem omnis exercitus iurat.

Caesar praeoccupato itinere ad Dyrrachium finem properandi facit
castraque ad flumen Apsum ponit in finibus Apolloniatium,
ut bene meritae civitates tutae essent praesidio,
ibique reliquarum ex Italia legionum adventum exspectare
et sub pellibus hiemare constituit.

Hoc idem Pompeius fecit et trans flumen Apsum positis castris eo copias omnes auxiliaque conduxit.


But when Pompey learned of what had happened at Oricum and Apollonia,
he extended his marches by night and day, in fear for Dyrrachium.

Meanwhile, it was said that Caesar was drawing near,
and such a panic fell upon Pompey's army,
that in a hurry they joined night to day without interrupting their march,
so that they abandoned nearly all the battle standards from Epiros and the
neighboring regions, threw away most of their arms, and the march
seemed to turn into flight.

But after Pompey had come to a halt near Dyrrachium
and ordered a camp to be marked out,
with the army still terrified, First Officer Labienus came up 
and swore that he wouldn't desert him
but would undergo the same fate as him, whatever fortune might grant.

The rest of the officers swore the same;
the military tribunes and centurions followed suit,
and the whole army swore likewise.

Caesar made an end to hurrying with an anticipated march to Dyrrachium,
and pitched a camp at the Apsum River within the borders of Apollonia,
so that well deserved cities had been protected by a garrison,
and there he arranged to wait for the arrival of the rest of the legions from
Italy, and to winter over under shelter.

Pompey did the same, and after pitching his camp on the other side of the river
drew together all his troops and auxilaries.
