7.1 Quibus rebus neque tum respondendum Caesar existimavit, neque
nunc, ut memoriae prodantur, satis causae putamus.  Postulabat
Caesar, ut legatos sibi ad Pompeium sine periculo mittere liceret,
idque ipsi fore reciperent aut acceptos per se ad eum perducerent.
Quod ad indutias pertineret, sic belli rationem esse divisam, ut
illi classe naves auxiliaque sua impedirent, ipse ut aqua terraque
eos prohiberet.  Si hoc sibi remitti vellent, remitterent ipsi de
maritimis custodiis; si illud tenerent, se quoque id retenturum.
Nihilo minus tamen agi posse de compositione, ut haec non
remitterentur, neque hanc rem illi esse impedimento.  Libo neque
legatos Caesaris recipere neque periculum praestare eorum, sed
totam rem ad Pompeium reicere: unum instare de indutiis
vehementissimeque contendere.  Quem ubi Caesar intellexit
praesentis periculi atque inopiae vitandae causa omnem orationem
instituisse neque ullam spem aut condicionem pacis afferre, ad
reliquam cogitationem belli sese recepit.


Caesar didn't think it worth his while to respond to these matters
then, nor do we consider it weighty enough to hand down to memory
now.  Caesar demanded that he be allowed to send his envoys to
Pompey in safety, and that they should either undertake to see to
this, or should themselves receive these men and conduct them to
him.  And pertaining to a truce: that the reckoning of the war was
tallied up thusly: that they obstructed his ships and auxiliaries
with their fleet, and he himself barred them from water and land.
If they wished to get this concession, then they should relax
their own coastal watch; if they kept it, he himself would keep
his as well.  That nevertheless, nothing at all could be done
about an agreement unless concessions were made, and this matter
should not be an impediment to that.  Libo said that he would
neither accept Caesar's envoys nor be responsible for their
safety, but would throw the whole matter to Pompey: he
unilaterally insisted on a truce, and pressed this most
vigorously.  And then Caesar understood that, due to the need to
escape their current danger, he had fabricated the entire speech,
and that he brought not the faintest hope or proposal of peace, he
fell back upon his former plan of waging war.
