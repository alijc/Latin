18.1
Bibulus multos dies terra prohibitus et graviore morbo ex frigore et labore implicitus,
cum neque curari posset neque susceptum officium deserere vellet,
vim morbi sustinere non potuit.
Eo mortuo ad neminem unum summa imperii redit,
sed separatim suam quisque classem ad arbitrium suum administrabat.
Vibullius sedato tumultu,
quem repentinus adventus Caesaris concitaverat,
ubi primum e re visum est,
adhibito Libone et L. Lucceio et Theophane,
quibuscum communicare de maximis rebus Pompeius consueverat,
de mandatis Caesaris agere instituit.
Quem ingressum in sermonem Pompeius interpellavit et loqui plura prohibuit.

"Quid mihi," inquit, "aut vita aut civitate opus est,
quam beneficio Caesaris habere videbor?
cuius rei opinio tolli non poterit,
cum in Italiam,
ex qua profectus sum reductus existimabor bello perfecto."

Ab eis Caesar haec facta cognovit, qui sermoni interfuerunt;
conatus tamen nihilo minus est aliis rationibus per colloquia de pace agere.


Bibulus, prevented from landing for many days, and beset by serious illness
from the cold and exertion,
since he could not be cured, and had no wish to abandon his accepted duty,
could not sustain the power of his illness.
After he died, ultimate command reverted to no single man,
but each one managed his own fleet according to his own judgment.
Vibullius,
after settling the confusion that the sudden arrival of Caesar had stirred up,
when he first appeared from the matter,
summoned Libo and L Lucceius and Theophan*,
with whom Pompey had been wont to discuss the most important matters,
and prepared to act on Caesar's demands.
But Pompey prevented him from entering into a discussion and forbade him to
speak further.

"Of what use is it to me," he said, "either by life or by city,
than I will seem to hold by/to Caesar's benefit?
of/to whose business the belief/opinion to be taken/raised not he/it will be
able,
when into Italy,
out of which I have departed having been restored I will be valued by/to
completed war."

By them Caesar these facts/deeds learned of, who took part in the discussion;
yet the attempt to/by nothing less is to/by other accounts/plans through parley
about peace to urge/act.
