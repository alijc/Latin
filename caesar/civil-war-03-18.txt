18.1 Bibulus multos dies terra prohibitus et graviore morbo ex
frigore et labore implicitus, cum neque curari posset neque
susceptum officium deserere vellet, vim morbi sustinere non
potuit.  Eo mortuo ad neminem unum summa imperii redit, sed
separatim suam quisque classem ad arbitrium suum administrabat.
Vibullius sedato tumultu, quem repentinus adventus Caesaris
concitaverat, ubi primum e re visum est, adhibito Libone et
L. Lucceio et Theophane, quibuscum communicare de maximis rebus
Pompeius consueverat, de mandatis Caesaris agere instituit.  Quem
ingressum in sermonem Pompeius interpellavit et loqui plura
prohibuit.  "Quid mihi," inquit, "aut vita aut civitate opus est,
quam beneficio Caesaris habere videbor?  cuius rei opinio tolli
non poterit, cum in Italiam, ex qua profectus sum reductus
existimabor bello perfecto."  Ab eis Caesar haec facta cognovit,
qui sermoni interfuerunt; conatus tamen nihilo minus est aliis
rationibus per colloquia de pace agere.


Bibulus was prevented from landing for many days, and beset with
a serious illness from the cold and exertion.  Since he could not
be cured, and yet refused to abandon his appointed duty, he
succumbed to his illness.  After he died, ultimate command
reverted to no single man, but each one managed his own fleet
according to his own judgment.  After the confusion that the
sudden arrival of Caesar had stirred up when he first returned
settled down, Vibullius summoned Libo and L Lucceius and Theophanes,
with whom Pompey had been wont to discuss the most important
matters, and prepared to act on Caesar's demands.  But Pompey
interrupted him partway through his speech and forbade him to
speak further.  "Of what use is either life or citizenship to
me," he said, "if I appear to hold it by Caesar's mercy?  And his
opinion of the matter cannot be lifted, when I am judged, having
been returned to Italy, which I departed from."  When the war was
over, Caesar learned of these facts from those who took part in
the discussion; yet nevertheless he tried to press for peace
talks through other avenues.
