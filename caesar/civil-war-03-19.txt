19.1
Inter bina castra Pompei atque Caesaris unum flumen tantum intererat Apsus,
crebraque inter se colloquia milites habebant,
neque ullum interim telum per pactiones loquentium traiciebatur.
Mittit P. Vatinium legatum ad ripam ipsam fluminis, qui ea,
quae maxime ad pacem pertinere viderentur,
ageret et crebro magna voce pronuntiaret,
liceretne civibus ad cives de pace legatos mittere,
quod etiam fugitivis ab saltu Pyrenaeo praedonibusque licuisset,
praesertim eum id agerent, ne cives cum civibus armis decertarent?
Multa suppliciter locutus est,
ut de sua atque omnium salute debebat,
silentioque ab utrisque militibus auditus.
Responsum est ab altera parte Aulum Varronem profiteri se altera die ad
colloquium venturum atque una visurum,
quemadmodum tuto legati venire et quae vellent exponere possent;
certumque ei rei tempus constituitur.
Quo cum esset postero die ventum,
magna utrimque multitudo convenit,
magnaque erat exspectatio eius rei,
atque omnium animi intenti esse ad pacem videbantur.
Qua ex frequentia, Titus Labienus prodit,
sed missa oratione de pace, loqui atque altercari cum Vatinio incipit.
Quorum mediam orationem interrumpunt subito undique tela immissa;
quae ille obtectus armis militum vitavit;
vulnerantur tamen complures,
in his Cornelius Balbus, M. Plotius, L. Tiburtius,
centuriones militesque nonnulli.
Tum Labienus:
"desinite ergo de compositione loqui;
nam nobis nisi Caesaris capite relato pax esse nulla potest."


Only a single river, the Apsus, lay between the two camps of Pompey and Caesar,
and the soldiers were holding constant parleys with the other side,
and, by agreement, no weapon was transfixing the conversations.
Caesar sent the envoy P. Vatinius right up to the river-bank,
to do what seemed to greatly relate to peace,
and to repeatedly announce in a loud voice,
that shouldn't citizens be allowed to send peace delegations to fellow citizens,
what had been permitted to even deserters and thieves by the Pyrenan pass,
especially since they might prevent citizens from fighting under arms with their
fellow citizens?
He said much, in a humble entreaty,
as he ought to have, considering his own, and every man's, safety,
and was heard by soldiers in silence on both sides.
He was answered from the other side, that Aulus Varronus declared that he
would come and visit for a parley on some other day,
when the envoys would be able to safely com and set forth what the wanted;
and a time for the business was determined.
And after he came on the next day,
a great multitude assembled from both sides,
and they had high expectations for the matter,
and the hearts of all seemed to hold out for peace.
And Titus Labienus advanced from the crowd,
but commenced to speak with Vatinius and argue with him,
disregarding his speech about peace.
But his speech was suddenly interrupted in the middle when spears were hurled in
from both sides.
He escaped these, protected by the shields of the soldiers;
nevertheless many were wounded, among whom were Cornelius Balbus, M. Plotius,
L. Tiburtius, and several centurions and soldiers. 
Then Labienus said:
"Now stop talking about an agreement;
for unless the head of Caesar is brought to us, there can be no peace."
