20.1
Eisdem temporibus M. Caelius Rufus praetor causa debitorum suscepta initio
magistratus tribunal suum iuxta C. Treboni,
praetoris urbani,
sellam collocavit et,
si quis appellavisset de aestimatione et de solutionibus,
quae per arbitrum fierent, ut Caesar praesens constituerat,
fore auxilio pollicebatur.

Sed fiebat aequitate decreti et humanitate Treboni,
qui his temporibus clementer et moderate ius dicendum existimabat,
ut reperiri non possent,
a quibus initium appellandi nasceretur.

Nam fortasse inopiam excusare et calamitatem aut propriam suam aut temporum
queri et difficultates auctionandi proponere etiam mediocris est animi;
integras vero tenere possessiones,
qui se debere fateantur,
cuius animi aut cuius impudentiae est?

Itaque, hoc qui postularet reperiebatur nemo.

Atque ipsis, ad quorum commodum pertinebat, durior inventus est Caelius.

Et ab hoc profectus initio,
ne frustra ingressus turpem causam videretur,
legem promulgavit,
ut sexenni die sine usuris creditae pecuniae solvantur.


at the same times Praetor M. Caelius Rufus for the sake/by reason of debts
having undertaken the onset the magistracy his tribunal nearly of C. Trebonus,
the city praetor,
positioned sedan chair and,
if anyone had called abt the estimation and about the payments,
which through arbiters might have been made, as Caesar at hand had resolved,
to be going to be an aid he promised.

But he/it was happening in justice of settled/a decree and by Trebonus'
courtesy,
who in these times mercifully and restrainedly the law ought to be declared he
judged,
so that they could not be obtained,
by which the beginning of those who would be called he might be formed.

For perhaps >lack to excuse and >loss or his particular or of times
to protest and difficulties for holding an auction to propose still of medium is
to the mind;
>untouched tryly to hold possessions,
those who admitted it to themselves,
of whose mind or of whose effrontery is?

And so, he who might demand this no one was learning.

Abd to/by themselves, to whose advantage he was extending, Caelius was found to
be sterner.

And having set out from this in the beginning,
lest in vain having advance >the ugly subject might seem,
he proclaimed the law,
so that six years old on the day without interest loans money were loosened.
