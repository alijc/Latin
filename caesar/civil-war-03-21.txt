[21]
Cum resisteret Servilius consul reliquique magistratus,
et minus opinione sua efficeret,
ad hominum excitanda studia sublata priore lege duas promulgavit:
unam, qua mercedes habitationum annuas conductoribus donavit,
aliam tabularum novarum,
impetuque multitudinis in C. Trebonium facto
et nonnullis vulneratis eum de tribunali deturbavit.

De quibus rebus Servilius consul ad senatum rettulit,
senatusque Caelium ab re publica removendum censuit.

Hoc decreto eum consul senatu prohibuit et contionari conantem de rostris deduxit.

Ille ignominia et dolore permotus palam se proficisci ad Caesarem simulavit;
clam nuntiis ad Milonem missis,
qui Clodio interfecto eo nomine erat damnatus,
atque eo in Italiam evocato,
quod magnis muneribus datis gladiatoriae familiae reliquias habebat,
sibi coniiunxit atque eum in Thurinum ad sollicitandos pastores praemisit.

Ipse cum Casilinum venisset,
unoque tempore signa eius militaria atque arma Capuae essent comprensa
et familia Neapoli visa,
quae proditionem oppidi appararet,
patefactis consiliis exclusus Capua et periculum veritus,
quod conventus arma ceperat
atque eum hostis loco habendum existimabat,
consilio destitit atque eo itinere sese avertit.


When the magistrate and remaining consul Servilius paused,
and brought about less than/by his opinion/idea,
to/at of men the arousing of zeals having been endured by/to the earlier law
two(f) proclaimed:
one(f), which granted annual payments for lodgings to/by renters,
the other(f) of new/fresh deeds,
and after an attack was made on C. Treboniusby a mob
and he drove him away from the tribunal with several wounded.

The consul Servilius reported these things to the senate,
and the senate decreed the expulsion of Caelius from the republic.
After this resolution, the consul prohibited him from the senate and
forcibly removed him from the rostra, where he'd intended to make a speech.

He, moved by disgrace and anguish, publicly pretended that he was going over to
Caesar;
secretly having sent messengers to Milo,
who to/by Clodius having been killed by him/the name had been condemned,
and him into Italy having been summoned,
that/because great bribes having been given to a gladitorial house >remains he
was having,
to self he conjoined and him in Thurinum to the agitating shepherds he sent
ahead.

When he had come with Casilius,
and at one time a his standards and arms of Capua were embraced and the family
of Naples were seen/visited,
which betrayal of the town he might make ready,
the plans having been disclosed plans having shut off from Capua and having
feared danger,
that/because having agreed he took up arms
and him enemy/ies to/by the place for having he supposed,
by advice he stopped and turned aside from his route.
