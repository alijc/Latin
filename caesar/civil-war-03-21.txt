[21]
Cum resisteret Servilius consul reliquique magistratus,
et minus opinione sua efficeret,
ad hominum excitanda studia sublata priore lege duas promulgavit:
unam, qua mercedes habitationum annuas conductoribus donavit,
aliam tabularum novarum,
impetuque multitudinis in C. Trebonium facto
et nonnullis vulneratis eum de tribunali deturbavit.
De quibus rebus Servilius consul ad senatum rettulit,
senatusque Caelium ab re publica removendum censuit.
Hoc decreto eum consul senatu prohibuit et contionari conantem de rostris deduxit.
Ille ignominia et dolore permotus palam se proficisci ad Caesarem simulavit;
clam nuntiis ad Milonem missis,
qui Clodio interfecto eo nomine erat damnatus,
atque eo in Italiam evocato,
quod magnis muneribus datis gladiatoriae familiae reliquias habebat,
sibi coniiunxit atque eum in Thurinum ad sollicitandos pastores praemisit.
Ipse cum Casilinum venisset,
unoque tempore signa eius militaria atque arma Capuae essent comprensa
et familia Neapoli visa,
quae proditionem oppidi appararet,
patefactis consiliis exclusus Capua et periculum veritus,
quod conventus arma ceperat
atque eum hostis loco habendum existimabat,
consilio destitit atque eo itinere sese avertit.


Since the consul Servilius and the rest of the magistrates were in opposition,
and he'd accomplished less than he'd hoped for,
Caelius proposed two new laws to arouse men's spirits,
which had been lifted by the earlier law:
one, which granted annual payments to renters for their lodgings,
and the other a clean slate.
And in an attack on C. Trebonius with the help of a mob,
he drove him away from the tribunal with several wounded.
The consul Servilius reported these things to the senate,
and the senate decreed the removal of Caelius from the republic.
After this resolution, the consul barred him from the senate and
forcibly removed him from the rostra, where he'd intended to make a speech.
Moved by disgrace and anguish, he openly pretended to be going over to Caesar;
but secretly sent messengers to Milo,
who had been condemned for inciting the murder of Clodius,
summoning him back to Italy,
that, having put on great spectacles with what was left of his personal
gladiators.
Milo signed on and Caelius sent him ahead to Thurinum, to stir up the shepherds.
He himself went to Casilium,
and at once his standards and arms were seized at Capua
and his household at Naples,
and it was seen that they were getting ready to betray the town.
With his plans exposed, shut out of Capua and facing danger,
because a throng had taken up arms
and held him to be an enemy to the place,
he gave up on his plan and turned aside from his route.
