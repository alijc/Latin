22.1 Interim Milo dimissis circum municipia litteris, se ea, quae
faceret, iussu atque imperio facere Pompei, quae mandata ad se per
Vibullium delata essent, quos ex aere alieno laborare arbitrabatur,
sollicitabat.  Apud quos cum proficere nihil posset, quibusdam solutis
ergastulis Cosam in agro Thurino oppugnare coepit.  Eo cum a Q. Pedio
praetore cum legione . . . lapide ictus ex muro periit.  Et Caelius
profectus, ut dictitabat, ad Caesarem pervenit Thurios.  Ubi cum
quosdam eius municipii sollicitaret equitibusque Caesaris Gallis atque
Hispanis, qui eo praesidii causa missi erant, pecuniam polliceretur,
ab his est interfectus.  Ita magnarum initia rerum, quae occupatione
magistratuum et temporum sollicitam Italiam habebant, celerem et
facilem exitum habuerunt.


In the meantime Milo, after sending letters off around the towns,
saying that what he did was fulfilling Pompey's command and authority,
which had been brought to him by Vibullius.  He stirred up those who
he thought were oppressed by other people's money.  When he could
accomplish nothing there, he set a few slaves free and commenced a
siege of Cosa on Thurian soil.  Therefore when by praetor Q. Pedius
with a legion...  he perished after being struck by a stone flung from
the wall.  And with Caelius having gone, as he maintained, to Caesar,
he came to Thurium, where, after stirring up some of his towns and
promising money to Caesar's Gallic and Spanish cavalry, who'd been
come there as Caesar's bodyguard, he was killed by them.  Thus the
beginnings of the great matters that kept Italy troubled, due to the
unrest of the magistrates and the times, came to a swift and easy end.
