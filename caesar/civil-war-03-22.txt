22.1
Interim Milo dimissis circum municipia litteris,
se ea, quae faceret, iussu atque imperio facere Pompei,
quae mandata ad se per Vibullium delata essent,
quos ex aere alieno laborare arbitrabatur, sollicitabat.

Apud quos cum proficere nihil posset,
quibusdam solutis ergastulis Cosam in agro Thurino oppugnare coepit.

Eo cum a Q. Pedio praetore cum legione . . . lapide ictus ex muro periit.

Et Caelius profectus, ut dictitabat, ad Caesarem pervenit Thurios.

Ubi cum quosdam eius municipii sollicitaret
equitibusque Caesaris Gallis atque Hispanis,
qui eo praesidii causa missi erant, pecuniam polliceretur,
ab his est interfectus.

Ita magnarum initia rerum,
quae occupatione magistratuum et temporum sollicitam Italiam habebant,
celerem et facilem exitum habuerunt.


In the meantime Milo, after sending letters off around the town,
worried about what he could do to act according to Pompeys orders and commands
that had been carried to him through Vibullius,
and that he thought to work out with someone else's money.

When he could nothing accomplish at those/there,
he freed certain convicts and began to do battle with Cosa on Thurian soil.

Therefore when by praetor Q. Pedius with a legion...
he perished after being struck by a stone flung from the wall.

And with Caelius gone, as he repeated, Thurios reached Caesar.

Where, after stirring up some of his towns and promising money
to Caesar's Gallic and Spanish cavalry, who'd been sent there as his bodyguard,
he was killed by them.

Thus of great things from the beginning,
which by employing the magistrates and conditions they held a troubled Italy,
>swift and easy Italy? they had an end.
