24.1
Erat eo tempore Antonius Brundisii;
is virtute militum confisus scaphas navium magnarum circiter LX cratibus
pluteisque contexit
eoque milites delectos imposuit
atque eas in litore pluribus locis separatim disposuit navesque triremes duas,
quas Brundisii faciendas curaverat,
per causam exercendorum remigum ad fauces portus prodire iussit.
Has cum audacius progressas Libo vidisset,
sperans intercipi posse, quadriremes V ad eas misit.
Quae cum navibus nostris appropinquassent,
nostri veterani in portum refugiebant:
illi studio incitati incautius sequebantur.
Iam ex omnibus partibus subito Antonianae scaphae signo dato se in hostes incitaverunt
primoque impeto unam ex his quadriremibus cum remigibus defensoribusque suis ceperunt,
reliquas turpiter refugere coegerunt.
Ad hoc detrimentum accessit,
ut equitibus per oram maritimam ab Antonio dispositis aquari prohiberentur.
Qua necessitate et ignominia permotus Libo discessit a Brundisio obsessionemque nostrorum omisit.


Anthony was at Brundisium at the time,
and had the confidence of the men of his army;
he concealed the lighters of around 60 large ships with wickerwork and
breastworks and positioned elite soldiers there
and distributed the ships and two triremes on shore in many places.
He had arranged the triremes to be built in Brundisium in order to
give his oarsmen practice in navigating the harbor's narrow passages.
And now he ordered them to come out to sea.
After Libo saw these boldly issuing forth
he sent 5 quadriremes against them,
in hopes that he could intercept them.
And when they'd gotten close to our ships,
our experienced soldiers would flee back into the harbor:
they, urged on with zeal, would incautiously pursue us.
And then suddenly, when the signal was given, 
Anthony's lighters aroused themselves from every side against the enemy,
in the first assault they captured one of these quadriremes,
along with its oarsmen and fighters,
and forced the the rest to flee in chaos.
He added to this defeat,
so that they'd be kept from fetching water by the cavalry that
Anthony had positions along the seashore.
And Libo, agitated by this difficulty and dishonor,
withdrew from Brundisium and raised the blockade from our positions.
