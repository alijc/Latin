25.1
Multi iam menses erant et hiems praecipitaverat,
neque Brundisio naves legionesque ad Caesarem veniebant.

Ac nonnullae eius rei praetermissae occasiones Caesari videbantur,
quod certi saepe flaverant venti,
quibus necessario committendum existimabat.

Quantoque eius amplius processerat temporis,
tanto erant alacriores ad custodias,
qui classibus praeerant,
maioremque fiduciam prohibendi habebant,
et crebris Pompei litteris castigabantur,
quoniam primo venientem Caesarem non prohibuissent,
ut reliquos eius exercitus impedirent,
duriusque cotidie tempus ad transportandum lenioribus ventis exspectabant.

Quibus rebus permotus Caesar Brundisium ad suos severius scripsit,
nacti idoneum ventum ne occasionem navigandi dimitterent,
sive ad litora Apolloniatium [sive ad Labeatium] cursum dirigere
atque eo naves eicere possent.

Haec a custodiis classium loca maxime vacabant,
quod se longius a portibus committere non audebant.


They'd been there for many months now and winter had fallen,
and no ships and legions were coming to Caesar in Brundisium.

And some things seemed to Caesar to have been missed opportunities,
because certain winds had often blown,
that he thought were necessaty for bringing about.

and by how much his greater he had advanced of time,
so much were keener to defenses,
who commanded fleets,
and >more confidence for preventing they had,
and to/by constant of Pompey letters they were reprimanding,
since at first arriving Caesar not they had prevented,
in order to obstruct the rest of his army,
and harder daily weather to transporting by lighter winds they waited for.

by which things disturbed Caesar wrote to Brundisium to his men more sternly,
of/having obtained a favorable wind lest >opportunity for sailing they might
forgo,
to the shore either at Apolloniatium or at Labeatium set course
and there ships might be able to perform.

these things by the watch of the fleet spots especially were vacant,
because selves longer from ports to bring about they didn't dare.
