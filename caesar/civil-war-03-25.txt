25.1
Multi iam menses erant et hiems praecipitaverat,
neque Brundisio naves legionesque ad Caesarem veniebant.

Ac nonnullae eius rei praetermissae occasiones Caesari videbantur,
quod certi saepe flaverant venti,
quibus necessario committendum existimabat.

Quantoque eius amplius processerat temporis,
tanto erant alacriores ad custodias,
qui classibus praeerant,
maioremque fiduciam prohibendi habebant,
et crebris Pompei litteris castigabantur,
quoniam primo venientem Caesarem non prohibuissent,
ut reliquos eius exercitus impedirent,
duriusque cotidie tempus ad transportandum lenioribus ventis exspectabant.

Quibus rebus permotus Caesar Brundisium ad suos severius scripsit,
nacti idoneum ventum ne occasionem navigandi dimitterent,
sive ad litora Apolloniatium [sive ad Labeatium] cursum dirigere
atque eo naves eicere possent.

Haec a custodiis classium loca maxime vacabant,
quod se longius a portibus committere non audebant.


They'd been there for many months now and winter had rushed in,
and there were no ships or legions coming to Caesar in Brundisium.

And it seemed to Caesar that they'd missed some opportunities,
because certain winds had often been blowing,
that he thought were necessary for joining up/battle.

And however much the season advanced,
the fleet commanders were that much sharper at the watch,
and had greater confidence for their defense,
and were being chastized from frequent letters from Pompey,
since they hadn't staved Caesar off when he first arrived,
to obstruct the rest of his armies,
and, as the season grew harsher day by day, they were waiting for gentler winds
to carry them across.

Disturbed by these matters, Caesar wrote to his men in Brundisium more sternly,
that, if they obtained a favorable wind, they shouldn't let slip the chance of
sailing - that they could set course for the shore at either Apolloniatium or
Labeatium and there drive the ships out.

These locations were particularly lacking the fleets' protection,
because they no longer dared to expose themselves from the harbors.
