26.1 Illi adhibita audacia et virtute administrantibus M. Antonio et
Fufio Caleno, multum ipsis militibus hortantibus neque ullum
periculum pro salute Caesaris recusantibus nacti austrum naves
solvunt atque altero die Apolloniam praetervehuntur.  Qui cum essent
ex continenti visi, Coponius, qui Dyrrachii classi Rhodiae praeerat,
naves ex portu educit, et cum iam nostris remissiore vento
appropinquasset, idem auster increbuit nostrisque praesidio fuit.
Neque vero ille ob eam causam conatu desistebat, sed labore et
perseverantia nautarum etiam vim tempestatis superari posse sperabat
praetervectosque Dyrrachium magna vi venti nihilo secius sequebatur.
Nostri usi fortunae beneficio tamen impetum classis timebant, si
forte ventus remisisset.  Nacti portum, qui appellatur Nymphaeum,
ultra Lissum milia passuum III, eo naves introduxerunt (qui portus
ab Africo tegebatur, ab austro non erat tutus) leviusque tempestatis
quam classis periculum aestimaverunt.  Quo simulatque introitum est,
incredibili felicitate auster, qui per biduum flaverat, in Africum
se vertit.


They screwed up their courage, and, under the direction of
M. Antonius and Fufius Calenus, who themselves strongly urged the
soldiers on, and refusing no danger for the sake of Caesar's safety,
they launched the ships on the next south wind and sailed passed
Apollonia on the next day.  And when they were seen from the
mainland, Coponius, who commanded the Rhodian fleet at Dyrrachium,
drew his ships out of the harbor on a slack wind, and after he had
already gotten close to our ships, that same south wind strengthened
again, to aid us.  But, to be sure, he didn't leave off the attempt
on this account, but hoped that the force of the weather could still
be overcome through the labor and persistence of his sailors, and
kept pursuing us, who had passed by Dyrrachium through the great
power of the wind, and nothing else.  Our men, having made good use
of their lucky break, nevertheless feared an attack of the fleet, if
the wind chanced to diminish.  When they reached the harbor that was
called Nymphaeum, more than three miles from Lissus, they brought
the ships in there (this harbor was protected from the southwest
wind, but not from the south wind) and they reckoned that the risk
from the weather was less than from the fleet.  And, by
extraordinary good fortune, as soon as they entered the harbor the
south wind, which had been blowing for two days, turned back to the
southwest.
