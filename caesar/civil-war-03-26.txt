26.1
Illi adhibita audacia et virtute administrantibus M. Antonio et Fufio Caleno,
multum ipsis militibus hortantibus
neque ullum periculum pro salute Caesaris recusantibus nacti austrum naves solvunt
atque altero die Apolloniam praetervehuntur.
Qui cum essent ex continenti visi,
Coponius, qui Dyrrachii classi Rhodiae praeerat,
naves ex portu educit,
et cum iam nostris remissiore vento appropinquasset,
idem auster increbuit nostrisque praesidio fuit.
Neque vero ille ob eam causam conatu desistebat,
sed labore et perseverantia nautarum etiam vim tempestatis superari posse sperabat
praetervectosque Dyrrachium magna vi venti nihilo secius sequebatur.
Nostri usi fortunae beneficio tamen impetum classis timebant,
si forte ventus remisisset.
Nacti portum, qui appellatur Nymphaeum,
ultra Lissum milia passuum III,
eo naves introduxerunt
(qui portus ab Africo tegebatur, ab austro non erat tutus)
leviusque tempestatis quam classis periculum aestimaverunt.
Quo simulatque introitum est, incredibili felicitate auster,
qui per biduum flaverat, in Africum se vertit.


They screwed up their courage, and, with M. Antonius and Fufius Calenus
directing, strongly exhorting the soldiers in person,
and refusing no danger for Caesar's safety,
when they obtained a south wind they launched the ships 
and sailed passed Apollonia on the next day.
And when they were seen from the mainland,
Coponius, who the commanded the Rhodian fleet at Dyrrachium,
drew his ships out of the harbor,
and after he had sailed on a mild wind and was already close to our ships,
that same south wind strengthened, to our aid.
And, indeed, he didn't halt his attempt on this account,
but hoped that the force could still to be overcome through the labor and persistence of his sailors,
and used the great power of the wind, and nothing else, to make for Dyrrachium. 
Our men, having made good use of their lucky break, nevertheless feared an
attack of the fleet, if the wind chanced to diminish.
When the reached the port, which was called Nymphaeum,
more than three miles from Lissus,
they brought the ships in there
(this harbor was protected from Africa, but not from the south wind)
and they reckoned that the risk from the weather was less than from the fleet.
And, by extraordinary good fortune, as soon as they entered the harbor the
south wind, which had been blowing for two days, turned back to Africa.
