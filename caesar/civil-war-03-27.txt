27.1
Hic subitam commutationem fortunae videre licuit.
Qui modo sibi timuerant, hos tutissimus portus recipiebat;
qui nostris navibus periculum intulerant, de suo timere cogebantur.
Itaque tempore commutato tempestas et nostros texit et naves Rhodias afflixit,
ita ut ad unam omnes, constratae numero XVI,
eliderentur et naufragio interirent,
et ex magno remigum propugnatorumque
numero pars ad scopulos allisa interficeretur,
pars ab nostris detraheretur;
quos omnes conservatos Caesar domum dimisit.


In these circumstances it was permitted to see the sudden reversal of fortune.
Those who had only feared for themselves,
the well-protected harbor had taken them in;
those who had brought peril to our ships,
were being driven/compelled from their own fear.
And so, after the weather completely altered,
it both protected our men and wrecked the Rhodian ships,
so that, to a ship all, including 16 decked ships,
were destroyed and perished in shipwrecks,
and of the great number of oarsmen and fighters,
some were dashed on the rocks and killed, and others dragged off by our men.
Caesar sent all of them who survived home.
