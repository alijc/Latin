28.1
Nostrae naves duae tardius cursu confecto in noctem coniectae,
cum ignorarent, quem locum reliquae cepissent,
contra Lissum in ancoris constiterunt.
Has scaphis minoribusque navigiis compluribus immissis Otacilius Crassus,
qui Lissi praeerat, expugnare parabat;
simul de deditione eorum agebat et incolumitatem deditis pollicebatur.
Harum altera navis CCXX e legione tironum sustulerat,
altera ex veterana paulo minus CC.
Hic cognosci licuit, quantum esset hominibus praesidii in animi firmitudine.
Tirones enim multitudine navium perterriti et salo nauseaque confecti
iureiurando accepto,
nihil eis nocituros hostes, se Otacilio dediderunt;
qui omnes ad eum producti contra religionem iurisiurandi in eius conspectu
crudelissime interficiuntur.
At veteranae legionis milites,
item conflictati et tempestatis et sentinae vitiis,
neque ex pristina virtute remittendum aliquid putaverunt,
et tractandis condicionibus et simulatione deditionis extracto primo noctis
tempore gubernatorem in terram navem eicere cogunt,
ipsi idoneum locum nacti reliquam noctis partem ibi confecerunt et luce prima
missis ad eos ab Otacilio equitibus,
qui eam partem orae maritimae asservabant,
circiter CCCC, quique eos armati ex praesidio secuti sunt,
se defenderunt et nonnullis eorum interfectis incolumes se ad nostros receperunt.


Two of our ships, thrown together until nightfall
because they'd been slower in preparing for the voyage,
set anchor opposite Lissus,
since they didn't know which site the others had taken possession of.

Otacilius Crassus, who was in command at Lissus,
prepared for battle, sending many skiffs and small vessels against these ships;
at the same time he was pursuing their surrender
and promising safety to those who gave themselves up.

One of these ships was carrying 220 fresh recruits from the legion,
while the other a few less than 200 veterans.

Here one could learn as much as possible
from men on defense and strength of spirit.

For the recruits, terrified by the great number of ships and done in
by billows and sea-sickness, took his oath at face value and,
thinking that the enemy would do them no harm,
gave themselves up to Otacilius.
And they were all led up to him and, contrary to the sanctity of his oath,
were most cruelly killed in his sight.

But the soldiers of the veteran legions,
likewise tormented by the crimes of both storm and bilge water,
didn't think about relaxing from their former courage,
and, making a pretense of surrender and dragging out the discussion of terms,
early in the night they forced the helmsman to drive the ship onto land,
grabbed a good spot and spent the rest of the night there.
At first light, when they were attacked by about 400 well-armed cavalry,
who'd been sent by Otacilius to guard that part of the sea shore,
who chased them away from their encampment.
They defended themselves and after killing a number of the enemy safely withdrew to
our own lines.
