29.1
Quo facto conventus civium Romanorum, qui Lissum obtinebant,
quod oppidum eis antea Caesar attribuerat muniendumque curaverat,
Antonium recepit omnibusque rebus iuvit.

Otacilius sibi timens ex oppido fugit et ad Pompeium pervenit.

Expositis omnibus copiis Antonius,
quarum erat summa veteranarum trium legionum uniusque tironum et equitum DCCC,
plerasque naves in Italiam remittit ad reliquos milites equitesque
transportandos,
pontones, quod est genus navium Gallicarum, Lissi relinquit, hoc consilio,
ut si forte Pompeius vacuam existimans Italiam eo traiecisset exercitum,
quae opinio erat edita in vulgus,
aliquam Caesar ad insequendum facultatem haberet,
nuntiosque ad eum celeriter mittit,
quibus regionibus exercitum exposuisset et quid militum transvexisset.

After this happened an assembly of the Roman citizens who held Lissus
accepted Antony and aided him in all things,
because Caesar had previously granted the town to them and had seen to its fortifications.
Otacilius, fearing for his own safety, fled the town and went to Pompey.

Antony, after disembarking all of his troops,
totaling three legions of veterans and of one of recruits and 800 horse,
sent most of the ships back to Italy to tranport
the rest of the soldiers and cavalry.
He left his pontoons, a sort of Gallic ship, at Lissus,
by this plan,
so that, if by chance Pompey, supposing Italy to be unoccupied,
had transported his army there,
a belief that was put forth among the general public,
that Caesar should have some means of pursuing him.
He quickly sent messengers to Caesar,
that he might set out his army in those regions
and what of soldiers he might have transported.
