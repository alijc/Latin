30.1
Haec eodem fere tempore Caesar atque Pompeius cognoscunt.

Nam praetervectas Apolloniam Dyrrachiumque naves viderant ipsi,
ut iter secundum eas terras direxerant,
sed quo essent eae delatae, primus diebus ignorabant.

Cognitaque re diversa sibi ambo consilia capiunt:
Caesar, ut quam primum se cum Antonio coniungeret;
Pompeius, ut venientibus in itinere se opponeret,
si imprudentes ex insidiis, adoriri posset,
eodemque die uterque eorum ex castris stativis a flumine Apso exercitum educunt:
Pompeius clam et noctu, Caesar palam atque interdiu.

Sed Caesari circuitu maiore iter erat longius,
adverso flumine, ut vado transire posset;
Pompeius, quia expedito itinere flumen ei transeundum non erat,
magnis itineribus ad Antonium contendit atque eum ubi appropinquare cognovit,
idoneum locum nactus ibi copias collocavit suosque omnes in castris continuit
ignesque fieri prohibuit, quo occultior esset eius adventus.

Haec ad Antonium statim per Graecos deferuntur.

Ille missis ad Caesarem nuntiis unum diem sese castris tenuit;
altero die ad eum pervenit Caesar.

Cuius adventu cognito Pompeius,
ne duobus circumcluderetur exercitibus,
ex eo loco discedit omnibusque copiis ad Asparagium Dyrrachinorum pervenit
atque ibi idoneo loco castra ponit.


Caesar and Pompey learned these things at nearly the same time.

For they themselves had seen the ships as they passed Apollonia and Dyrrachium,
as they had steered the voyage back to land,
but where they might be carried, first in the days they didn't know.

And when the truth of it was known, each man seized on his own distinct plan:
Caesar, to join up with Antony as quickly as possible;
Pompey, to oppose those who were on the way, if he could catch them unawares.
And on the same day both of them led their armies out of their permanent camps
by the Apso River:
Pompey under cover of darkness, and Caesar openly in the daytime.

But Caesar's route was much longer,
as he'd turned towards the river, so that he could ford it;
Pompey, since he was marching with no baggage and had no need to cross the river,
strove towards Antony by forced marches and found out where to approach him.
After securing an advantageous position he assembled his troops and
kept all of his men in camp, forbidding them to make fires, so their arrival
would be kept more secret.

The Greeks at once informed Antony of these things.

He having sent messengers to Caesar for one day held by/to his camp by himself;
on the next day to him Caesar arrived.

Whose arrival having become known, Pompey,
lest to/by two armied he be surrounded,
from the spot withdrew and to/by troops to Asparagium of the Dyrrachians reached
and there pitched camp in a suitable site.
