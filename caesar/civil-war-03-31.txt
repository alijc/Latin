31.1 His temporibus Scipio detrimentis quibusdam circa montem
Amanum acceptis imperatorem se appellaverat.  Quo facto civitatibus
tyrannisque magnas imperaverat pecunias, item a publicanis suae
provinciae debitam biennii pecuniam exegerat et ab eisdem
insequentis anni mutuam praeceperat equitesque toti provinciae
imperaverat.  Quibus coactis, finitimis hostibus Parthis post se
relictis, qui paulo ante M. Crassum imperatorem interfecerant et
M. Bibulum in obsidione habuerant, legiones equitesque ex Syria
deduxerat.  Summamque in sollicitudinem ac timorem Parthici belli
provincia cum venisset, ac nonnullae militum voces cum audirentur,
sese, contra hostem si ducerentur, ituros, contra civem et consulem
arma non laturos, deductis Pergamum atque in locupletissimas urbes
in hiberna legionibus maximas largitiones fecit et confirmandorum
militum causa diripiendas his civitates dedit.


While this was going on, Scipio, having suffered some losses around
Mount Aranum, had declared himself commander-in-chief.  After doing
this he'd levied great sums of money from the cities and tyrants.
He'd also exacted two years' of tax from the tax farmers of his own
province and had borrowed against the next year's tax in advance
and had levied knights from the whole province.  When these had
been assembled, he left the nearby Parthian enemy unmolested, who a
little before had killed commander-in-chief M. Crassus and besieged
M. Bibulus, and had led his legions and calvary out of Syria.  And
when he arrived the province was in the utmost anxiety and fear of
a Parthian war, and after some soldiers' voices were heard to say
that they would march, if led against the enemy, but would not bear
arms against a citizen or consul, he gave his legions rich gifts,
quartering them in Pergamum and some rich cities, and in order to
instill courage in his soldiers he granted them leave to plunder
those cities.
