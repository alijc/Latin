32.1
Interim acerbissime imperatae pecuniae tota provincia exigebantur.
Multa praeterea generatim ad avaritiam excogitabantur.

In capita singula servorum ac liberorum tributum imponebatur;
columnaria, ostiaria, frumentum, milites, arma, remiges, tormenta, vecturae
imperabantur;
cuius modo rei nomen reperiri poterat,
hoc satis esse ad cogendas pecunias videbatur.

Non solum urbibus,
sed paene vicis castellisque singulis cum imperio praeficiebantur.

Qui horum quid acerbissime crudelissimeque fecerat,
is et vir et civis optimus habebatur.

Erat plena lictorum et imperiorum provincia,
differta praefectis atque exactoribus:
qui praeter imperatas pecunias suo etiam privato compendio serviebant;
dictitabant enim se domo patriaque expulsos omnibus necessariis egere rebus,
ut honesta praescriptione rem turpissimam tegerent.

Accedebant ad haec gravissimae usurae,
quod in bello plerumque accidere consuevit universis imperatis pecuniis;
quibus in rebus prolationem diei donationem esse dicebant.

Itaque aes alienum provinciae eo biennio multiplicatum est.

Neque minus ob eam causam civibus Romanis eius provinciae,
sed in singulos conventus singulasque civitates certae pecuniae imperabantur,
mutuasque illas ex senatusconsulto exigi dictitabant;
publicanis, ut in Syria fecerant, insequentis anni vectigal promutuum.


Meanwhile, the levied money was very harshly squeezed out of the whole province.

Much else was generally being contrived according to avarice.

A tax was imposed upon each and every slave and freedman;
taxes were levied on pillars, doors, crops, soldiers, weapons, oars, windlasses,
carts;
without rhyme or reason,
it seemed that this was enough for gathering money.

Not just the cities,
but nearly every village and town were put in charge by command.

Whoever among them had acted with the most bitterness and cruelty,
was held to be both the best man and the best citizen.

It was a province filled of lictors and authorities,
stuffed with prefects and tax collectors:
who were serving their personal gain as well as levying money;
for they would persist in saying that they, driven out from home and fatherland,
lacked everything needful,
to hide their ugly business under a reputable cover.

They added of heaviest interest to these,
as tends to happen to all levied money in times of war;
in such cases they would call the postponement of a day a gift.

And so during that biennium foreign coinage multiplied in the province.

And no less on account of the reason to/by Roman citizens of their province,
but a fixed sum was levied against each town, together and separately,
and they insisted that those borrowed funds were squeezed out by a decree of the
senate;
as they had done in Syria, they advanced the next year's tax revenue
from the tax-farmers.
