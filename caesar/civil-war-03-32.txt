32.1 Interim acerbissime imperatae pecuniae tota provincia
exigebantur.  Multa praeterea generatim ad avaritiam
excogitabantur.  In capita singula servorum ac liberorum tributum
imponebatur; columnaria, ostiaria, frumentum, milites, arma,
remiges, tormenta, vecturae imperabantur; cuius modo rei nomen
reperiri poterat, hoc satis esse ad cogendas pecunias videbatur.
Non solum urbibus, sed paene vicis castellisque singulis cum
imperio praeficiebantur.  Qui horum quid acerbissime
crudelissimeque fecerat, is et vir et civis optimus habebatur.
Erat plena lictorum et imperiorum provincia, differta praefectis
atque exactoribus: qui praeter imperatas pecunias suo etiam
privato compendio serviebant; dictitabant enim se domo patriaque
expulsos omnibus necessariis egere rebus, ut honesta
praescriptione rem turpissimam tegerent.  Accedebant ad haec
gravissimae usurae, quod in bello plerumque accidere consuevit
universis imperatis pecuniis; quibus in rebus prolationem diei
donationem esse dicebant.  Itaque aes alienum provinciae eo
biennio multiplicatum est.  Neque minus ob eam causam civibus
Romanis eius provinciae, sed in singulos conventus singulasque
civitates certae pecuniae imperabantur, mutuasque illas ex
senatusconsulto exigi dictitabant; publicanis, ut in Syria
fecerant, insequentis anni vectigal promutuum.


Meanwhile, the requisitioned funds were draconianly extracted from
the whole province.  Many other sorts of things were contrived to
satisfy their avarice.  A poll tax was imposed upon each slave and
freeman; taxes were levied on pillars, doors, crops, soldiers,
weapons, oars, windlasses, carts; if they could come up with a
name for a thing, it seemed that that was good enough to gather
money for it.  They were charged with command of not just the
cities, but nearly every village and fortress.  Whoever among them
had acted with the most bitterness and cruelty was held to be both
the best man and the best citizen.  It was a province filled with
lictors and authorities, stuffed with prefects and tax collectors
- who were serving their personal gain as well as collecting taxes
- for they would hide their ugly business under a reputable cover
by persisting in saying that they, driven out from home and
fatherland, lacked every necessity.  Usurious interest added to
these matters, as always tends to happen with requisitioned money
in times of war; in such cases they would call the postponement of
a day a gift.  And so during that biennium foreign coinage
multiplied in the province.  And from this no less for the Roman
citizens of the province, but a fixed sum was also levied against
each town, together and separately, and they insisted that those
borrowed funds were extracted by a decree of the senate; as they
had done in Syria, they advanced the next year's tax revenue from
the tax-farmers.
