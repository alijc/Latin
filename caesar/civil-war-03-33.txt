33.1
Praeterea Ephesi a fano Dianae depositas antiquitus pecunias Scipio tolli
iubebat.
Certaque eius rei die constituta cum in fanum ventum esset adhibitis compluribus
ordinis senatorii, quos advocaverat Scipio, litterae ei redduntur a Pompeio,
mare transisse cum legionibus Caesarem:
properaret ad se cum exercitu venire omniaque posthaberet.
His litteris acceptis quos advocaverat dimittit;
ipse iter in Macedoniam parare incipit paucisque post diebus est profectus.

Haec res Ephesiae pecuniae salutem attulit.


After that, Scipio commanded his men to steal the money that had been
deposited, ages ago, in the temple of Diana in Ephesus.
And on the day fixed for this deed, after Scipio had entered the temple,
with many of senatorial rank that he had summoned,
letters from Pompey were delivered to him,
telling him that Caesar had crossed the sea with his legions:
and ordering him to speedily come to him with his army,
subordinating everything else to this.
After receiving these letters, he dismissed those whom he had summoned;
he set to preparing for the march to Macedonia and set out a few days later.
This brought the matter of the money of Ephesus to safety.
