34.1
Caesar Antonii exercitu coniuncto deducta Orico legione,
quam tuendae orae maritimae causa posuerat,
temptandas sibi provincias longiusque procedendum existimabat et,
cum ad eum ex Thessalia Aetoliaque legati venissent,
qui praesidio misso pollicerentur earum gentium civitates imperata facturas,
L. Cassium Longinum cum legione tironum, quae appellabatur XXVII,
atque equitibus CC in Thessaliam,
C. Calvisium Sabinum cum cohortibus V paucisque equitibus in Aetoliam misit;
maxime eos, quod erant propinquae regiones,
de re frumentaria ut providerent, hortatus est.
Cn. Domitium Calvinum cum legionibus duabus, XI et XII,
et equitibus D in Macedoniam proficisci iussit;
cuius provinciae ab ea parte, quae libera appellabatur,
Menedemus, princeps earum regionum,
missus legatus omnium suorum excellens studium profitebatur.


After Caesar joined up with Antony's army and withdrew the legion from Oricos
(that he'd posted there to defend the sea shore),
he was thinking that he should march out further and attack the provinces.
And after he met with the legates from Thessaly and Aetolia,
who had sent aid and been promised citizenship for their people for doing so,
he sent L. Cassius Longinus with a legion of fresh recruits, called the 27th,
and 200 horse into Thessaly,
and C. Calvisius Sabinus with 5 cohorts and a few horse into Aetolia;
he was encouraged that these might provide in the business of resupply,
chiefly because they were nearby regions.
He ordered Cn. Domitius Calvinus to proceed with two legions, the 9th and 11th,
and with 500 horse into Macedonia;
Menedemus, the chieftain of the region,
whose provinces were from the part called free,
had been sent as a legate for all his possessions
and was professing his preeminent zeal.
