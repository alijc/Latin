Caesar Antonii exercitu coniuncto deducta Orico legione,
quam tuendae orae maritimae causa posuerat,
temptandas sibi provincias longiusque procedendum existimabat et,
cum ad eum ex Thessalia Aetoliaque legati venissent,
qui praesidio misso pollicerentur earum gentium civitates imperata facturas,
L. Cassium Longinum cum legione tironum, quae appellabatur XXVII,
atque equitibus CC in Thessaliam,
C. Calvisium Sabinum cum cohortibus V paucisque equitibus in Aetoliam misit;
maxime eos, quod erant propinquae regiones,
de re frumentaria ut providerent, hortatus est.

Cn. Domitium Calvinum cum legionibus duabus, XI et XII,
et equitibus D in Macedoniam proficisci iussit;
cuius provinciae ab ea parte, quae libera appellabatur,
Menedemus, princeps earum regionum,
missus legatus omnium suorum excellens studium profitebatur.
