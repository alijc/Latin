34.1 Caesar Antonii exercitu coniuncto deducta Orico legione,
quam tuendae orae maritimae causa posuerat, temptandas sibi
provincias longiusque procedendum existimabat et, cum ad eum ex
Thessalia Aetoliaque legati venissent, qui praesidio misso
pollicerentur earum gentium civitates imperata facturas,
L. Cassium Longinum cum legione tironum, quae appellabatur XXVII,
atque equitibus CC in Thessaliam, C. Calvisium Sabinum cum
cohortibus V paucisque equitibus in Aetoliam misit; maxime eos,
quod erant propinquae regiones, de re frumentaria ut providerent,
hortatus est.  Cn. Domitium Calvinum cum legionibus duabus, XI et
XII, et equitibus D in Macedoniam proficisci iussit; cuius
provinciae ab ea parte, quae libera appellabatur, Menedemus,
princeps earum regionum, missus legatus omnium suorum excellens
studium profitebatur.


After Caesar joined up with Antony's army and recalled the legion
that he'd posted  at Oricum to defend the seashore, he
judged that he should advance and probe the more distant provinces.
And after he met with the ambassadors from Thessaly
and Aetolia, who promised, if aid was sent, that the towns of
their nations would obey orders, he sent L. Cassius Longinus with
a legion of fresh recruits, called the 27th, and 200 horse into
Thessaly, and C. Calvisius Sabinus with 5 cohorts and a few horse
into Aetolia; he especially urged them to provide in the business
of resupply, because the regions were close at hand.  He ordered
Cn. Domitius Calvinus to proceed with two legions, the 9th and
11th, and with 500 horse into Macedonia; Menedemus, the chieftain
of the region, whose provinces were from the part called free,
had been sent as an ambassador for all his possessions and was
professing his preeminent zeal.
