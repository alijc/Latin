35.1

Ex his Calvisius primo adventu summa omnium Aetolorum receptus voluntate,
praesidiis adversariorum Calydone et Naupacto eiectis,
omni Aetolia potitus est.

Cassius in Thessaliam cum legione pervenit.

Hic cum essent factiones duae, varia voluntate civitatum utebatur:
Hegesaretos, veteris homo potentiae, Pompeianis rebus studebat;
Petraeus, summae nobilitatis adulescens,
suis ac suorum opibus Caesarem enixe iuvabat.


Of these two, Calvisius, after receiving the greatest good will of all the
Aetolians when he first arrived,
after expelling the enemy garrisons from Calydonum and Naupactum,
became master of all of Aetolia.

Cassius arrived in Thessaly with a legion.

Since there were two factions, he made use of the wavering wills of the cities:
Hegesaretos, a man of long-established power, was eager for the Pompeian cause;
Petraeus, a youth of the highest nobility,
was aiding Caesar with his own resources and those of his men.
