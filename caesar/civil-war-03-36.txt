36.1 Eodemque tempore Domitius in Macedoniam venit; et cum ad eum
frequentes civitatum legationes convenire coepissent, nuntiatum est
adesse Scipionem cum legionibus, magna opinione et fama omnium; nam
plerumque in novitate rem fama antecedit.  Hic nullo in loco
Macedoniae moratus magno impetu tetendit ad Domitium et, cum ab eo
milia passuum XX afuisset, subito se ad Cassium Longinum in
Thessaliam convertit.  Hoc adeo celeriter fecit, ut simul adesse et
venire nuntiaretur, et quo iter expeditius faceret, M. Favonium ad
flumen Aliacmonem, quod Macedoniam a Thessalia dividit, cum
cohortibus VIII praesidio impedimentis legionum reliquit
castellumque ibi muniri iussit.  Eodem tempore equitatus regis
Cotyis ad castra Cassii advolavit, qui circum Thessaliam esse
consuerat.  Tum timore perterritus Cassius cognito Scipionis
adventu visisque equitibus, quos Scipionis esse arbitrabatur, ad
montes se convertit, qui Thessaliam cingunt, atque ex his locis
Ambraciam versus iter facere coepit.  At Scipionem properantem
sequi litterae sunt consecutae a M. Favonio, Domitium cum
legionibus adesse neque se praesidium, ubi constitutus esset, sine
auxilio Scipionis tenere posse.  Quibus litteris acceptis consilium
Scipio iterque commutat; Cassium sequi desistit, Favonio auxilium
ferre contendit.  Itaque die ac nocte continuato itinere ad eum
pervenit, tam opportuno tempore, ut simul Domitiani exercitus
pulvis cerneretur, et primi antecursores Scipionis viderentur.  Ita
Cassio industria Domitii, Favonio Scipionis celeritas salutem
attulit.


Meanwhile, Domitius arrived in Macedonia; and after numerous
embassies of the cities had arrived to meet with him, it was
reported that Scipio and his legions were approaching, according to
the great opinion and rumor of everyone; for in the news rumor
usually outstrips reality.  This man hadn't been delayed by a major
assault anywhere in Macedonia and pressed on towards Domitius and
then, when he was 20 miles away, suddenly turned aside to Cassius
Longinus in Thessaly.  He did this so quickly, that he was reported
both to be near and to have arrived at the same time.  He left
M. Favonius at the river Aliacmona, which divides Macedonia from
Thessaly, with 8 cohorts to protect the legions' baggage, so that
he could march unencumbered, and ordered the fortress there to be
strengthened.  At the same time King Cotyis' cavalry, which had
grown accustome to be around Thessaly, dashed to the camp of
Cassius.  Then when Cassius, who had been told of Scipio's arrival,
saw horsemen that he assumed were Scipio's, he withdrew in terror
to the mountains that ring Thessaly, and from there he began to
bend his path to Ambracia.  Scipio rushed in pursuit, until letters
from M. Favonius reached him, telling him that Domitius and his
legions had approached and that he wouldn't be able to hold his
position without Scipio's aid.  After receiving these letters
Scipio altered his plan and his route; he desisted in the pursuit
of Cassius, and rushed to bear aid to Favonius.  And so, in a
forced day and night march, he reached him at such an opportune
time, that the dust from Domitius' army was spied at the same time.
Thus Domitius' diligence brought safety for Cassius, as Scipio's
speed did for Favonius.
