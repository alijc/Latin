36.1
Eodemque tempore Domitius in Macedoniam venit;
et cum ad eum frequentes civitatum legationes convenire coepissent,
nuntiatum est adesse Scipionem cum legionibus,
magna opinione et fama omnium; nam plerumque in novitate rem fama antecedit.
Hic nullo in loco Macedoniae moratus magno impetu tetendit ad Domitium et,
cum ab eo milia passuum XX afuisset,
subito se ad Cassium Longinum in Thessaliam convertit.
Hoc adeo celeriter fecit,
ut simul adesse et venire nuntiaretur,
et quo iter expeditius faceret, M. Favonium ad flumen Aliacmonem,
quod Macedoniam a Thessalia dividit,
cum cohortibus VIII praesidio impedimentis legionum reliquit
castellumque ibi muniri iussit.
Eodem tempore equitatus regis Cotyis ad castra Cassii advolavit,
qui circum Thessaliam esse consuerat.
Tum timore perterritus Cassius cognito Scipionis adventu visisque equitibus,
quos Scipionis esse arbitrabatur, ad montes se convertit,
qui Thessaliam cingunt, atque ex his locis Ambraciam versus iter facere coepit.
At Scipionem properantem sequi litterae sunt consecutae a M. Favonio,
Domitium cum legionibus adesse neque se praesidium,
ubi constitutus esset, sine auxilio Scipionis tenere posse.
Quibus litteris acceptis consilium Scipio iterque commutat;
Cassium sequi desistit, Favonio auxilium ferre contendit.
Itaque die ac nocte continuato itinere ad eum pervenit,
tam opportuno tempore,
ut simul Domitiani exercitus pulvis cerneretur,
et primi antecursores Scipionis viderentur.

Ita Cassio industria Domitii, Favonio Scipionis celeritas salutem attulit.


At the same time Domitius arrived in Macedonia;
and after numerous embassies of the cities had arrived to meet with him,
it was reported that Scipio was nearby with his legions,
by the great opinion and rumor of all;
for in the news rumor usually outstrips reality.
This man hadn't been delayed by a major assault anywhere in Macedonia
and pressed on towards Domitius and then, when he was 20 miles away,
suddenly turned aside to Cassius Longinus in Thessaly.
He did this so quickly,
that he was reported both to be near and to have arrived at the same time.
He left M. Favonius at the river Aliacmona,
which divides Macedonia from Thessaly,
with 8 cohorts protect the legions' baggage,
so that he march unencumbered,
and ordered the fortress there to be fortified.
At the same time King Cotyis' cavalry dashed to the camp of Cassius,
who had been accustomed to be around Thessaly.
Then when Cassius was made aware of Scipio's arrival and when he saw 
horsemen that he thought were Scipio's, he withdrew in terror to the mountains
that ring Thessaly, and from there he began to bend his path to Ambracia.
But letters from M. Favonius reached Scipio, rushing in pursuit,
telling him that Domitius was nearby with his legions
and that he himslef would not be able to hold his position without Scipio's aid.
After receiving these letters Scipio altered his plan and his route;
he desisted in the pursuit of Cassius, and rushed to bear aid to Favonius.
And so, in a forced march, all day and night he reached him,
at such an advantageous time,
that the dust of Domitius' army was spied at the same time.
Thus Domitius' diligence brought safety for Cassius,
as Scipio's speed did for Favonius.
