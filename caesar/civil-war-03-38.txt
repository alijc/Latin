38.1 His rebus gestis Domitius, sperans Scipionem ad pugnam elici
posse, simulavit sese angustiis rei frumentariae adductum castra
movere, vasisque militari more conclamatis progressus milia
passuum III loco idoneo et occulto omnem exercitum equitatumque
collocavit.  Scipio ad sequendum paratus equitus magnam partem ad
explorandum iter Domitii et cognoscendum praemisit.  Qui cum
essent progressi, primaeque turmae insidias intravissent, ex
fremitu equorum illata suspicione ad suos se recipere coeperunt,
quique hos sequebantur celerem eorum receptum conspicati
restiterunt.  Nostri, cognitis insidiis, ne frustra reliquos
exspectarent, duas nacti turmas exceperunt (in his fuit
M. Opimius, praefectus equitum), reliquos omnes aut interfecerunt
aut captos ad Domitium deduxerunt.


After these events, Domitius, hoping to draw Scipio out to battle,
pretended that he had to shift his camp, due to difficulties with
his supply line, after the signal was given in the military custom
he advanced 3 miles and assembled his entire army and calvary in a
site that was suitable and concealed.  Scipio, prepared to pursue
him, sent a large part of his horse ahead to reconnoiter and
discover Domitius' route.  And after he had advanced, and his
foremost troops had reached the ambush, they grew suspicious,
after hearing horses neighing, and began to withdraw, and the men
who were following them observed their swift retreat and stopped
advancing.  When the ambush had been discovered, our men, to keep
from waiting for the rest of the men in vain, lighted on and took
two squadrons.  (M. Opimius, commander of the horse, was among
these.)  They either killed all the rest or led them captive to
Domitius.
