38.1
His rebus gestis Domitius, sperans Scipionem ad pugnam elici posse,
simulavit sese angustiis rei frumentariae adductum castra movere,
vasisque militari more conclamatis progressus milia passuum III loco idoneo
et occulto omnem exercitum equitatumque collocavit.

Scipio ad sequendum paratus equitus magnam partem ad explorandum iter Domitii et
 cognoscendum praemisit.

Qui cum essent progressi, primaeque turmae insidias intravissent,
ex fremitu equorum illata suspicione ad suos se recipere coeperunt,
quique hos sequebantur celerem eorum receptum conspicati restiterunt.

Nostri, cognitis insidiis, ne frustra reliquos exspectarent,
duas nacti turmas exceperunt (in his fuit M. Opimius, praefectus equitum),
reliquos omnes aut interfecerunt aut captos ad Domitium deduxerunt.


After these events, Domitius, hoping that he could entice Scipio out to battle,
pretended that he was constrained to shift his camp, due to difficulties with
his his supply line,
and to/by military custom their equipment having been signaled an advance of 3
miles to a suitable site
and in secret >whole army and calvary he assembled.

Scipio to the following prepared of horse >a great part to reconnoitering the
path of Domitius and sent ahead for finding out.

And when he had advanced, and the first troops had reached the ambush,
out of a roar of horses a suspicion having been carried in to his men they began
to withdraw,
anyone >these they were following
>their swift retreat those observed stood firm.

Our men, having learned of the ambush, lest in vain >remaining men they might
await,
having obtained two squadrons they followed/relieved
(in these was M. Opimius, commander of the horse),
>all the rest either they killed or led captured to Domitius.
