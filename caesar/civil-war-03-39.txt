39.1 Deductis orae maritimae praesidiis Caesar, ut supra demonstratum
est, III cohortes Orici oppidi tuendi causa reliquit isdemque
custodiam navium longarum tradidit, quas ex Italia traduxerat.  Huic
officio oppidoque Acilius Caninus legatus praeerat.  Is naves nostras
interiorem in portum post oppidum reduxit et ad terram deligavit
faucibusque portus navem onerariam submersam obiecit et huic alteram
coniunxit; super quam turrim effectam ad ipsum introitum portus
opposuit et militibus complevit tuendamque ad omnes repentinos casus
tradidit.


After leading a detachment down to the seashore, Caesar, as has been
mentioned above, left 3 cohorts for the protection of the town of
Oricum and handed over the custody of the galleys, that he'd brought
across from Italy, to these same men.  The legate Acilius Caninus was
in charge of this duty and of the town.  He shifted our ships back
into the inner port behind the town and tied them up there.  He
scuttled a galley in the narrow entrance of the port and attached a
second one to it.  Above this he raised a tower at the very entrance
of the port and filled it with soldiers and handed it over for
protection against all unexpected eventualities.
