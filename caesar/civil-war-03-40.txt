40.1 Quibus cognitis rebus Cn. Pompeius filius, qui classi
Aegyptiae praeerat, ad Oricum venit submersamque navim remulco
multisque contendens funibus adduxit atque alteram navem, quae
erat ad custodiam ab Acilio posita, pluribus aggressus navibus, in
quibus ad libram fecerat turres, ut ex superiore pugnans loco
integrosque semper defatigatis submittens et reliquis partibus
simul ex terra scalis et classe moenia oppidi temptans, uti
adversariorum manus diduceret, labore et multitudine telorum
nostros vicit, deiectisque defensoribus, qui omnes scaphis excepti
refugerant, eam navem expugnavit, eodemque tempore ex altera parte
molem tenuit naturalem obiectam, quae paene insulam oppidum
effecerat, et IIII biremes subiectis scutulis impulsas vectibus in
interiorem portum traduxit.


When Cn. Pompey Jr, commanding the Egyptian fleet, learned of this
he came to Oricos and dragged off the scuttled ship, pulling it
with a tow-rope and with many lines.  He also attacked the other
ship, the one that Acilius had placed to defend the harbor, with
many ships that he'd built equally tall towers on, that let him
fight from a higher position.  At the same time he assailed the
walls of the town from the remaining sides, with ladders from land
and with the fleet, continually relieving his exhausted troops
with fresh ones so that a band of the enemy could split off.  With
effort and a mass of javelins he defeated our men, who fled in the
ship's boats, and captured the ship.  Meanwhile on another side he
held a natural exposed mole, which had nearly made the town an
island, and he brought over 4 biremes with small shields placed
under them, and levered into the inner harbor.
