40.1 Quibus cognitis rebus Cn. Pompeius filius, qui classi
Aegyptiae praeerat, ad Oricum venit submersamque navim remulco
multisque contendens funibus adduxit atque alteram navem, quae
erat ad custodiam ab Acilio posita, pluribus aggressus navibus, in
quibus ad libram fecerat turres, ut ex superiore pugnans loco
integrosque semper defatigatis submittens et reliquis partibus
simul ex terra scalis et classe moenia oppidi temptans, uti
adversariorum manus diduceret, labore et multitudine telorum
nostros vicit, deiectisque defensoribus, qui omnes scaphis excepti
refugerant, eam navem expugnavit, eodemque tempore ex altera parte
molem tenuit naturalem obiectam, quae paene insulam oppidum
effecerat, et IIII biremes subiectis scutulis impulsas vectibus in
interiorem portum traduxit.


When Cn. Pompey Jr, commanding the Egyptian fleet, learned of this
he came to Oricos and dragged off the scuttled ship, pulling it
with a tow-rope and with many lines.  He also attacked the other
ship, the one that Acilius had placed to defend the harbor, with
many ships that he'd built equally tall towers on, that let him
fight from a higher position.  At the same time he assailed the
walls of the town from the remaining sides, with ladders from land
and with the fleet, continually relieving his exhausted troops
with fresh ones in order to split up the enemy.  With
effort and a mass of javelins he defeated our men, who fled in the
ship's boats, and captured the ship.  Meanwhile on another side he
held a natural exposed mole, which had nearly made the town an
island, and he brought over 4 biremes with rollerd placed
under them, and levered them into the inner harbor.


40.2
Ita ex utraque parte naves longas aggressus,
quae erant deligatae ad terram atque inanes,
IIII ex his abduxit, reliquas incendit.

Hoc confecto negotio D. Laelium ab Asiatica classe abductum reliquit,
qui commeatus Bullide atque Amantia importari in oppidum prohibebat.

Ipse Lissum profectus naves onerarias XXX a M. Antonio relictas intra portum aggressus omnes incendit;

Lissum expugnare conatus defendentibus civibus Romanis,
qui eius conventus erant, militibusque,
quos praesidii causa miserat Caesar,
triduum moratus paucis in oppugnatione amissis re infecta inde discessit.


And so from all sides he attacked the galleys, tied up to land and empty.
He carried off 4 of these, and burned the rest.
After accomplishing this, he left D. Laelius there.
He had been detached from the Asiatic fleet
and was preventing Bullida and Amantia from transporting supplies into town.

He himself left Lissum and attacked the 30 galleys that remained in the harbor
by M. Antonius, burning all of them;
having attempted to storm Lissum, repelled by Roman citizens,
who his had been assembled, and with soldiers,
>whom for the sake of protection Caesar had sent,
for three days delayed by a few lost in an assault
without having accomplished it from there/then he withdrew.
