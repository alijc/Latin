40.1
Quibus cognitis rebus Cn. Pompeius filius,
qui classi Aegyptiae praeerat,
ad Oricum venit submersamque navim remulco multisque contendens funibus adduxit
atque alteram navem,
quae erat ad custodiam ab Acilio posita, pluribus aggressus navibus,
in quibus ad libram fecerat turres,
ut ex superiore pugnans loco integrosque semper defatigatis submittens
et reliquis partibus simul ex terra scalis et classe moenia oppidi temptans,
uti adversariorum manus diduceret,
labore et multitudine telorum nostros vicit,
deiectisque defensoribus,
qui omnes scaphis excepti refugerant,
eam navem expugnavit,
eodemque tempore ex altera parte molem tenuit naturalem obiectam,
quae paene insulam oppidum effecerat,
et IIII biremes subiectis scutulis impulsas vectibus in interiorem portum traduxit.


After learning of this, Cn. Pompey Jr, who was in command of the Egyptian fleet,
came to Oricum/s and
dragging at the scuttled ship with a tow-rope and with many lines
he brought in another ship,
which had been stationed at the garrison by Acilius, assaulted by many ships,
in which to scales/balance he had built towers,
so that out of higher ground fighting and >fresh troops always to/by worn out
relieving
and to/by the remaining part likewise from land by ladders and the fleet
attempting the walls of the town,
so that of the enemy his hand/band might draw aside,
and the defenders having been overthrown,
who all having taken out with skiffs fled,
stormed the ship,
at the same time out of the other part/side he held the wall/mole? 
natural having been thrown,
which had nearly made the town an island ,
and 4 biremes having thrown under shields >driven (ships) by levers into the
inner harbor he brought over.
