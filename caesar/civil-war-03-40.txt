40.1 Quibus cognitis rebus Cn. Pompeius filius, qui classi
Aegyptiae praeerat, ad Oricum venit submersamque navim remulco
multisque contendens funibus adduxit atque alteram navem, quae
erat ad custodiam ab Acilio posita, pluribus aggressus navibus, in
quibus ad libram fecerat turres, ut ex superiore pugnans loco
integrosque semper defatigatis submittens et reliquis partibus
simul ex terra scalis et classe moenia oppidi temptans, uti
adversariorum manus diduceret, labore et multitudine telorum
nostros vicit, deiectisque defensoribus, qui omnes scaphis excepti
refugerant, eam navem expugnavit, eodemque tempore ex altera parte
molem tenuit naturalem obiectam, quae paene insulam oppidum
effecerat, et IIII biremes subiectis scutulis impulsas vectibus in
interiorem portum traduxit. Ita ex utraque parte naves longas
aggressus, quae erant deligatae ad terram atque inanes, IIII ex
his abduxit, reliquas incendit.  Hoc confecto negotio D. Laelium
ab Asiatica classe abductum reliquit, qui commeatus Bullide atque
Amantia importari in oppidum prohibebat.  Ipse Lissum profectus
naves onerarias XXX a M. Antonio relictas intra portum aggressus
omnes incendit; Lissum expugnare conatus defendentibus civibus
Romanis, qui eius conventus erant, militibusque, quos praesidii
causa miserat Caesar, triduum moratus paucis in oppugnatione
amissis re infecta inde discessit.



When Cn. Pompey Jr, commanding the Egyptian fleet, learned of this
he came to Oricos and dragged off the scuttled ship, pulling it
with a tow-rope and with many lines.  He also attacked the other
ship, the one that Acilius had placed to defend the harbor, with
many ships that he'd built equally tall towers on, that let him
fight from a higher position.  At the same time he assailed the
walls of the town from the remaining sides, with ladders from land
and with the fleet, continually relieving his exhausted troops
with fresh ones in order to split up the enemy.  With
effort and a mass of javelins he defeated our men, who fled in the
ship's boats, and captured the ship.  Meanwhile on another side he
held a natural exposed mole, which had nearly made the town an
island, and he brought over 4 biremes with rollerd placed
under them, and levered them into the inner harbor.


And so he attacked the galleys, tied up to land and empty, from
all sides.  He carried off 4 of these, and burned the rest.  After
accomplishing this, he detached D. Laelius from the Asiatic fleet
and left him there, to keep supplies from being imported to the
town from Byllis and Amantia.  He himself left for Lissus and
attacked the 30 galleys that M. Antonius had left in the harbor,
burning all of them.  He attempted to take Lissus itself, but was
repelled by the Roman citizens who had gathered there, and by the
soldiers that Caesar had send to defend the town.  He withdrew
from there after a delay of three days, with a few losses and no
success.
