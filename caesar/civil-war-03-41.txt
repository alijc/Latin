41.1
Caesar, postquam Pompeium ad Asparagium esse cognovit,
eodem cum exercitu profectus expugnato in itinere oppido Parthinorum,
in quo Pompeius praesidium habebat,
tertio die ad Pompeium pervenit iuxtaque eum castra posuit
et postridie eductis omnibus copiis acie instructa decernendi potestatem Pompeio fecit.
Ubi illum suis locis se tenere animadvertit,
reducto in castra exercitu aliud sibi consilium capiendum existimavit.
Itaque postero die omnibus copiis magno circuitu difficili angustoque itinere
Dyrrachium profectus est sperans Pompeium aut Dyrrachium compelli aut ab eo
intercludi posse, quod omnem commeatum totiusque belli apparatum eo contulisset;
ut accidit Pompeius enim primo ignorans eius consilium,
quod diverso ab ea regione itinere profectum videbat,
angustiis rei frumentariae compulsum discessisse existimabat;
postea per exploratores certior factus postero die castra movit,
breviore itinere se occurrere ei posse sperans.

Quod fore suspicatus Caesar militesque adhortatus,
ut aequo animo laborem ferrent,
parvam partem noctis itinere intermisso mane Dyrrachium venit,
cum primum agmen Pompei procul cerneretur,
atque ibi castra posuit.


Caesar, after learning that Pompey was at Asparagium,
set out with his army to the same place,
stopping on the way to attack the town of Parthini?, where Pompey had a garrison.
On the third day he reached Pompey and pitched camp nearby,
and on the next day he led out all his forces and drew them up
  for deciding the power to/by Pompey he made.
When he saw that he held that/it with his own positions,
he brought the army back to camp and formed a plan for capturing the other man.
And so on the next day, taking all his forces in a wide circle on a rough and
difficult road, he reached Dyrrachium,
hoping that he could either drive Pompey out of Dyrrachium or blockade him
because he'd brought all the supplies prepared for the entire war to that place.
And so it happened, for Pompey, not knowing his plan at first,
was seeing progress, because Caesar's route was heading out of the area.
while he had been thinking that he'd have to withdraw, due to his meager supplies.
Then the next day, after his scouts had verified this, he shifted camp,
hoping that he could attack Caesar using a shorter route.

that/because to be going to be having mistrusted Caesar and soldiers having
urged,
so that with a calm mind they might bear the toil,
>a small part of the night the road having been interrupted early in the morning
he came to Dyrrachium,
when Pompey's marching column was at first seen in the distance,
and there he pitched camp.
