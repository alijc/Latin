42.1
Pompeius interclusus Dyrrachio,
ubi propositum tenere non potuit,
secundo usus consilio edito loco,
qui appellatur Petra aditumque habet navibus mediocrem
atque eas a quibusdam protegit ventis, castra communit.
Eo partem navium longarum convenire,
frumentum commeatumque ab Asia atque omnibus regionibus,
quas tenebat, comportari imperat.
Caesar longius bellum ductum iri existimans et de Italicis commeatibus desperans,
quod tanta diligentia omni litora a Pompeianis tenebantur,
classesque ipsius, quas hieme in Sicilia, Gallia, Italia fecerat, morabantur,
in Epirum rei frumentariae causa Q. Tillium et L. Canuleium legatum misit,
quodque hae regiones aberant longius,
locis certis horrea constituit vecturasque frumenti finitimis civitatibus descripsit.
Item Lisso Parthinisque et omnibus castellis quod esset frumenti conquiri iussit.

Id erat perexiguum cum ipsius agri natura,
quod sunt loca aspera ac montuosa ac plerumque frumento utuntur importato,
tum quod Pompeius haec providerat et superioribus diebus praedae loco Parthinos
habuerat
frumentumque omne conquisitum spoliatis effossisque eorum domibus per equites
comportarat.


Pompey, cut off from Dyrrachium when he couldn't hold his position,
made use of a new plan and built a fortified camp in an elevated spot,
which is called the Rock and has tolerable access for ships
and protects them from some winds.
He ordered a portion of the galleys to assemble there,
and the provisions from Asia and all the regions that he held
to be transported there.
Caesar, thinking that the war would be prolonged and dispairing of supplies from
Italy, because the whole coast was held with such diligence by Pompey's men,
and his fleets, which had been built in Sicily, Gaul, and Italy over the winter,
were delayed,
sent the legates Q. Tillius and L Canuleius to Epirum/s with a view to the
grain supply, which these regions lacked longer.
He erected storehouses in some places and
established transportation for grain from the nearby towns.
Likewise, he ordered what might be of grain to be hunted up from Lissus/m and
Parthini and all the redoubts. 

It was very small with the nature of his fields,
that/because there were generally rough and mountainous places for crops that
used having been brought in,
then that/because Pompey foresaw these things and had had Parthinians
mostly recently of spoils in the place
and grain costly to all to/by having been robbed/plundered and gouged out their
by/to houses through cavalry he had brought in.
