44.1 Pompeius neque a mari Dyrrachioque discedere volebat, quod
omnem apparatum belli, tela, arma, tormenta ibi collocaverat
frumentumque exercitui navibus supportabat, neque munitiones
Caesaris prohibere poterat, nisi proelio decertare vellet; quod
eo tempore statuerat non esse faciendum.  Relinquebatur, ut
extremam rationem belli sequens quam plurimos colles occuparet et
quam latissimas regiones praesidiis teneret Caesarisque copias,
quam maxime posset, distineret; idque accidit.  Castellis enim
XXIIII effectis XV milia passuum circuitu amplexus hoc spatio
pabulabatur; multaque erant intra eum locum manu sata, quibus
interim iumenta pasceret.  Atque ut nostri perpetua munitione
providebant, ne quo loco erumperent Pompeiani ac nostros post
tergum adorirentur, ita illi interiore spatio perpetuas
munitiones efficiebant, ne quem locum nostri intrare atque ipsos
a tergo circumvenire possent.  Sed illi operibus vincebant, quod
et numero militum praestabant et interiore spatio minorem
circuitum habebant.  Quaecumque erant loca Caesari capienda, etsi
prohibere Pompeius totis copiis et dimicare non constituerat,
tamen suis locis sagittarios funditoresque mittebat, quorum
magnum habebat numerum, multique ex nostris vulnerabantur,
magnusque incesserat timor sagittarum, atque omnes fere milites
aut ex coactis aut ex centonibus aut ex coriis tunicas aut
tegimenta fecerant, quibus tela vitarent.


Pompey was unwilling to withdraw from the sea and Dyrrachium,
because he had assembled all his military equipment - weapons,
arms, and engines - there and was transporting provisions to the
army by ship, nor could he hinder Caesar's fortifications without
fighting a battle; which he had decided not to do at that time.
All that was left to him, pursuing a truly strange plan of war,
was to capture as many hills as possible and to hold as much
territory as possible and to split Caesar's forces up as much as
possible; and this is what he did.  For, after completing 24
redoubts in a circle 15 miles around, he could forage in the
encompassed space; and much had been planted in this space that
he could graze his livestock on in the short while.  And, just as
our men made provision for a continous fortification to keep the
Pompeians from breaking out and attacking us from behind, they
accordingly erected continuous fortifications in this interior
space, to keep our men from getting in and coming round them from
behind.  But they beat us in building the fortifications, because
they were superior in the number their soldiers and the the inner
circle had a smaller circumference.  Whenever a position was
about to fall to Caesar, Pompey, despite having resolved not to
fight or hinder Caesar's forces, nevertheless sent archers and
slingers, of which he had a great number, to his positions, and
many of our men were wounded.  A great fear of the archers had
spread, and nearly all the soldiers had made coverings from
mattresses or quilts or leather tunics to protect themselves from
the arrows.
