44.1
Pompeius neque a mari Dyrrachioque discedere volebat,
quod omnem apparatum belli, tela, arma, tormenta ibi collocaverat
frumentumque exercitui navibus supportabat,
neque munitiones Caesaris prohibere poterat, nisi proelio decertare vellet;
quod eo tempore statuerat non esse faciendum.
Relinquebatur,
ut extremam rationem belli sequens quam plurimos colles occuparet et
quam latissimas regiones praesidiis teneret Caesarisque copias,
quam maxime posset, distineret; idque accidit.
Castellis enim XXIIII effectis XV milia passuum circuitu amplexus hoc
spatio pabulabatur;
multaque erant intra eum locum manu sata,
quibus interim iumenta pasceret.

Atque ut nostri perpetua munitione providebant,
ne quo loco erumperent Pompeiani ac nostros post tergum adorirentur,
ita illi interiore spatio perpetuas munitiones efficiebant,
ne quem locum nostri intrare atque ipsos a tergo circumvenire possent.

Sed illi operibus vincebant,
quod et numero militum praestabant et
interiore spatio minorem circuitum habebant.

Quaecumque erant loca Caesari capienda,
etsi prohibere Pompeius totis copiis et dimicare non constituerat,
tamen suis locis sagittarios funditoresque mittebat,
quorum magnum habebat numerum, multique ex nostris vulnerabantur,
magnusque incesserat timor sagittarum,
atque omnes fere milites aut ex coactis aut ex centonibus aut ex coriis tunicas aut tegimenta fecerant,
quibus tela vitarent.


Pompey didn't want to withdraw from the sea and Dyrrachium,
because he had assembled all his military equipment - weapons, arms, and engines
- there and was transporting provisions to the army by ship,
nor could he prevent Caesar's fortifications, without fighting a battle;
because at the time he had decided that it could not be done.

He was left, pursuing a truly strange plan of war,
to capture as many hills as possible, and
to hold as much territory as possible,
and to separate, as much as he could, Caesar's forces;
and this is what happened.

For he was foraging in the space encircled by the 24 redoubts that had been
erected in a circle 25 miles around;
and much was sown by hand within the location,
on which, in the meantime, he could graze the mules.

And to allow our men to make provision for a continous fortification
and keep the Pompeians from breaking out and attacking our men from behind,
they therefore erected continuous fortifications in this interior space,
to keep our men from entering that spot and attacking them from behind.

But they(we?) overran the fortifications,
because both by the number of soldiers they were superior and
to/by the inner space had a smaller circumference.

whatever spots of Caesar were about to be taken,
even though Pompey had not resolved to prevent to/by all forces and to fight,
nevertheless he sent archers and slingers, of which he had a great number,
to his positions, and many of our men were wounded,
and great fear of the archers had advanced,
and all nearly soldiers had made coverings from either mattresses or quilts or
leather tunics, with which to avoid the arrows.
