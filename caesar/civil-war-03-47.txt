47.1 Erat nova et inusitata belli ratio cum tot castellorum numero
tantoque spatio et tantis munitionibus et toto obsidionis genere,
tum etiam reliquis rebus.  Nam quicumque alterum obsidere conati
sunt, perculsos atque infirmos hostes adorti aut proelio superatos
aut aliqua offensione permotos continuerunt, cum ipsi numero equitum
militumque praestarent; causa autem obsidionis haec fere esse
consuevit, ut frumento hostes prohiberent.  At tum integras atque
incolumes copias Caesar inferiore militum numero continebat, cum
illi omnium rerum copia abundarent; cotidie enim magnus undique
navium numerus conveniebat, quae commeatum supportarent, neque ullus
flare ventus poterat, quin aliqua ex parte secundum cursum haberent.
Ipse autem consumptis omnibus longe lateque frumentis summis erat in
angustiis.  Sed tamen haec singulari patientia milites ferebant.
Recordabantur enim eadem se superiore anno in Hispania perpessos
labore et patientia maximum bellum confecisse, meminerant ad Alesiam
magnam se inopiam perpessos, multo etiam maiorem ad Avaricum,
maximarum gentium victores discessisse.  Non illi hordeum cum
daretur, non legumina recusabant; pecus vero cuius rei summa erat ex
Epiro copia, magno in honore habebant.


It was a novel and strange plan of war, not only in the number and
extent of the redoubts, both in the size of the fortifications and
in the whole character of the sieges, but in everything else as
well.  For whenever one side tries to blockade another, which they
outnumber them in horse and infantry, they fall upon a demoralized
and weakened enemy, and surround men either overcome by battle or
agitated by some accident.  And this is the most customary reason
for a siege, to keep the enemy from supplies.  But at that time
Caesar was outnumbered, and was blockading troops who were fresh,
sound and well supplied; for a great number of ships, carrying
provisions, were stopping in from every direction on a daily basis,
as any wind that blew was favorable for ships coming from somewhere.
While Caesar had used up all the crops around, far and wide, and was
in a squeeze.  But the soldiers nevertheless bore these things with
singular patience.  For they remembered that they themselves had
endured to the fullest with toil and patience a year back in Spain
and had brought a very great war to fruition.  They remembered that
they'd endured great privation at Alesia, and far greater at
Avaricum, and had marched off as victors over the greatest tribes.
They didn't refuse barley when it was given out, nor pulse; indeed,
cattle, which was supplied from Epirus in abundance, they held in
great honor as the ultimate business.
