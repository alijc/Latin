47.1
Erat nova et inusitata belli ratio
cum tot castellorum numero tantoque spatio et tantis munitionibus et toto obsidionis genere,
tum etiam reliquis rebus.

Nam quicumque alterum obsidere conati sunt,
perculsos atque infirmos hostes adorti aut proelio superatos aut aliqua
offensione permotos continuerunt,
cum ipsi numero equitum militumque praestarent;
causa autem obsidionis haec fere esse consuevit,
ut frumento hostes prohiberent.

At tum integras atque incolumes copias Caesar inferiore militum numero continebat,
cum illi omnium rerum copia abundarent;
cotidie enim magnus undique navium numerus conveniebat,
quae commeatum supportarent,
neque ullus flare ventus poterat,
quin aliqua ex parte secundum cursum haberent.

Ipse autem consumptis omnibus longe lateque frumentis summis erat in angustiis.
Sed tamen haec singulari patientia milites ferebant.

Recordabantur enim eadem se superiore anno in Hispania perpessos labore et patientia maximum bellum confecisse,
meminerant ad Alesiam magnam se inopiam perpessos,
multo etiam maiorem ad Avaricum,
maximarum gentium victores discessisse.

Non illi hordeum cum daretur, non legumina recusabant;
pecus vero cuius rei summa erat ex Epiro copia, magno in honore habebant.


It was a novel and strange plan of war,
not only in the extent of redoubts in number and area,
both in such great fortifications and in every sort of siege,
but also in everything else as well.

For whichever side tried to besiege the other
surrounded an enemy demoralized and weakened   of assailed
either overcome by battle or agitated by some accident,
when they outnumbered them in horse and infantry;
but for the sake of the siege this nearly to be he was inured,
to keep the enemy from supplies.

But then Caesar surrounded fresh, uninjured and well supplied troops with a inferior number of soldiers;
for a great number of ships, carrying provisions,
were stopping in from every direction on a daily basis,
as any wind that blew was favorable for ships coming from somewhere.

But he having used up all the crops to the bitter end, far and wide,
was in a squeeze.
But the soldiers nevertheless bore these things by patience alone.

For they remembered that they themselves
had endured to the fullest with toil and patience a year or two back in Spain
and had brought a very great war to fruition.

They wouldn't refuse barley when it was given out, nor pulse;
indeed, 
herd whose highest thing was supplied from Epirum,
they held in great honor.
