48.1 Est autem genus radicis inventum ab eis,
qui fuerant vacui ab operibus,
quod appellatur chara,
quod admixtum lacte multum inopiam levabat.
Id ad similitudinem panis efficiebant.
Eius erat magna copia.
Ex hoc effectos panes,
cum in colloquiis Pompeiani famem nostris obiectarent,
vulgo in eos iaciebant,
ut spem eorum minuerent.


But the the men who were not busy with work
discovered a kind of root, called chara,
that, when mixed with milk, greatly alleviated their want.
It somewhat resembled bread and there was a great deal of it.
After making loaves from this,
they'd publicly toss them at the Pompeians during parleys
when they charged our men with hunger,
to whittle away at their hopes.
