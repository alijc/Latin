51.1 Interim certior factus P. Sulla, quem discedens castris
praefecerat Caesar, auxilio cohorti venit cum legionibus duabus;
cuius adventu facile sunt repulsi Pompeiani.  Neque vero conspectum
aut impetum nostrorum tulerunt, primisque deiectis reliqui se
verterunt et loco cesserunt.  Sed insequentes nostros, ne longius
prosequerentur, Sulla revocavit.  At plerique existimant, si acrius
insequi voluisset, bellum eo die potuisse finire.  Cuius consilium
reprehendendum non videtur.  Aliae enim sunt legati partes atque
imperatoris: alter omnia agere ad praescriptum, alter libere ad
summam rerum consulere debet.  Sulla a Caesare in castris relictus
liberatis suis hoc fuit contentus neque proelio decertare voluit,
quae res tamen fortasse aliquem reciperet casum, ne imperatorias
sibi partes sumpsisse videretur.  Pompeianis magnam res ad receptum
difficultatem afferebat.  Nam ex iniquo progressi loco in summo
constiterant; si per declive sese reciperent, nostros ex superiore
insequentes loco verebantur; neque multum ad solis occasum temporis
supererat; spe enim conficiendi negotii prope in noctem rem
duxerant.  Ita necessario atque ex tempore capto consilio Pompeius
tumulum quendam occupavit, qui tantum aberat a nostro castello, ut
telum tormento missum adigi non posset.  Hoc consedit loco atque eum
communivit omnesque ibi copias continuit.

Meanwhile P. Sulla, whom Caesar had put in command of the camp on
his departure, was informed of this and came to the aid of the
cohort with two legions; and Pompey's forces were easily driven off
by his arrival.  Indeed they didn't bear even the sight let alone
the assault of our men, and after their leading ranks were cut down
the rest turned tail and ran.  But Sulla called our troops back from
pursuing them too far.  Now most of the men thought that if they'd
been allowed to pursue more keenly then they would have been able to
end the war that day.  But fault shouldn't be found with his plan.
For the officer and the general have different roles: one should do
what he's ordered to do, while the other is free to consider the
ultimate matters.  After Caesar had left Sulla in camp, he was
content with having delivered his men, and had no wish to fight out
a battle, a thing that might possibly admit some calamity.  And it
would have looked like he'd assumed a general's role to boot.  The
business of their retreat was producing a great difficulty for
Pompey's men.  For they'd stopped on a height after getting out of a
disadvanteous position; if they retreated down the slope, they
feared that our men would overtake them, starting from a higher
elevation.  And it wasn't long til sundown; for they had taken the
thing nearly into the night in the hope of finishing off the work.
So of necessity Pompey immediately latched onto a plan and seized a
mound, which was far enough away from our redoubt that a missle cast
by a windlass couldn't reach it.  He encamped in this position and
fortified it and secured all his forces there.
