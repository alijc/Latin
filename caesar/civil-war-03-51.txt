51.1
Interim certior factus P. Sulla,
quem discedens castris praefecerat Caesar,
auxilio cohorti venit cum legionibus duabus;
cuius adventu facile sunt repulsi Pompeiani.
Neque vero conspectum aut impetum nostrorum tulerunt,
primisque deiectis reliqui se verterunt et loco cesserunt.
Sed insequentes nostros, ne longius prosequerentur, Sulla revocavit.
At plerique existimant, si acrius insequi voluisset, bellum eo die potuisse finire.
Cuius consilium reprehendendum non videtur.
Aliae enim sunt legati partes atque imperatoris:
alter omnia agere ad praescriptum, alter libere ad summam rerum consulere debet.
Sulla a Caesare in castris relictus liberatis suis hoc fuit contentus neque
proelio decertare voluit, quae res tamen fortasse aliquem reciperet casum,
ne imperatorias sibi partes sumpsisse videretur.
Pompeianis magnam res ad receptum difficultatem afferebat.

Nam ex iniquo progressi loco in summo constiterant;
si per declive sese reciperent,
nostros ex superiore insequentes loco verebantur;
neque multum ad solis occasum temporis supererat;
spe enim conficiendi negotii prope in noctem rem duxerant.

Ita necessario atque ex tempore capto consilio Pompeius
tumulum quendam occupavit, qui tantum aberat a nostro castello, ut telum
tormento missum adigi non posset. Hoc consedit loco atque eum communivit
omnesque ibi copias continuit.

Meanwhile P. Sulla,
whom Caesar had put in command of the camp on his departure,
was informed and came to the aid of the cohort with two legions;
and Pompey's forces were easily driven off by his arrival.
Indeed they didn't bear even the sight let alone the assault of our men,
and after their leaders were cut down the rest turned tail and withdrew.
But Sulla recalled our troops from the pursuit, fearing that they
themselves would be pursued if they got too far away.
But most of the men thought that if they'd been allowed to pursue more keenly
then they would have been able to end the war that day.
And his plan didn't look like it was about to be held back/seized.
For the officer and the general have different roles:
one should do what he's ordered to do,
while the other should freely decide to the highest of things.
After Caesar had left Sulla in camp, he was stretched thin, what with
his men having been released, and had no wish to fight out a battle,
something that might possibly receive some calamity.
And it would have looked like he'd assumed a general's role to boot.
The business of their retreat was producing a great difficulty for 
Pompey's men.

For after getting out of a disadvanteous position they'd stopped on a height;
if they retreated down the slope,
they dreaded our men pursuing from a higher elevation;
and it wasn't long til sundown;

for of/by hope about to be accompllished/killed off of trouble nearly into night
>thing they had thought/led.
