52.1 Eodem tempore duobus praeterea locis pugnatum est: nam plura
castella Pompeius pariter distinendae manus causa temptaverat, ne
ex proximis praesidiis succurri posset.  Uno loco Volcatius
Tullus impetum legionis sustinuit cohortibus tribus atque eam
loco depulit; altero Germani munitiones nostras egressi
compluribus interfectis sese ad suos incolumes receperunt.

At the same time fighting was going on in two additional spots:
for Pompey had also attacked more redoubts to split our forces up
and keep them from aiding the nearby garrisons.  In one place
Volcatius Tullus withstood an attack of a legion with three
cohorts and drove it off; in the other Germans marched out of our
fortifications and then retreated to their lines with no
casualties, leaving several of the enemy dead.
