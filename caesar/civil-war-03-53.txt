53.1
Ita uno die VI proeliis factis, tribus ad Dyrrachium, tribus ad munitiones,
cum horum omnium ratio haberetur,
ad duo milia numero ex Pompeianis cecidisse reperiebamus,
evocatos centurionesque complures
(in eo fuit numero Valerius Flaccus L. filius eius, qui praetor Asiam obtinuerat);
signaque sunt militaria sex relata.
Nostri non amplius XX omnibus sunt proeliis desiderati.
Sed in castello nemo fuit omnino militum, quin vulneraretur,
quattuorque ex una cohorte centuriones oculos amiserunt.
Et cum laboris sui periculique testimonium afferre vellent,
milia sagittarum circiter XXX in castellum coniecta Caesari renumeraverunt,
scutoque ad eum relato Scaevae centurionis inventa sunt in eo foramina CXX.
Quem Caesar, ut erat de se meritus et de re publica,
donatum milibus CC collaudatumque ab octavis ordinibus ad primipilum se traducere pronuntiavit
(eius enim opera castellum magna ex parte conservatum esse constabat)
cohortemque postea duplici stipendio,
frumento, veste, cibariis militaribusque donis amplissime donavit.

So, a single day saw 6 battles,
three at Dyrrachium and three at the fortifications,
and when a reckoning of them all was totted up,
we learned that about two thousand of Pompey's forces had fallen,
many of them veterans and centurions
(among the number was Valerius Flaccus his son Lucius,
who had held Asia as praetor);
and six military standards were carried off.
No more than 20 of our men were lost in the battle.
But in the redoubt not one of the soldiers was entirely without wounds,
and in one cohort four centurions lost eyes.
And when they wished to give evidence of their toil and danger,
a thousand archers around 300 gathered in the redoubt reported to Caesar,
and brought him the centurion Scaeva's shield, in which 120 holes were found.
And Caesar announced that he,
as he had earned it from the republic and from Caesar himself,
transferred self gift to 200 soldiers and
commended from the eighth rank to first centurion
(for by his labors the redoubt was for the most part still standing)
and then very liberally granted the cohort double wages,
rations, clothing, provisions and military gifts.
