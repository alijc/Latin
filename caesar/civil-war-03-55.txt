55.1
Omnibus deinceps diebus Caesar exercitum in aciem aequum in locum produxit,
si Pompeius proelio decertare vellet,
ut paene castris Pompei legiones subiceret;
tantumque a vallo eius prima acies aberat,
uti ne telum tormento adigi posset.

Pompeius autem, ut famam opinionemque hominum teneret,
sic pro castris exercitum constituebat,
ut tertia acies vallum contingeret,
omnis quidem instructus exercitus telis ex vallo coniectis protegi posset.


During all the succeeding days,
Caesar led his army forward into battle array on level ground,
in case Pompey wanted to fight it out,
to nearly expose his legions by/to Pompey's camp;
and such from his palisade the front line was distant,
so that lest windlass missile to be cast could.

But Pompey, to hold on to the fame and opinion of men,
thus positioned his army in front of the camp
so that the third line touched the palisade.

indeed each army having been equipped with javelins from the palisade thrown
down to be covered he could.
