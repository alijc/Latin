56.1 Aetolia, Acarnania, Amphilochis per Cassium Longinum et
Calvisium Sabinum, ut demonstravimus, receptis temptandam sibi
Achaiam ac paulo longius progrediendum existimabat Caesar.
Itaque eo Calenum misit eique Sabinum et Cassium cum cohortibus
adiungit.  Quorum cognito adventu Rutilius Lupus, qui Achaiam
missus a Pompeio obtinebat, Isthmum praemunire instituit, ut
Achaia Fufium prohiberet.  Calenus Delphos, Thebas, Orchomenum
voluntate ipsarum civitatium recepit, nonnullas urbes per vim
expugnavit, reliquas civitates circummissis legationibus amicitia
Caesari conciliare studebat.  In his rebus fere erat Fufius
occupatus.

With Aetolia, Acarnania, and Amphilochis taken by Cassius
Longinus and Calvisius Sabinus, as we have described, Caesar
considered probing Achaia and advancing a bit further.  And so he
sent Calenus there and attached Sabinus and Cassius, with their
cohorts, to him.  When their arrival was discovered, Rutilius
Lupus, who had been sent by Pompey and was occupying Achia, set
about fortifying the Isthmus, to keep Fufius out of Achaia.
Calenus took Delphi, Thebes, and Orchomenum, with the consent of
those cities, conquered several cities through force, and sent
legions around to the rest of the cities and strove to win them
over to Caesar's alliance.  Fufius Calenus was generally occupied
in this business.
