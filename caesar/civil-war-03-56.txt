Aetolia, Acarnania, Amphilochis per Cassium Longinum et Calvisium Sabinum,
ut demonstravimus, receptis temptandam sibi Achaiam ac paulo
longius progrediendum existimabat Caesar.
Itaque eo Calenum misit eique Sabinum et Cassium cum cohortibus adiungit.
Quorum cognito adventu Rutilius Lupus,
qui Achaiam missus a Pompeio obtinebat,
Isthmum praemunire instituit,
ut Achaia Fufium prohiberet.
Calenus Delphos, Thebas, Orchomenum voluntate ipsarum civitatium recepit,
nonnullas urbes per vim expugnavit,
reliquas civitates circummissis legationibus amicitia Caesari conciliare studebat.
In his rebus fere erat Fufius occupatus.

With Aetolia, Acarnania, and Amphilochis
taken by Cassius Longinus and Calvisius Sabinus, as we have described,
Caesar considered probing Achaia and advancing a bit further.
And so he sent Calenus and Sabinus there and added Cassius, with his cohorts, as
well.
When their arrival was discovered, Rutilius Lupus,
who had been sent by Pompey and was occupying Achia,
set about fortifying the isthmus, to keep Fufius out of Achaia.
Calenus took Delphi, Thebes, and Orchomenum, with the consent of those cities,
he conquered several cities through force,
he sent legions around to the rest of the cities and strove to win them over
to Caesar's alliance.
In this business Fufius Calenus was nearly captured.
