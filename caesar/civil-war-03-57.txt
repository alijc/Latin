57.1
Haec cum in Achaia atque apud Dyrrachium gererentur,
Scipionemque in Macedoniam venisse constaret,
non oblitus pristini instituti Caesar mittit ad eum A. Clodium,
suum atque illius familiarem,
quem ab illo traditum initio
et commendatum in suorum necessariorum numero habere instituerat.
Huic dat litteras mandataque ad eum; quorum haec erat summa:
sese omnia de pace expertum nihil adhuc effecisse:
hoc arbitrari vitio factum eorum,
quos esse auctores eius rei voluisset,
quod sua mandata perferre non opportuno tempore ad Pompeium vererentur.
Scipionem ea esse auctoritate,
ut non solum libere quae probasset exponere,
sed etiam ex magna parte compellere atque errantem regere posset;
praeesse autem suo nomine exercitui,
ut praeter auctoritatem vires quoque ad coercendum haberet.
Quod si fecisset, quietem Italiae, pacem provinciarum,
salutem imperii uni omnes acceptam relaturos.

Haec ad eum mandata Clodius refert ac primis diebus,
ut videbatur, libenter auditus reliquis ad colloquium non admittitur,
castigato Scipione a Favonio,
ut postea confecto bello reperiebamus,
infectaque re sese ad Caeaarem recepit.


While these things were being done in Achaia and at Dyrrachium,
and when Caesar resolved to go to Scipio,
keeping the original plan in mind, he sent to him A. Clodius
(a good friend to them both),
and decided to have Scipio entrust him with a number of necessities to be
delivered to Caesar.
He gave Clodius letters and orders for Scipio; of which this one was paramount:
that he had up to now accomplished nothing at all concrete concerning peace:
that this fact was judged to his detriment,
those whom he might have wished to be authors of this matter,
since they might fear to carry out his orders at a time not suitable to Pompey.
That Scipio was by the authority,
so that he could not only frankly explain the things that he had approved,
but even to compel in most part and to guide the straying;
but to command the army in his own name,
so that he might hold strength as well as authority up to restraint.
But if he had done anything, >calm of Italy, >peace of the provinces,
safety of the state to one all men >received >those about to bring home.
Clodius carried these commissions to him and in the first days, as it seemed,
willingly having heard to/by the remains to discussion not was admitted, 
Scipio having been chatised by Favonius,
as afterwards when the war was over, we discovered,
and without having accomplished it returned to Caesar.
