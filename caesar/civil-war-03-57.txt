57.1 Haec cum in Achaia atque apud Dyrrachium gererentur,
Scipionemque in Macedoniam venisse constaret, non oblitus
pristini instituti Caesar mittit ad eum A. Clodium, suum atque
illius familiarem, quem ab illo traditum initio et commendatum in
suorum necessariorum numero habere instituerat.  Huic dat
litteras mandataque ad eum; quorum haec erat summa: sese omnia de
pace expertum nihil adhuc effecisse: hoc arbitrari vitio factum
eorum, quos esse auctores eius rei voluisset, quod sua mandata
perferre non opportuno tempore ad Pompeium vererentur.  Scipionem
ea esse auctoritate, ut non solum libere quae probasset exponere,
sed etiam ex magna parte compellere atque errantem regere posset;
praeesse autem suo nomine exercitui, ut praeter auctoritatem
vires quoque ad coercendum haberet.  Quod si fecisset, quietem
Italiae, pacem provinciarum, salutem imperii uni omnes acceptam
relaturos.  Haec ad eum mandata Clodius refert ac primis diebus,
ut videbatur, libenter auditus reliquis ad colloquium non
admittitur, castigato Scipione a Favonio, ut postea confecto
bello reperiebamus, infectaque re sese ad Caeaarem recepit.


While these things were going on in Achaia and at Dyrrachium, and
when it was known that Scipio had come to Macedonia, keeping his
original intention in mind, Caesar sent A. Clodius (a good friend
to them both) to him, whom he had decided to take into his circle
after Scipio had recommended him.  He gave Clodius letters and
commissions for Scipio; of which this was paramount: that he had
up to now accomplished nothing at all concrete concerning peace:
that this fact was judged to his detriment; since those whom he
had wished to take a hand in this matter were afraid to carry his
commissions to Pompey at the proper time.  That Scipio was in
authority, so that he could not only frankly explain the things
that he had approved, but even to compel in most part and to
guide the straying; that he commanded the army in his own name,
to have authority and also power held in restraint.  But if he
were to do something, then everyone altogether would give him
credit for the tranquility of Italy, the peace of the provinces,
the safety of the state.  Clodius carried these commissions to
him and in the first days, as it seemed, was willingly heard, but
in succeeeding days was given access to parley, as Scipio had
been chatised by Favonius, as we discovered later when the war
was over, and without having accomplished anything he returned to
Caesar.
