58.1 Caesar, quo facilius equitatum Pompeianum ad Dyrrachium
contineret et pabulatione prohiberet, aditus duos, quos esse
angustos demonstravimus, magnis operibus praemunivit castellaque
his locis posuit.  Pompeius, ubi nihil profici equitatu cognovit,
paucis intermissis diebus rursus eum navibus ad se intra
munitiones recipit.  Erat summa inopia pabuli, adeo ut foliis ex
arboribus strictis et teneris harundinum radicibus contusis equos
alerent (frumenta enim, quae fuerant intra munitiones sata,
consumpserant); cogebantur Corcyra atque Acarnania longo
interiecto navigationis spatio pabulum supportare, quodque erat
eius rei minor copia, hordeo adaugere atque his rationibus
equitatum tolerare.  Sed postquam non modo hordeum pabulumque
omnibus locis herbaeque desectae, sed etiam frons ex arboribus
deficiebat, corruptis equis macie conandum sibi aliquid Pompeius
de eruptione existimavit.


Caesar, in order to more easily contain Pompey's cavalry at
Dyrrachium and prevent them from foraging, fortified the two
approaches, which we have shown to be confined, with large works,
and erected redoubts in these places.  Pompey, when he realized
that he could accomplish nothing with his cavalry, withdrew it
back to his fortifictions by ship after a few days.  There was an
extreme lack of fodder, to such a pass that they were feeding the
horses with leaves stripped off from trees and the crushed young
roots of reeds (for the grain that had been sown inside the
fortifications had been eaten up); they were forced to transport
fodder from Corcyra and Acarnania in voyages over the long
intervening distance, and, because there was a small supply of the
stuff, to augment it with barley, and the cavalry endured by these
means.  But after not only the barley and fodder and the mown
grass everywhere, but even the foliage from the trees was
insufficient, with horses broken with hunger Pompey considered
attempting a sortie.
