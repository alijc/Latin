60.1
Caesar neque tempus illud animadversionis esse existimans
et multa virtuti eorum concedens rem totam distulit;
illos secreto castigavit, quod quaestui equites haberent, monuitque,
ut ex sua amicitia omnia exspectarent et ex praeteritis suis officiis reliqua sperarent.
Magnam tamen haec res illis offensionem et contemptionem ad omnes attulit,
idque ita esse cum ex aliorum obiectationibus tum etiam ex domestico
iudicio atque animi conscientia intellegebant.
Quo pudore adducti et fortasse non se liberari,
sed in aliud tempus reservari arbitrati discedere a nobis
et novam temptare fortunam novasque amicitias experiri constituerunt.

Et cum paucis collocuti clientibus suis,
quibus tantum facinus committere audebant,
primum conati sunt praefectum equitum C. Volusenum interficere,
ut postea bello confecto cognitum est,
ut cum munere aliquo perfugisse ad Pompeium viderentur;

postquam id difficilius visum est neque facultas perficiendi dabatur,
quam maximas potuerunt pecunias mutuati,
proinde ac si suis satisfacere et fraudata restituere vellent,
multis coemptis equis ad Pompeium transierunt cum eis,
quos sui consilii participes habebant.


Caesar, judging that it was not the right time for punishment,
and pardoning much for the sake of their courage, put the entire matter off.
He reprimanded them in private, because they'd managed the cavalry for profit,
and warned them that they should expect to have lost his friendship in all
respects, and should look forward to future events from their past offices.
But this matter brought them great displeasure and scorn with everyone,
and they understood that it was so as from the reproaches of others
and moreover from personal judgement and a remorse of the soul.
Persuaded by this shame,
they decided that not only were they were not necessarily acquitted,
but, thinking that they'd been spared for another time,
that they should leave us and try a change of fortune and new alliances.

And after conferring with a few of their comrades,
with whom they were prepared to commit such an outrage,
they first attempted to kill C. Volusenus, the commander of horse
(as was discovered after the war was over)
so that they'd appear to have fled to Pompey with some sort of gift.

But they found no opportunity to accomplish this,
and then it seemed more difficult 

than >great monies they had been able having been borrowed, and so,
if they wanted to compensate their friends and restore what they'd embezzled,
after buying many horses they crossed over to Pompey with the men
with whom they had shared their plan.
