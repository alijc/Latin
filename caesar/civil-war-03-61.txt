61.1 Quos Pompeius, quod erant honesto loco nati et instructi
liberaliter magnoque comitatu et multis iumentis venerant virique
fortes habebantur et in honore apud Caesarem fuerant, quodque
novum et praeter consuetudinem acciderat, omnia sua praesidia
circumduxit atque ostentavit. Nam ante id tempus nemo aut miles
aut eques a Caesare ad Pompeium transierat, cum paene cotidie a
Pompeio ad Caesarem perfugerent, vulgo vero universi in Epiro
atque Aetolia conscripti milites earumque regionum omnium, quae a
Caesare tenebantur. Sed hi cognitis omnibus rebus, seu quid in
munitionibus perfectum non erat, seu quid a peritioribus rei
militaris desiderari videbatur, temporibusque rerum et spatiis
locorum, custodiarum varia diligentia animadversa, prout cuiusque
eorum, qui negotiis praeerant, aut natura aut studium ferebat,
haec ad Pompeium omnia detulerunt.


And because they had been born to an respectable position and
genteelly brought up and had arrived with a large company and
many pack horses and were held to be courageous men and had been
in Caesar's regard, and because what had happened was new and out
of the norm, Pompey took them all around the garrison and show
them off. For before this time no one, either infantry or
calvary, had crossed over from Caesar to Pompey, while men
deserted Pompey for Caesar nearly every day, usually, indeed,
soldiers conscripted in Epirus and Aetolia and all the regions
that were held by Caesar. But these men knew about everything,
from which fortifications had not been completed to what
expertise seemed to be lacking in military matters and the times
of events and distances between positions, the diligence in
watchfulness of the various guards, and for each man in charge of
each task, either his nature or the zeal he bore. And they
carried all of this to Pompey.
