62.1
Quibus ille cognitis rebus eruptionisque iam ante capto consilio,
ut demonstratum est,
tegimenta galeis milites ex viminibus facere atque aggerem iubet comportare.
His paratis rebus magnum numerum levis armaturae
et sagittariorum aggeremque omnem noctu in scaphas et naves actuarias imponit
et de media nocte cohortes LX ex maximis castris praesidiisque deductas
ad eam partem munitionum ducit, quae pertinebant ad mare
longissimeque a maximis castris Caesaris aberant.
Eodem naves, quas demonstravimus,
aggere et levis armaturae militibus completas,
quasque ad Dyrrachium naves longas habebat, mittit et,
quid a quoque fieri velit, praecipit.
Ad eas munitiones Caesar Lentulum Marcellinum quaestorem cum legione VIIII
positum habebat.

Huic, quod valetudine minus commoda utebatur,
Fulvium Postumum adiutorem submiserat.


When Caesar was informed of these events and sallies
through captured intelligence, as has been described,
he ordered the soldiers to make coverings for their helmets from twigs
and to pile up a rampart.
After these things had been prepared he positioned
a great number of light infantry and archers
and >the entire rampart by night into skiffs and light ships
and about the middle of the night he led 60 cohortes drawn from the largest
camps and garrisons to that part of the fortifications, extended to the sea
and which were the furthest from Caesar's largest camp.
To the same purpose he sent ships, which we have described,
to the rampart and manned them with light infantry,
and galleys that he had at Dyrrachium, and,
he instructed what he wanted to be done by each.
Caesar had the quaestor Lentulus Marcellinus placed
at the fortifications with the 9th legion.
And because he was not in the best of health,
he placed Fulvius Postumus under him as his deputy.
