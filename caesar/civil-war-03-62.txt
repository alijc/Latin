62.1 Quibus ille cognitis rebus eruptionisque iam ante capto
consilio, ut demonstratum est, tegimenta galeis milites ex
viminibus facere atque aggerem iubet comportare.  His paratis
rebus magnum numerum levis armaturae et sagittariorum aggeremque
omnem noctu in scaphas et naves actuarias imponit et de media
nocte cohortes LX ex maximis castris praesidiisque deductas ad
eam partem munitionum ducit, quae pertinebant ad mare
longissimeque a maximis castris Caesaris aberant.  Eodem naves,
quas demonstravimus, aggere et levis armaturae militibus
completas, quasque ad Dyrrachium naves longas habebat, mittit et,
quid a quoque fieri velit, praecipit.  Ad eas munitiones Caesar
Lentulum Marcellinum quaestorem cum legione VIIII positum
habebat.  Huic, quod valetudine minus commoda utebatur, Fulvium
Postumum adiutorem submiserat.


When Pompey was informed of these events and since he had already
planned on a sortie, as has been described, he ordered the
soldiers to make coverings for their helmets from twigs and to
collect material for a rampart.  After these things had been
prepared he put a great number of light infantry and archers and
all the material aboard skiffs and light ships in the night and
about the middle of the night he led 60 cohortes drawn from the
largest camps and garrisons to the part of the fortifications
that extended to the sea and were the furthest from Caesar's
largest camp.  He sent ships, which we have described, to the
same place, filled with light infantry and material for ramparts,
as well as the galleys that he had at Dyrrachium, and instructed
what he wanted done by each one.  Caesar had posted the quaestor
Lentulus Marcellinus at these fortifications with the 9th legion.
And because he was not in the best of health, he placed Fulvius
Postumus under him as his deputy.
