Erat eo loco fossa pedum XV et vallum contra hostem in altitudinem pedum X,
tantundemque eius valli agger in latitudinem patebat:
ab eo intermisso spatio pedum DC alter conversus in contrariam partem erat
vallus humiliore paulo munitione.
Hoc enim superioribus diebus timens Caesar,
ne navibus nostri circumvenirentur,
duplicem eo loco fecerat vallum,
ut, si ancipiti proelio dimicaretur, posset resisti.
Sed operum magnitudo et continens omnium dierum labor,
quod milium passuum in circuitu XVII munitiones erat complexus,
perficiendi spatium non dabat.
Itaque contra mare transversum vallum,
qui has duas munitiones coniungeret, nondum perfecerat.
Quae res nota erat Pompeio delata per Allobrogas perfugas,
magnumque nostris attulerat incommodum.
Nam ut ad mare duo cohortes nonae legionis excubuerant,
accessere subito prima luce Pompeiani;
simul navibus circumvecti milites in exteriorem vallum tela iaciebant,
fossaeque aggere complebantur,
et legionarii interioris munitionis defensores scalis admotis tormentis
cuiusque generis telisque terrebant,
magnaque multitudo sagittariorum ab utraque parte circumfundebatur.
Multum autem ab ictu lapidum, quod unum nostris erat telum,
viminea tegimenta galeis imposita defendebant.

Itaque cum omnibus rebus nostri premerentur
atque aegre resisterent animadversum est vitium munitionis,
quod supra demonstratum est, atque inter duos vallos,
qua perfectum opus non erat,
Pompeiani navibus expositi in aversos nostros impetum fecerunt
atque ex utraque munitione deiectos terga vertere coegerunt.


In this place was a 15 foot ditch and a 10 foot high palisade facing the enemy,
and a rampart extended in width just as much as its palisade: 
600 feet away from the gap left in this space
another palisade was turned back to the opposite side
from a fortification that was a bit lower.
For in recent days Caesar, fearing that our men might be surrounded by ships,
had built a double wall in this place,
so that a battle on two fronts could be opposed.
But due to the size of the fortifications and all of the labor it would take,
because the fortifications took up a space 17 miles in circumference 17,
time was not given for completing the work.
And so he had not yet completed a flanking palisade facing the sea,
which joined these two fortifications.
Which had been found out by Pompey, conveyed by the Allobrogian deserters.
For while two cohorts of the ninth legion had kept watch by the sea,
the Pompeians approached unexpectedly at first light;
at the same time soldiers traveling in ships were hurling spears at the outer
palisade,
and the ditches were being filled in,
and the legions who were defending the inner fortifications
having brought up ladders
siege engines and of which sort and spears were frightening,
and were surrounded by a great mass of archers by each side.
But much/greatly by the blow of stones, that/because one spear to/by our men was
their wickerwork helmet covers warded off.
And so when to/by all things our men were hard pressed and scarcely withstood
it was observed the defect of the fortifications,
which was mentioned above, and between the two palisades,
where the work was not completed,
The Pompeians disembarked from their ships against our men from behind made an
assault
and from each fortification >thrown out men back turned they forced.
