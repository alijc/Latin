64.1
Hoc tumultu nuntiato Marcellinus cohortes subsidio nostris laborantibus submittit ex castris;
quae fugientes conspicatae
neque illos suo adventu confirmare potuerunt
neque ipsae hostium impetum tulerunt.
Itaque quodcumque addebatur subsidii,
id corruptum timore fugientium terrorem et periculum augebat;
hominum enim multitudine receptus impediebatur.
In eo proelio cum gravi vulnere esset affectus aquilifer
et a viribus deficeretur, conspicatus equites nostros,
"hanc ego," inquit, "et vivus multos per annos magna diligentia defendi et
nunc moriens eadem fide Caesari restituo.
Nolite, obsecro, committere, quod ante in exercitu Caesaris non accidit,
ut rei militaris dedecus admittatur, incolumemque ad eum deferte."
Hoc casu aquila conservatur omnibus primae cohortis centurionibus interfectis praeter principem priorem.

After the tumult was reported to him,
Marcellinus sent out cohortes from the camp
as reinforcements to our men in distress;
who, when they caught sight of the fleeing men,
could neither strengthen them by means of their own arrival
nor themselves bear the enemy's assault.
And so whatever relief was added,
it, infected by fear, increased the panic of those fleeing and the danger;
for the retreat was obstructed by the mass of men.
In this battle when the standard-bearer was afflict by a grave wound
and his strength failed him, he caught sight of our cavalry and said,
"I, living, protected this for many years with great diligence and
now, dying, I make good Caesar's trust.
I beg you, don't be guilty of what has never before happened in Caesar's army,
permitting disgrace in a military matter, and carry it to him safe and sound."
From this fate the standard was preserved by all the men
of the first cohort to/by the killed centurions besides the first leading.
