67.1 Eo signa legionis illata speculatores Caesari renuntiarunt.
Hoc idem visum ex superioribus quibusdam castellis confirmaverunt.
Is locus aberat a novis Pompei castris circiter passus quingentos.
Hanc legionem sperans Caesar se opprimere posse et cupiens eius diei detrimentum sarcire,
reliquit in opere cohortes duas, quae speciem munitionis praeberent;
ipse diverso itinere quam potuit occultissime reliquas cohortes, numero XXXIII,
in quibus erat legio nona multis amissis centurionibus deminutoque militum numero,
ad legionem Pompei castraque minora duplici acie eduxit.
Neque eum prima opinio fefellit.
Nam et pervenit prius, quam Pompeius sentire posset,
et tametsi erant munitiones castrorum magnae, tamen sinistro cornu,
ubi erat ipse, celeriter aggressus Pompeianos ex vallo deturbavit.
Erat obiectus portis ericius.
Hic paulisper est pugnatum, cum irrumpere nostri conarentur,
illi castra defenderent, fortissime T. Pulieone,
cuius opera proditum exercitum C. Antoni demonstravimus, eo loco propugnante.
Sed tamen nostri virtute vicerunt excisoque ericio primo in maiora castra,
post etiam in castellum, quod erat inclusum maioribus castris, irruperunt,
quo pulsa legio sese receperat, et nonnullos ibi repugnantes interfecerunt.


After the legion's standards were carried there, the scouts reported to Caesar.
They confirmed that the same thing had been seen from some higher redoubts.
The site was about half a mile away from Pompey's new camp.
Caesar, apprehending that this legion could fall upon him
and desiring to redeem his defeat of the day,
left two cohorts in the fortifications
to give it the appearance of being defended.
He himself led out the rest of the cohorts, 33 in number,
among which was the ninth legion, which had lost many centurions and a smaller
number of soldiers, as covertly as possible by a roundabout route
in a double line towards Pompey's legion and his smaller camp.
And his first opinion didn't disappoint him.
For he not only arrived earlier than Pompey could realize, but,
even though the camp had strong fortifications,
yet at the left corner, where he was,
he swiftly attacked Pompey's forces and drove them away from the palisade.
A spiked beam had been thrown down at the gate.

There was a brief fight here when our forces attempted to rush in,
they defended the camp, most strongly T. Pulieone,
whose labor >the advanced army of C. Antonius we have shown,
fighting in that spot.

But still our men courageously triumphed and after first destroying the spiked
beam surged into the larger camp,
and later still into the its enclosed redoubt,
into which the legion had retreated after being driven out of the larger camp,
and killed several who were fighting back there.
