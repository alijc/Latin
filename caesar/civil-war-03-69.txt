69.1 Interim Pompeius hac satis longa interiecta mora et re
nuntiata V legiones ab opere deductas subsidio suis duxit,
eodemque tempore equitatus eius nostris equitibus appropinquabat,
et acies instructa a nostris, qui castra occupaverant,
cernebatur, omniaque sunt subito mutata.  Legio Pompeiana celeris
spe subsidii confirmata ab decumana porta resistere conabatur
atque ultro in nostros impetum faciebat.  Equitatus Caesaris,
quod angusto itinere per aggeres ascendebat, receptui suo timens
initium fugae faciebat.  Dextrum cornu, quod erat a sinistro
seclusum, terrore equitum animadverso, ne intra munitionem
opprimeretur, ea parte, quam proruerat, sese recipiebat, ac
plerique ex his, ne in angustias inciderent, ex X pedum munitione
se in fossas praecipitabant, primisque oppressis reliqui per
horum corpora salutem sibi atque exitum pariebant.  Sinistro
cornu milites, cum ex vallo Pompeium adesse et suos fugere
cernerent, veriti, ne angustiis intercluderentur, cum extra et
intus hostem haberent, eodem, quo venerant, receptu sibi
consulebant, omniaque erant tumultus, timoris, fugae plena, adeo
ut, cum Caesar signa fugientium manu prenderet et consistere
iuberet, alii admissis equis eodem cursu confugerent, alii metu
etiam signa dimitterent, neque quisquam omnino consisteret.


Meanwhile, when this had been reported, after a moderately long
delay, Pompey led 5 legions, drawn away from the fortifications,
to reinforce his men.  And at the same time as his cavalry was
approaching our own, he made out a battle array, made up of our
men who had seized the camp, and everything suddenly shifted.
The Pompeian legion, assured in a hope of swift relief, undertook
to make a stand from the main gate, and made an assault on our
men.  Since Caesar's horse was climbing through the rampart by
confined paths, they were apprehensive of their retreat and were
making the beginning of flight.  When the right wing, which was
far from the left one, observed the cavalry's fear of being
overwhelmed within the fortifications, it retreated from the part
that it had rushed forward into, and a good many of them, to keep
from being attacked in the narrow passages, threw themselves
headlong from the fortifications 10 feet down into ditches, and
while the first ones were crushed, the rest procured salvation
and a way out for themselves by means of their bodies.  When the
soldiers on the left wing saw from the wall that Pompey was
present and that their men were fleeing, afraid that they'd be
cut off in the narrow ways since they thought that their enemy
was both within and without, they were contemplating retreating
back the same way they'd come.  There was nothing but confusion,
fear, and full flight, to the point that when Caesar grabbed at
the standards of those fleeing and ordered them to stand firm,
some spurred their horses on and fled on the same course, while
others even dropped the standards from fear, and not a single man
made a stand.
