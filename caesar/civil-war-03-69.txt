*69.1
Interim Pompeius hac satis longa interiecta mora et re nuntiata V
legiones ab opere deductas subsidio suis duxit,
eodemque tempore equitatus eius nostris equitibus appropinquabat,
et acies instructa a nostris,
qui castra occupaverant, cernebatur,
omniaque sunt subito mutata.
Legio Pompeiana celeris spe subsidii confirmata ab decumana
porta resistere conabatur atque ultro in nostros impetum faciebat.
Equitatus Caesaris, quod angusto itinere per aggeres ascendebat,
receptui suo timens initium fugae faciebat.
Dextrum cornu, quod erat a sinistro seclusum, terrore equitum animadverso,
ne intra munitionem opprimeretur, ea parte, quam proruerat, sese recipiebat,
ac plerique ex his, ne in angustias inciderent,
ex X pedum munitione se in fossas praecipitabant,
primisque oppressis reliqui per horum corpora salutem sibi atque exitum pariebant.

Sinistro cornu milites, cum ex vallo Pompeium adesse et suos fugere cernerent,
veriti, ne angustiis intercluderentur, cum extra et intus hostem haberent,

eodem, quo venerant, receptu sibi consulebant, omniaque erant tumultus, timoris,
fugae plena, adeo ut,
cum Caesar signa fugientium manu prenderet et consistere iuberet,
alii admissis equis eodem cursu confugerent,
alii metu etiam signa dimitterent, neque quisquam omnino consisteret.


Meanwhile, when this had been reported, after a moderately long delay,
Pompey led 5 legions, drawn away from the fortifications, to reinforce his men,
and soon his cavalry was approaching our own.
When he saw the battle array, made up of our men who had seized the camp, 
everything suddenly shifted.
The Pompeian legion, assured in a hope of swift relief from the tenth legion,
attempted to make a stand at the gate
and were making an assault on our men besides.
Caesar's horse, because they were climbing by confined paths over the ramparts,
were fearful of their retreat and were making the beginning of flight.
When the right wing, which was far from the left one,
observed the cavalry's fear of being overwhelmed within the fortifications,
it retreated from the part that it had rushed forward into,
and most of them, to keep from being attacked in the narrow passages,
threw themselves headlong from the fortifications 10 feet down into ditches,
and while the first ones were crushed, the rest procured salvation
and a way out for themselves by means their bodies.
When the soldiers on the left wing saw from the wall
that Pompey was present and that their men were fleeing,
afraid that they'd be cut off in the narrow ways
since they thought that their enemy was both within and without,
they were contemplating retreating back the same way they'd come,
and there was everything of confusion, fear, and full flight,
to the point that when Caesar caught up with the standards
in the hands of those fleeing and ordered them to stand firm,
some spurred their horses on and took refuge to the same place by course,
while others from fear even threw the standards away,
and no man at all made a stand.
