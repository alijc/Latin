70.1 His tantis malis haec subsidia succurrebant, quo minus omnis
deleretur exercitus, quod Pompeius insidias timens, credo, quod haec
praeter spem acciderant eius, qui paulo ante ex castris fugientes
suos conspexerat, munitionibus appropinquare aliquamdiu non audebat,
equitesque eius angustis spatiis atque his ab Caesaris militibus
occupatis ad insequendum tardabantur.  Ita parvae res magnum in
utramque partem momentum habuerunt.  Munitiones enim a castris ad
flumen perductae expugnatis iam castris Pompei prope iam expeditam
Caesaris victoriam interpellaverunt, eadem res celeritate
insequentium tardata nostris salutem attulit.


These reinforcements ran to succor them from these great calamities
and the whole army was not completely wiped out, because Pompey,
fearing an ambush, since, I believe, of what had happened to him,
contrary to hope, when he'd just witnessed his men fleeing the camp,
dared not approach the fortifications, and his cavalry was unable
to pursue because the passages were narrow and Caesar's soldiers had
seized them.  Accordingly, small matters held great importance for
both sides.  For with Pompey's camp now under assault, the
fortifications that had been built from the camp to the river now
prevented a swift victory for Caesar, while the same thing saved our
men when the speed of our pursuers was impeded.
