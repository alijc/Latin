70.1 His tantis malis haec subsidia succurrebant,
quo minus omnis deleretur exercitus,
quod Pompeius insidias timens,
credo, quod haec praeter spem acciderant eius,
qui paulo ante ex castris fugientes suos conspexerat,
munitionibus appropinquare aliquamdiu non audebat,
equitesque eius angustis spatiis
atque his ab Caesaris militibus occupatis ad insequendum tardabantur.
Ita parvae res magnum in utramque partem momentum habuerunt.

Munitiones enim a castris ad flumen perductae expugnatis iam castris Pompei
prope iam expeditam Caesaris victoriam interpellaverunt,
eadem res celeritate insequentium tardata nostris salutem attulit.


These reinforcements ran to succor them from these great evils,
whereby less than the whole army was wiped out,
because Pompey, fearing an ambush, I believe,
because, contrary to hope, these events had befallen him,
who a little before had witnessed his men fleeing from the camp.
He dared not approach the fortifications,
and his cavalry was unable to pursue because of the narrow passageways
and those that Caesar's soldiers had seized.
Thus small matters held great importance on both sides.

for the fortifications that had been built from the camp to the river
with Pompey's camp now under assault 
by now nearly prevented Caesar's imminent victory,
the same thing brought safety to our men with the speed of what followed
the things that were hindered.
