Duobus his unius diei proeliis Caesar desideravit milites DCCCCLX
et notos equites Romanos Tuticanum Gallum,
senatoris filium, C. Fleginatem Placentia, A. Granium Puteolis,
M. Sacrativirum Capua, tribunos militum et centuriones XXXII;
sed horum omnium pars magna in fossis
munitionibusque et fluminis ripis oppressa suorum in terrore ac fuga
sine ullo vulnere interiit;
signaque sunt militaria amissa XXXII.
Pompeius eo proelio imperator est appellatus.
Hoc nomen obtinuit atque ita se postea salutari passus est,
sed neque in litteris scribere est solitus,
neque in fascibus insignia laureae praetulit.
At Labienus, cum ab eo impetravisset,
ut sibi captivos tradi iuberet,
omnes productos ostentationis,
ut videbatur, causa, quo maior perfugae fides haberetur,
commilitones appellans et magna verborum contumelia interrogans,
solerentne veterani milites fugere, in omnium conspectu interfecit.


For these two battles in a single day Caesar required 960 soldiers
and the famous Roman cavalry >Tutucanus the Gaul, a senator's son,
C. Fleginate Placentia, A. Granius Puteolis,
M. Sacrativirus from? Capua, 32 military tribunes and centurions.
But a great many of all these, trampled in trenches and fortifications and banks
of rivers by their own comrades in panic and flight,
perished without any wound, and 32 military standards were lost.
As a result of this battle Pompey was called Conqueror.
He maintained this title and afterwards allowed himself to be so saluted,
but was not in the habit of writing it in letters,
nor did he display it in insignias of bundled laurel.

But Labienus, when he had procured from him,
to self >prisoners to surrender he might command,
all having been led out of exhibition,
that he might seem, a reason, by which greater deserters loyalty he might have,
comrades calling and with great abuse of words interrogating,
is it not experienced soldiers to flee in the sight of all he killed.
