72.1 His rebus tantum fiduciae ac spiritus Pompeianis accessit,
ut non de ratione belli cogitarent, sed vicisse iam viderentur.
Non illi paucitatem nostrorum militum,
non iniquitatem loci atque angustias praeoccupatis castris et ancipitem terrorem intra extraque munitiones,
non abscisum in duas partes exercitum,
cum altera alteri auxilium ferre non posset, causae fuisse cogitabant.
Non ad haec addebant non concursu acri facto, non proelio dimicatum,
sibique ipsos multitudine atque angustiis maius attulisse detrimentum,
quam ab hoste accepissent.
Non denique communes belli casus recordabantur,
quam parvulae saepe causae vel falsae suspicionis vel terroris repentini vel
obiectae religionis magna detrimenta intulissent,
quotiens vel ducis vitio vel culpa tribuni in exercitu esset offensum;
sed, proinde ac si virtute vicissent,
neque ulla commutatio rerum posset accidere,
per orbem terrarum fama ac litteris victoriam eius diei concelebrabant.


These things added so much confidence and spirit to Pompey's men,
that they no longer thought about a plan of war, but seemed to have already won. 
They didn't realize that part of the cause had been the paucity of our soldiers,
or the unevenness of the ground and the confined approaches to the occupied
camp and the double-facing panic inside and outside the fortifications,
nor that the two parts of the army were cut off from each other,
so that one part was unable to aid the other.
To these things they weren't adding,
neither with a bitter attack waged, nor with a battle fought,
and they admitted to themselves that they had superior numbers, and
that the reversal was caused more by the confined approaches than by the enemy.
In short, the ordinary accidents of war aren't remembered,
what
how often of very small cause or of mistaken mistrust or of unexpected panic
or of opposing religion great defeats might have advanced,
as often as either by the fault of a leader or the blame of a tribune in the
army might be the offense;
but, hence and if they had conquered by courage/strength,
and no change of events were allowed to happen,
they made his victory of the day known through the world through rumor and letters.
