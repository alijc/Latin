73.1
Caesar a superioribus consiliis depulsus omnem sibi commutandam belli rationem existimavit.
Itaque uno tempore praesidiis omnibus deductis et oppugnatione dimissa coactoque
in unum locum exercitu contionem apud milites habuit hortatusque est,
ne ea, quae accidissent,
graviter ferrent neve his rebus terrerentur
multisque secundis proeliis unum adversum et id mediocre opponerent.
Habendam fortunae gratiam, quod Italiam sine aliquo vulnere cepissent,
quod duas Hispanias bellicosissimorum hominum peritissimis atque exercitatissimis ducibus pacavissent,
quod finitimas frumentariasque provincias in potestatem redegissent;
denique recordari debere, qua felicitate inter medias hostium classes oppletis non solum portibus,
sed etiam litoribus omnes incolumes essent transportati.
Si non omnia caderent secunda, fortunam esse industria sublevandam.
Quod esset acceptum detrimenti, cuiusvis potius quam suae culpae debere tribui.
Locum se aequum ad dimicandum dedisse,
potitum esse hostium castris, expulisse ac superasse pugnantes.
Sed sive ipsorum perturbatio sive error aliquis sive etiam fortuna
partam iam praesentemque victoriam interpellavisset,
dandam omnibus operam, ut acceptum incommodum virtute sarciretur.
Quod si esset factum, futurum, uti ad Gergoviam contigisset,
ut detrimentum in bonum verteret,
atque qui ante dimicare timuissent, ultro se proelio offerrent.


After Caesar was forced to abandon his most recent policies,
he reflected on each transformation of his battle plan.
And so he pulled back his forces and called off the assault at once,
and gathering the army into an assembly he passed among the the soldiers
and cheered them on, so that what had happened wouldn't bear on them too heavily
and to keep them from being frightened by these events,
so that, in the many battles to come, they'd oppose a single foe/direction?,
and that a minor one.
He told them that they'd have Fortune's favor,
because they'd taken Italia without any wound,
because they'd subdued the fierce men of Spain with the most experienced and
best trained leaders,
because they'd reduced the nearby grain-producing provinces into their power;
and finally, that they ought to remember, the good fortune that had
transported them safely between the halves of the enemy fleets, which had spread
over not only the harbors, but even the shores.
That, even if not everything that followed had gone well,
fortune would assist them through their hard work.
That what had been taken of loss/defeat, ought to be assigned
of whomever rather than to their own fault.
That they'd given even ground at the fighting,
that they'd gained possession of the enemy's camp,
and had driven out and defeated those fighting.
But whether their commotion or error to/by anyone or even fortune
had obstructed their already birthed and present victory,
the task would be given to all of them,
to redeem, through their courage, the inconvenience that they'd taken on.
If anything might be done, about to be, to make it to Gergovia,
to turn this defeat to the good,
and those who had previously been afraid to fight
might offer battle on the further side.
