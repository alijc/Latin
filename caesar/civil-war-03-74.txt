74.1 Hac habita contione nonnullos signiferos ignominia notavit
ac loco movit.  Exercitui quidem omni tantus incessit ex
incommodo dolor tantumque studium infamiae sarciendae, ut nemo
aut tribuni aut centurionis imperium desideraret, et sibi quisque
etiam poenae loco graviores imponeret labores, simulque omnes
arderent cupiditate pugnandi, cum superioris etiam ordinis
nonnulli ratione permoti manendum eo loco et rem proelio
committendam existimarent.  Contra ea Caesar neque satis
militibus perterritis confidebat spatiumque interponendum ad
recreandos animos putabat, et relictis munitionibus magnopere rei
frumentariae timebat.

After this meeting was over, he marked several standard bearers
with dishonor and removed them from their positions.  In truth,
such sorrow about the disaster assailed the whole army and such
zeal for making good the disgrace, that not one required the
command of either a tribune or a centurion, but each imposed even
heavier labors on himself in place of punishment, and at the same
time all of them burned with enthusiasm for fighting, while some
of the higher ranks, deeply moved by the account, proposed
staying put and deciding the matter in battle.  Caesar opposed
this, as he didn't have enough confidence in his fearful
soldiers, and was considering interposing an interval for
reviving their spirits, and, after abandoning their
fortifications, he had a great for for their food supplies.
