74.1
Hac habita contione nonnullos signiferos ignominia notavit ac loco movit.
Exercitui quidem omni tantus incessit ex incommodo dolor
tantumque studium infamiae sarciendae,
ut nemo aut tribuni aut centurionis imperium desideraret,
et sibi quisque etiam poenae loco graviores imponeret labores,
simulque omnes arderent cupiditate pugnandi,
cum superioris etiam ordinis nonnulli ratione permoti manendum eo loco
et rem proelio committendam existimarent.
Contra ea Caesar neque satis militibus perterritis confidebat
spatiumque interponendum ad recreandos animos putabat,
et relictis munitionibus magnopere rei frumentariae timebat.

After this meeting was held, he noted several standard bearers in disgrace
and moved to the place.
In truth, such sorrow about the disaster assailed the whole army
and such zeal for making good the disgrace,
that not one required the command of either a tribune or a centurion,
but each imposed even heavier labors on himself instead of punishment,
and at the same time all of them burned with enthusiasm for fighting,
while some of the higher ranks, deeply moved by the account,
considered staying put and deciding the matter in battle.
Facing these things, Caesar didn't have enough confidence in his fearful
soldiers, and was considering interposing an interval for reviving their
spirits, 
and to/by the rest of the fortifications greatly of/to the grain supply he was
fearing.
