75.1 Itaque nulla interposita mora sauciorum modo et aegrorum
habita ratione impedimenta omnia silentio prima nocte ex castris
Apolloniam praemisit.  Haec conquiescere ante iter confectum
vetuit.  His una legio missa praesidio est.  His explicitis rebus
duas in castris legiones retinuit, reliquas de quarta vigilia
compluribus portis eductas eodem itinere praemisit parvoque spatio
intermisso, ut et militare institutum servaretur, et quam serissime
eius profectio cognosceretur conclamari iussit statimque egressus
et novissimum agmen consecutus celeriter ex conspectu castrorum
discessit.  Neque vero Pompeius cognito consilio eius moram ullam
ad insequendum intulit; sed eodem spectans, si itinere impeditos
perterritos deprehendere posset, exercitum e castris eduxit
equitatumque praemisit ad novissimum agmen demorandum, neque
consequi potuit, quod multum expedito itinere antecesserat Caesar.
Sed cum ventum esset ad flumen Genusum, quod ripis erat impeditis,
consecutus equitatus novissimos proelio detinebat.  Huic suos
Caesar equites opposuit expeditosque antesignanos admiscuit CCCC;
qui tantum profecerunt, ut equestri proelio commisso pellerent
omnes compluresque interficerent ipsique incolumes se ad agmen
reciperent.

And so, without delay (save for dealing with the sick and wounded),
just after nightfall he quietly sent the whole baggage train
from the camp to Apollia, with
orders to take no rest on the way, and sending one legion along to
protect them.  After setting these things up he kept two legions in
camp, while the rest were led out from several gates in the fourth
watch and sent ahead on the same road and, after a short interval,
in keeping with military custom, ordered that the announcement of
his departure be put off as long as possible and following
immediately behind the rearmost column, quickly marched off out of
sight of the camp.  And, indeed, when Pompey learned of Caesar's
plan he made no delay in pursuing him; while at the same time
watching to see if he could make out the road clogged with
frightened men.  He led his army from camp and sent the cavalry
ahead to harry the rear of Caesar's columns, but couldn't catch
them up, because, since Caesar's army was marching without baggage,
it had had outrun its pursuers.  But when the army reached the
Genusus River, with its difficult banks, the cavalry caught up and
engaged the rearmost men in battle.  Caesar set his own horse
against these and added in 400 light infantrymen; who were so
effective that when they engaged Pompey's cavalry in battle they
drove them all off and killed many, and then betook themselves
safely back to their column.
