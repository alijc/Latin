76.1 Confecto iusto itinere eius diei Caesar traductoque exercitu flumen
Genusum veteribus suis in castris contra Asparagium consedit militesque
omnes intra vallum continuit equitatumque per causam pabulandi emissum
confestim decumana porta in castra se recipere iussit.
Simili ratione Pompeius confecto eius diei itinere in suis veteribus castris ad
Asparagium consedit.
Eius milites, quod ab opere integris munitionibus vacabant,
alii lignandi pabulandique causa longius progrediebantur,
alii, quod subito consilium profectionis ceperant magna parte
impedimentorum et sarcinarum relicta,
ad haec repetenda invitati propinquitate superiorum castrorum,
depositis in contubernio armis,
vallum relinquebant.
Quibus ad sequendum impeditis Caesar,
quod fore providerat,
meridiano fere tempore signo profectionis dato exercitum educit
duplicatoque eius diei itinere VIII milia passuum ex eo loco procedit;
quod facere Pompeius discessu militum non potuit.

When his normal day's march was completed
and the army had been led across the river Genusus,
Caesar bivouacked in his former camp opposite Asparagium
and secured all his soldiers within the wall.
He ordered the cavalry, which had been sent out in order to forage,
to immediately get themselves back into camp, using the rear gate.
With a similar plan, when Pompey's day's march was completed,
he bivouacked in his old camp at Asparagium.
Because his soldiers were fresh from not working on the  fortifications,
some advanced pretty far in order to collect firewood and forage,
others, because they suddenly seized on a plan of departing,
seeing that a great part of their baggage and packs had been left behind,
encouraged to return to these thing in the vicinity of their most recent camp,
after laying their arms down in their tents,
they abandoned their rampart.
Since they were hampered in their pursuit, Caesar,
since he'd forseen what was going to happen,
after a signal of departure had been given he led out the army just before midday
and advanced 8 miles from the place by duplicating his day's march;
because Pompey was unable to get his soldiers ready to march.
