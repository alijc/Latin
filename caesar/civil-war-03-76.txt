76.1 Confecto iusto itinere eius diei Caesar traductoque exercitu
flumen Genusum veteribus suis in castris contra Asparagium
consedit militesque omnes intra vallum continuit equitatumque per
causam pabulandi emissum confestim decumana porta in castra se
recipere iussit.  Simili ratione Pompeius confecto eius diei
itinere in suis veteribus castris ad Asparagium consedit.  Eius
milites, quod ab opere integris munitionibus vacabant, alii
lignandi pabulandique causa longius progrediebantur, alii, quod
subito consilium profectionis ceperant magna parte impedimentorum
et sarcinarum relicta, ad haec repetenda invitati propinquitate
superiorum castrorum, depositis in contubernio armis, vallum
relinquebant.  Quibus ad sequendum impeditis Caesar, quod fore
providerat, meridiano fere tempore signo profectionis dato
exercitum educit duplicatoque eius diei itinere VIII milia passuum
ex eo loco procedit; quod facere Pompeius discessu militum non
potuit.

When his full day's march was done and the army had been led
across the river Genusus, Caesar bivouacked in his former camp
opposite Asparagium and enclosed all his soldiers within the wall.
He ordered the cavalry, which had been sent out in order to
forage, to immediately get themselves back into camp, using the
rear gate.  With a similar plan, when Pompey's day's march was
completed, he bivouacked in his old camp at Asparagium.  Because
his soldiers were idle, having no work to do on the new
fortifications, some advanced pretty far in order to collect
firewood and forage, others, because they had marched out with no
notice and a great part of their baggage and packs had been left
behind, and were incited to reclaim these by the nearness of their
last camp, laid their arms down in their tents and abandoned their
rampart.  Since they were hampered in their pursuit, which Caesar
had forseen, after a signal for decamping had been given he led
out the army just before midday and advanced 8 miles from the
place, doubling his day's march; because Pompey was unable to get
his soldiers ready to march.
