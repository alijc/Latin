78.1 Caesari ad saucios deponendos,
stipendium exercitui dandum, socios confirmandos,
praesidium urbibus relinquendum necesse erat adire Apolloniam.
Sed his rebus tantum temporis tribuit, quantum erat properanti necesse;
timens Domitio, ne adventu Pompei praeoccuparetur,
ad eum omni celeritate et studio incitatus ferebatur.
Totius autem rei consilium his rationibus explicabat,
ut, si Pompeius eodem contenderet,
abductum illum a mari atque ab eis copiis, quas Dyrrachii comparaverat,
abstractum pari condicione belli secum decertare cogeret;
si in Italiam transiret,
coniuncto exercitu cum Domitio per Illyricum Italiae subsidio proficisceretur;
si Apolloniam Oricumque oppugnare et se omni maritima
ora excludere conaretur,
obsesso Scipione necessario illum suis auxilium ferre cogeret.
Itaque praemissis nuntiis ad Cn. Domitium Caesar ei scripsit et,
quid fieri vellet, ostendit,
praesidioque Apolloniae cohortibus IIII, Lissi I, III Orici relictis,
quique erant ex vulneribus aegri depositis,
per Epirum atque Athamaniam iter facere coepit.
Pompeius quoque de Caesaris consilio coniectura iudicans ad Scipionem
properandum sibi existimabat:
si Caesar iter illo haberet, ut subsidium Scipioni ferret;
si ab ora maritima Oricoque discedere nollet,
quod legiones equitatumque ex Italia exspectaret,
ipse ut omnibus copiis Domitium aggrederetur.


Caesar, in order to deposit his wounded,
pay his army their wages, secure allies,
and leave garrisons at the cities, needed to take Apollonia.
But however much time he allowed for these things,
he needed to hurry just as much;
fearing that Domitius,  aroused with anticipation for the arrival of Pompey,
would be carried to him with all speed and zeal.
But he explained his overall plan with these reasons,
that if Pompey strove for the same place, then he'd be drawn away from the sea
and from the troops that he'd collected at Dyrrachium,
which would force him to fight it out with himself
in an inadequate combat situation;
if he crossed over to Italy,
he'd join up with Domitius and set out by way of Illyricum to relieve Italy;
and if he attempted to attack Apolliania and Oricum
and cut him off from the entire coast,
he'd of necessity besiege Scipio and force him to carry help to his men.
And so Caesar sent messengers ahead to Gnaeus Domitius,
writing him and revealing what he wanted to be done,
and after leaving 4 cohorts, 1 of Lissus, 3 of Oricus, to defend Apolliania,
which were from wounds sick/infirm having deposited,
he set out on a march through Epirum and Athamania.
In the same way, Pompey threw a plan together, deciding about Caesar -
he thought to himself of hurrying to Scipio:
if Caesar passed a journey there, in order to bear relief to Scipio;
if he was unwilling to withdraw from the coast and Oricum,
because he was waiting for legions and an army from Italy,
so that he himself would attack Domitius with all his forces.
