79.1 His de causis uterque eorum celeritati studebat, et suis ut
esset auxilio, et ad opprimendos adversarios ne occasioni
temporis deesset.  Sed Caesarem Apollonia a directo itinere
averterat; Pompeius per Candaviam iter in Macedoniam expeditum
habebat.  Accessit etiam ex improviso aliud incommodum, quod
Domitius, qui dies complures castris Scipionis castra collata
habuisset, rei frumentariae causa ab eo discesserat et Heracliam,
quae est subiecta Candaviae, iter fecerat, ut ipsa fortuna illum
obicere Pompeio videretur.  Haec ad id tempus Caesar ignorabat.
Simul a Pompeio litteris per omnes provincias civitatesque
dimissis proelio ad Dyrrachium facto latius inflatiusque multo,
quam res erat gesta, fama percrebuerat, pulsum fugere Caesarem
paene omnibus copiis amissis; haec itinera infesta reddiderat,
haec civitates nonnullas ab eius amicitia avertebat.  Quibus
accidit rebus, ut pluribus dimissi itineribus a Caesare ad
Domitium et a Domitio ad Caesarem nulla ratione iter conficere
possent.  Sed Allobroges, Roucilli atque Aeci familiares, quos
perfugisse ad Pompeium demonstravimus, conspicati in itinere
exploratores Domitii, seu pristina sua consuetudine, quod una in
Gallia bella gesserant, seu gloria elati cuncta, ut erant acta,
exposuerunt et Caesaris profectionem et adventum Pompei
docuerunt.  A quibus Domitius certior factus vix IIII horarum
spatio antecedens hostium beneficio periculum vitavit et ad
Aeginium, quod est oppidum obiectum Thessaliae, Caesari venienti
occurrit.


For these reasons each of them was eager for speed, and  to get
aid to his own men and overwhelm his enemy, before he lost
a timely opportunity.  But while Caesar had diverted from his direct
march to reach Apollonia; Pompey held to his set route through
Candavia and into Macedonia.  Yet another setback occurred from
out of the blue, that Domitius, who'd kept his camp pitted
against Scipio's for many days, had withdrawn from him for the
sake of his grain supply, and had marched to Heraclia, which lies
near Candavia, so that fortune itself seemed to have cast him
into Pompey's path.  Caesar didn't know these things at the time.
Also, Pompey had sent off letters through all the provinces and
cities after the battle at Dyrrachium, and a greatly exagerated
rumor had spread far and wide, that Caesar had been driven off
and was in flight, after losing nearly all his forces.  This
rumor made the roads unsafe for Caesar, and turned some cities
away from their alliance with him.  And through these affairs it
happened that many times the men that Caesar sent to Domitius and
that Domitius sent to Caesar could on no account complete their
journey.  But when the Allobroges who followed Roucillus and
Aecus (who had deserted to Pompey, as we have recounted) saw
Domitius' scouts on the road, either from their former
fellowship, from serving together in the Gallic war, or altogher
carried away with boasting, they told them of both Caesar's
departure and Pompey's arrival.  When Domitius found this out
from them, with barely 4 hours grace, he evaded the danger by the
favor of the enemy and hurried to Aeginium, a town facing
Thessaly, to meet Caesar on his arrival.
