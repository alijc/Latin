80.1 Coniuncto exercitu Caesar Gomphos pervenit,
quod est oppidum primum Thessaliae venientibus ab Epiro;
quae gens paucis ante mensibus ultro ad Caesarem legatos miserat,
ut suis omnibus facultatibus uteretur,
praesidiumque ab eo militum petierat.
Sed eo fama iam praecurrerat, quam supra docuimus,
de proelio Dyrrachino, quod multis auxerat partibus.
Itaque Androsthenes, praetor Thessaliae,
cum se victoriae Pompei comitem esse mallet quam socium Caesaris in rebus adversis,
omnem ex agris multitudinem servorum ac liberorum in oppidum cogit portasque
praecludit et ad Scipionem Pompeiumque nuntios mittit, ut sibi subsidio veniant:
se confidere munitionibus oppidi, si celeriter succurratur;
longinquam oppugnationem sustinere non posse.
Scipio discessu exercituum ab Dyrrachio cognito Larisam legiones adduxerat;
Pompeius nondum Thessaliae appropinquabat.
Caesar castris munitis scalas musculosque ad repentinam
oppugnationem fieri et crates parari iussit.
Quibus rebus effectis cohortatus milites docuit,
quantum usum haberet ad sublevandam omnium rerum inopiam potiri oppido pleno atque opulento,
simul reliquis civitatibus huius urbis exemplo inferre terrorem et id fieri celeriter,
priusquam auxilia concurrerent.
Itaque usus singulari militum studio eodem, quo venerat,
die post horam nonam oppidum altissimis moenibus oppugnare aggressus ante solis
occasum expugnavit et ad diripiendum militibus concessit statimque ab oppido
castra movit et Metropolim venit,
sic ut nuntios expugnati oppidi famamque antecederet.


After the army was united Caesar reached Gomphos,
which is the first town in Thessaly when you come from Eprius;
whose residents had, only a few months before, freely sent envoys to Caesar,
that he might make use of all their resources,
while they had asked for a detachment of soldiers from him.
But the aforementioned rumor about the battle at Dyrrachium,
which had redoubled many times over, had already preceded him, 
And so Androsthenes, the praetor of Thessaly,
since he preferred to be a partner in Pompey's victory
than an ally of Caesar in unfavorable matters,
gathered great crowds of slaves and freedmen into town from the fields and
blocked the gates, and sent messengers to Scipio and Pompey,
asking them to come and relieve them:
that he was confident about the town's fortifications, if they were succurred in
short time;
but they could not sustain an assault of long duration.
Scipio, when informed of the withdrawl of the armies from Dyrrachium,
led his legions to Larisa;
Pompey was not yet near Thessaly.
After his camp was fortified, Caesar ordered ladders and mantelets to be made
and fascines to be prepared against a sudden assault.
And when these things wer accomplished, encouraged, he instructed the soldiers,
how much use he would have for alleviating their needs to obtain from
the fat and wealthy town,
also to the rest of the cities of this city by example to inflict
terror and it must be done quickly, before help could come running in.
And so, using the same remarkable zeal of the soldiers that he'd come with.
on that day after the ninth hour, having advanced to storm to the town with the
highest walls he attacked before sundown, and let his soldiers pillage it. 
And immediately shifted his camp away from the town and came to Metropolis,
to get there before the news of the town being assaulted.
