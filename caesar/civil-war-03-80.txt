80.1 Coniuncto exercitu Caesar Gomphos pervenit, quod est oppidum
primum Thessaliae venientibus ab Epiro; quae gens paucis ante
mensibus ultro ad Caesarem legatos miserat, ut suis omnibus
facultatibus uteretur, praesidiumque ab eo militum petierat.  Sed
eo fama iam praecurrerat, quam supra docuimus, de proelio
Dyrrachino, quod multis auxerat partibus.  Itaque Androsthenes,
praetor Thessaliae, cum se victoriae Pompei comitem esse mallet
quam socium Caesaris in rebus adversis, omnem ex agris
multitudinem servorum ac liberorum in oppidum cogit portasque
praecludit et ad Scipionem Pompeiumque nuntios mittit, ut sibi
subsidio veniant: se confidere munitionibus oppidi, si celeriter
succurratur; longinquam oppugnationem sustinere non posse.
Scipio discessu exercituum ab Dyrrachio cognito Larisam legiones
adduxerat; Pompeius nondum Thessaliae appropinquabat.  Caesar
castris munitis scalas musculosque ad repentinam oppugnationem
fieri et crates parari iussit.  Quibus rebus effectis cohortatus
milites docuit, quantum usum haberet ad sublevandam omnium rerum
inopiam potiri oppido pleno atque opulento, simul reliquis
civitatibus huius urbis exemplo inferre terrorem et id fieri
celeriter, priusquam auxilia concurrerent.  Itaque usus singulari
militum studio eodem, quo venerat, die post horam nonam oppidum
altissimis moenibus oppugnare aggressus ante solis occasum
expugnavit et ad diripiendum militibus concessit statimque ab
oppido castra movit et Metropolim venit, sic ut nuntios expugnati
oppidi famamque antecederet.


After the army was united Caesar reached Gomphos, which is the
first town in Thessaly as you come from Eprius; whose residents
had, only a few months before, freely sent envoys to Caesar, that
he might make use of all their resources, while they had asked
for a detachment of soldiers from him.  But the aforementioned
rumor about the battle at Dyrrachium, which had redoubled many
times over, had already preceded him.  And so Androsthenes, the
praetor of Thessaly, preferring to be a partner in Pompey's
victory than Caesar's ally in unfavorable matters, gathered great
crowds of slaves and freedmen into town from the fields and shut
the gates, and sent messengers to Scipio and Pompey, asking them
to come and relieve them: saying that he was confident about the
town's fortifications, if they were succurred in short time; but
they could not sustain a seige of long duration.  Scipio, when
informed of the withdrawl of the armies from Dyrrachium, led his
legions to Larisa; Pompey was not yet near Thessaly.  After his
camp was fortified, Caesar ordered ladders and mantelets to be
made and fascines to be prepared for a sudden assault.  And when
this was done, encouraged, he encouraged his soldiers, telling
them what a great opportunity was at hand for alleviating their
every want, by taking possession of the rich and wealthy town,
while at the same time terrorizing the other cities through the
example of this one.  And it must be done quickly, before help
could get to them.  And so, using the same remarkable zeal of the
soldiers that he'd come with, on the bext day at the ninth hour
he advanced to storm the high walls of the town, captured it
before sundown, and let his soldiers pillage it.  And then
immediately shifted his camp away from the town and came to
Metropolis, to get there before the news of the town's capture.
