81.1  Metropolitae primum eodem usi consilio isdem permoti rumoribus
portas clauserunt murosque armatis compleverunt;
sed postea casu civitatis Gomphensis cognito ex captivis,
quos Caesar ad murum producendos curaverat, portas aperuerunt.

Quibus diligentissime conservatis collata fortuna Metropolitum cum casu
Gomphensium nulla Thessaliae fuit civitas praeter Larisaeos,
qui magnis exercitibus Scipionis tenebantur,
quin Caesari parerent atque imperata facerent.

Ille idoneum locum in agris nactus,
<ad frumentorum commeatus> quae prope iam matura erant,
ibi adventum exspectare Pompei eoque omnem belli rationem conferre constituit.


At first at Metropolitus, swayed by the same advice and influenced
by the same rumors, they shut the gates and crowded the walls with armed men;
but later, after they learned of the fall of the city of Gomphensi from the
prisoners that Caesar had arranged to be led up to the wall,
they opened the gates.

and with these most carefully kept safe, fortune having been bestowed
>Metropolitus with the fall of Gomphensi no city of Thessaly was besides Larisa,
which was/were held by Scipio's great armies,
so that not to Caesar they might appear/obey and might make commands.

He, having obtained a suitable location in the fields,
