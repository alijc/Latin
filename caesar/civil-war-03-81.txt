81.1 Metropolitae primum eodem usi consilio isdem permoti rumoribus
portas clauserunt murosque armatis compleverunt; sed postea casu
civitatis Gomphensis cognito ex captivis, quos Caesar ad murum
producendos curaverat, portas aperuerunt.  Quibus diligentissime
conservatis collata fortuna Metropolitum cum casu Gomphensium nulla
Thessaliae fuit civitas praeter Larisaeos, qui magnis exercitibus
Scipionis tenebantur, quin Caesari parerent atque imperata facerent.
Ille idoneum locum in agris nactus, <ad frumentorum commeatus> quae
prope iam matura erant, ibi adventum exspectare Pompei eoque omnem
belli rationem conferre constituit.


At first the Metropolitans, swayed by the same advice and influenced
by the same rumors, shut the gates and crowded the walls with armed
men; but later, after they learned of the fall of the city of Gomphi
from the prisoners that Caesar had arranged to be led up to the
wall, they opened the gates.  And as these people were most
scrupulously spared, with their fortune compared with the fate of the
Gomphians, there was no city of Thessaly, except Larisa, which was held by
Scipio's great armies, that didn't submit to Caesar and accept his
commands.  After obtaining a suitable site in the fields for
provisions of grain which was already nearly ripe, he decided to
wait for Pompey's arrival there and to gather all his military operations
there.
