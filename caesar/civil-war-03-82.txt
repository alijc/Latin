82.1 Pompeius paucis post diebus in Thessaliam pervenit contionatusque
apud cunctum exercitum suis agit gratias, Scipionis milites cohortatur,
ut parta iam victoria praedae ac praemiorum velint esse participes,
receptisque omnibus in una castra legionibus suum cum Scipione honorem
partitur classicumque apud eum cani et alterum illi iubet praetorium tendi.
Auctis copiis Pompei duobusque magnis exercitibus coniunctis
pristina omnium confirmatur opinio, et spes victoriae augetur, adeo ut,
quicquid intercederet temporis, id morari reditum in Italiam videretur,
et si quando quid Pompeius tardius aut consideratius faceret,
unius esse negotium diei,
sed illum delectari imperio et consulares praetoriosque servorum habere numero dicerent.
Iamque inter se palam de praemiis ac de sacerdotiis contendebant
in annosque consulatum definiebant,
alii domos bonaque eorum, qui in castris erant Caesaris, petebant;
magnaque inter eos in consilio fuit controversia, oporteretne Lucili Hirri,
quod is a Pompeio ad Parthos missus esset,
proximis comitiis praetoriis absentis rationem haberi,
cum eius necessarii fidem implorarent Pompei,
praestaret, quod proficiscenti recepisset,
ne per eius auctoritatem deceptus videretur, reliqui,
in labore pari ac periculo ne unus omnes antecederet, recusarent.


After a few days Pompey reached Thessaly and addressed his entire army,
thanking his men. He urged Scipio's soldiers, with victory already gained,
to be willing to share the spoils and rewards,
and, with all the legions taken into a single camp,
he divvied his rewards up with Scipio and ordered a trumpet call to be sounded
in his presence and another to him his tent to be pitched. ??????
With Pompey's forces increased and the two large armies joined up,
everyone's former belief was confirmed, and the hope for victory increased,
to so much that,
whatever time interrupted, it seemed to delay their return to Italy,
and if Pompey ever did anything slowly or carefully,
that it was an annoyance of only a single day,
but they said that he was pleased by his command
and by the number of slaves of consular and praetorian rank that he held.
And now they were openly arguing over the reward and the priesthoods,
and were assigning the years of the consulships,
others asked for the houses and goods of men who were in Caesar's camp;
and there were great controversies between them in discussion,
it wouldn't be right for Lucilus Hirrius,
because he'd been sent to the Parthians by Pompey,
and would be away when the next pretorian elections would be held,
while his needs appealed to Pompey's good faith,
he might prevail, because he had undertaken his departure,
lest he seem deceived by his authority,
the remaining men objected,
in equal toil and peril lest a single one might get ahead of everyone else.
