83.1 Iam de sacerdotio Caesaris Domitius,
Scipio Spintherque Lentulus cotidianis contentionibus ad gravissimas verborum
contumelias palam descenderunt, cum Lentulus aetatis honorem ostentaret,
Domitius urbanam gratiam dignitatemque iactaret,
Scipio affinitate Pompei confideret.
Postulavit etiam L. Afranium proditionis exercitus Acutius Rufus apud Pompeium,
quod gestum in Hispania diceret.
Et L. Domitius in consilio dixit placere sibi bello confecto ternas tabellas dari ad iudicandum eis,
qui ordinis essent senatorii belloque una cum ipsis interfuissent,
sententiasque de singulis ferrent, qui Romae remansissent quique intra
praesidia Pompei fuissent neque operam in re militari praestitissent:
unam fore tabellam, qui liberandos omni periculo censerent;
alteram, qui capitis damnarent; tertiam, qui pecunia multarent.
Postremo omnes aut de honoribus suis aut de praemiis pecuniae aut de
persequendis inimicitiis agebant nec,
quibus rationibus superare possent,
sed, quemadmodum uti victoria deberent, cogitabant.


By now Domitius, Scipio and Spinther Lentulus,
in daily arguments about Caesar's priesthood,
openly stooped to the gravest verbal indignities -
when Lentulus pointed out his lifetime of honor,
Domitius threw out witty charm and esteem,
and Scipio relied on his kinship with Pompey.
Acutius Rufus even accused, in Pompey's presence,
L. Afranius of betrayal of the army,
which is what he called his actions in Spain.
And L. Domitius said in debate, that when the war was over,
he would be pleased to be given three tablets
to/at giving judgment to/by those
who of rank might be sentorial to/by war together with themselves might have
been between,
and they might tell their opinions about each of them,
those who had remained at Rome and who within the protection of Pompey had been
and not >work in military matters had excelled:
that the first tablet would be, all who might recommend freeing men from danger,
the second, those who condemned a person, the third, who extracted money as
forfeit.
Finally, everyone was pushing either their honors or their rewards or taking
vengeance on their enemies and not,
toby those reasons they could come out ahead,
but, in what way that they might owe by victory, they were considering.
