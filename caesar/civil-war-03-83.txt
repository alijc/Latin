83.1 Iam de sacerdotio Caesaris Domitius, Scipio Spintherque
Lentulus cotidianis contentionibus ad gravissimas verborum
contumelias palam descenderunt, cum Lentulus aetatis honorem
ostentaret, Domitius urbanam gratiam dignitatemque iactaret,
Scipio affinitate Pompei confideret.  Postulavit etiam
L. Afranium proditionis exercitus Acutius Rufus apud Pompeium,
quod gestum in Hispania diceret.  Et L. Domitius in consilio
dixit placere sibi bello confecto ternas tabellas dari ad
iudicandum eis, qui ordinis essent senatorii belloque una cum
ipsis interfuissent, sententiasque de singulis ferrent, qui Romae
remansissent quique intra praesidia Pompei fuissent neque operam
in re militari praestitissent: unam fore tabellam, qui liberandos
omni periculo censerent; alteram, qui capitis damnarent; tertiam,
qui pecunia multarent.  Postremo omnes aut de honoribus suis aut
de praemiis pecuniae aut de persequendis inimicitiis agebant nec,
quibus rationibus superare possent, sed, quemadmodum uti victoria
deberent, cogitabant.


Then Domitius, Scipio and Spinther Lentulus openly stooped to
the gravest verbal indignities in daily arguments over Caesar's
priestly office.  When Lentulus pointed out the honor of his age,
Domitius threw out his influence and authority with the city, and
Scipio relied on his kinship with Pompey.  Acutius Rufus even
accused, in Pompey's presence, L. Afranius of betrayal of the
army, which is what he called his actions in Spain.  And
L. Domitius said in debate, that when the war was over, it would
be meet for three ballots to be given to those who of sentorial
rank and who had stuck together with Pompey in the war, so that
they could pass sentence on each man who had stayed in Rome or
who had lived within Pompey's protection without serving in the
military: that the first ballot would be for freeing them from
all danger, the second for condemnation, and the third, a fine.
In the end, everyone was working for either their honors or their
rewards or taking vengeance on their enemies and weren't
considering the ways they could use to win the war, but rather,
in what way they should make use of their victory.
