84.1 Re frumentaria praeparata confirmatisque militibus et
satis longo spatio temporis a Dyrrachinis proeliis intermisso,
quo satis perspectum habere militum animum videretur,
temptandum Caesar existimavit,
quidnam Pompeius propositi aut voluntatis ad dimicandum haberet.
Itaque exercitum ex castris eduxit aciemque instruxit,
primum suis locis pauloque a castris Pompei longius,
continentibus vero diebus,
ut progrederetur a castris suis collibusque Pompeianis aciem subiceret.
Quae res in dies confirmatiorem eius exercitum efficiebat.
Superius tamen institutum in equitibus, quod demonstravimus, servabat,
ut, quoniam numero multis partibus esset inferior,
adulescentes atque expeditos ex antesignanis electis ad pernicitatem armis inter
equites proeliari iuberet,
qui cotidiana consuetudine usum quoque eius generis proeliorum perciperent.
His erat rebus effectum,
ut equitum mille etiam apertioribus locis VII milium Pompeianorum impetum,
cum adesset usus,
sustinere auderent neque magnopere eorum multitudine terrerentur.

Namque etiam per eos dies proelium secundum equestre fecit atque unum Allobrogem ex duobus,
quos perfugisse ad Pompeium supra docuimus, cum quibusdam interfecit.


When his provisions were prepared and his soldiers reinforced,
and when enough time had passed since the Dyrrachinian battles
that he seemed to have a good sense of the soldiers' spirit,
Caesar decided to test if Pompey had the will or means for combat.
And so he led the army out of camp and drew up his battle array,
at first with his positions a little way off from Pompey's camp,
over the course of the next days,
(day by day a little further)
to advance from his camp and expose his line to Pompey's high ground.
Which thing in day his confident army accomplished.
Nevertheless he was holding to a higher plan with regards his cavalry,
as we have shown, 
so that, since he was the inferior in number in many ways,
he ordered that young and lightly armed men from the lead troops,
selected for their agility with arms, fight among the horsemen,
who, through regular practice learned to make use of this sort of combat.
It was accomplished with these things,
so that a thousand horsemen yet to/by exposed places 7000 of Pompey's soldiers
>attack, when the skill was present,
they dared to support and not greatly by their great number were frightened.
for yet through the days the second cavalry battle he made
and >one Allobrogian out of two,
>those to have deserted to Pompey we have above pointed out,
with certain ones he killed.
