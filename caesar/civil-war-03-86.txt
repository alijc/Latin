86.1 Pompeius quoque, ut postea cognitum est, suorum omnium hortatu
statuerat proelio decertare. Namque etiam in consilio superioribus
diebus dixerat, priusquam concurrerent acies, fore uti exercitus
Caesaris pelleretur. Id cum essent plerique admirati, "scio me," inquit,
"paene incredibilem rem polliceri; sed rationem consilii mei accipite,
quo firmiore animo in proelium prodeatis. Persuasi equitibus nostris
(idque mihi facturos confirmaverunt), ut, cum propius sit accessum,
dextrum Caesaris cornu ab latere aperto aggrederentur et circumventa ab
tergo acie prius perturbatum exercitum pellerent, quam a nobis telum in
hostem iaceretur. Ita sine periculo legionum et paene sine vulnere
bellum conficiemus. Id autem difficile non est, cum tantum equitatu
valeamus." Simul denuntiavit, ut essent animo parati in posterum et,
quoniam fieret dimicandi potestas, ut saepe rogitavissent, ne suam neu
reliquorum opinionem fallerent.

Likewise, Pompey, as was later learned, had decided to fight a battle
in order to encourage all his men.
For indeed, already during the deliberation in recent days he had said,
before the lines engaged, that it would be that Caesar's army would be beaten.
When they had been surprised at this, he said,
"I know it is a pretty incredible thing that I promise;
but accept the reason for my plan,
by which you'll advance into battle with stauncher spirits.
I persuaded our calvary (and they proved it to me >about to make men),
that, when push came to shove,
Caesar's right wing could be attacked on its exposed flank
and with his battle line encircled from the rear
they'd defeat his line, thrown into confusion,
before one of our spears could be hurled.
Thus without danger to the legions and nearly without a wound we will end the war.
Now it is not difficult, since we are so strong in our cavalry."
At the same time he announced, that they'd be prepared in spirit into the
future and,
since an occasion for fighting might come up, as they had often asked,
that they shouldn't fail either his own opinion or that of the rest.
