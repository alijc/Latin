86.1 Pompeius quoque, ut postea cognitum est, suorum omnium hortatu
statuerat proelio decertare. Namque etiam in consilio superioribus
diebus dixerat, priusquam concurrerent acies, fore uti exercitus
Caesaris pelleretur. Id cum essent plerique admirati, "scio me," inquit,
"paene incredibilem rem polliceri; sed rationem consilii mei accipite,
quo firmiore animo in proelium prodeatis. Persuasi equitibus nostris
(idque mihi facturos confirmaverunt), ut, cum propius sit accessum,
dextrum Caesaris cornu ab latere aperto aggrederentur et circumventa ab
tergo acie prius perturbatum exercitum pellerent, quam a nobis telum in
hostem iaceretur. Ita sine periculo legionum et paene sine vulnere
bellum conficiemus. Id autem difficile non est, cum tantum equitatu
valeamus." Simul denuntiavit, ut essent animo parati in posterum et,
quoniam fieret dimicandi potestas, ut saepe rogitavissent, ne suam neu
reliquorum opinionem fallerent.

Likewise, Pompey, as was later learned, had decided to fight a battle
at the urging of all of his men.  For indeed, during deliberation in
recent days he had even said that Caesar's army would come be beaten
before the lines engaged.  When they had been surprised at this, he
said, "I know it is a pretty incredible thing that I promise; but
accept the reason for my plan, by which you'll advance into battle
with stauncher spirits.  I persuaded our calvary (and they confirmed
to me that they would so act), that, when the attack is at hand,
Caesar's right wing could be attacked on its exposed flank and with
his battle line encircled from the rear they'd defeat his line, thrown
into confusion, before one of our spears could be hurled.  Thus
without danger to the legions and nearly without a wound we will end
the war.  Now it is not difficult, since we are so strong in our
cavalry."  At the same time he ordered them to be prepared in spirit
for what was to come and, since a chance for fighting, that they'd
often desired, might occur, that they shouldn't fail either his own
opinion or that of the others.
