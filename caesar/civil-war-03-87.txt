87.1 Hunc Labienus excepit et, cum Caesaris copias despiceret,
Pompei consilium summis laudibus efferret, "noli," inquit,
"existimare, Pompei, hunc esse exercitum, qui Galliam
Germaniamque devicerit.  Omnibus interfui proeliis neque temere
incognitam rem pronuntio.  Perexigua pars illius exercitus
superest; magna pars deperiit, quod accidere tot proeliis fuit
necesse, multos autumni pestilentia in Italia consumpsit, multi
domum discesserunt, multi sunt relicti in continenti.  An non
audistis ex eis, qui per causam valetudinis remanserunt,
cohortes esse Brundisi factas?  Hae copiae, quas videtis, ex
dilectibus horum annorum in citeriore Gallia sunt refectae, et
plerique sunt ex coloniis Transpadanis.  Ac tamen quod fuit
roboris duobus proeliis Dyrrachinis interiit."  Haec cum
dixisset, iuravit se nisi victorem in castra non reversurum
reliquosque, ut idem facerent, hortatus est.  Hoc laudans
Pompeius idem iuravit; nec vero ex reliquis fuit quisquam, qui
iurare dubitaret.  Haec cum facta sunt in consilio, magna spe et
laetitia omnium discessum est; ac iam animo victoriam
praecipiebant, quod de re tanta et a tam perito imperatore nihil
frustra confirmari videbatur.


Labienus took this up and, after expressing contempt for
Caesar's forces, he set Pompey's plan forth with the loudest
praise, saying, "Don't suppose, Pompey, that this is the army
that subdued Gaul and Germany.  I took part in all the battles
and am not rashly relating an unproven thing.  Only a small part
of that army remains; a great portion was lost, since it was
nessary for so many to fall in battle, the autumn fever wasted
many men in Italy, many went home, and many were left on the
mainland.  Haven't you heard that the cohorts at Brundisium were
made up from those who stayed behind due to illness?  These
troops, you see, were recruited from levies of recent years on
the near side of Gaul, and most are from colonies beyond the Po.
And what yet remained of the flower of their troops was
destroyed in the two battles at Dyrrachini."  And after he said
this, he swore that he wouldn't return to camp unless victory
was gained, and urged the others to do the same.  Pompey,
praising this, swore the same; and truly there wasn't one of the
rest who hesitated to swear.  After these things were decided in
the council, they all dispersed with great hope and joy; and
they were already anticipating victory in their hearts, because
it seemed that nothing would be assured in vain about such a
thing and from such a skillful commander.
