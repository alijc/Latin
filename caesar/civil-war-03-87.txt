87.1 Hunc Labienus excepit et, cum Caesaris copias despiceret,
Pompei consilium summis laudibus efferret,
"noli," inquit, "existimare, Pompei, hunc esse exercitum,
qui Galliam Germaniamque devicerit.
Omnibus interfui proeliis neque temere incognitam rem pronuntio.
Perexigua pars illius exercitus superest;
magna pars deperiit, quod accidere tot proeliis fuit necesse,
multos autumni pestilentia in Italia consumpsit,
multi domum discesserunt, multi sunt relicti in continenti.
An non audistis ex eis, qui per causam valetudinis remanserunt,
cohortes esse Brundisi factas?
Hae copiae, quas videtis,
ex dilectibus horum annorum in citeriore Gallia sunt refectae,
et plerique sunt ex coloniis Transpadanis.
Ac tamen quod fuit roboris duobus proeliis Dyrrachinis interiit."
Haec cum dixisset,
iuravit se nisi victorem in castra non reversurum reliquosque,
ut idem facerent, hortatus est.
Hoc laudans Pompeius idem iuravit;
nec vero ex reliquis fuit quisquam, qui iurare dubitaret.
Haec cum facta sunt in consilio, magna spe et laetitia omnium discessum est;
ac iam animo victoriam praecipiebant,
quod de re tanta et a tam perito imperatore nihil frustra confirmari videbatur.


Labienus followed this and, since he expressed contempt for Caesar's forces,
he carried Pompey's plan out with the utmost approval, and said,
"Don't suppose, Pompey, that this is the army that subdued Gaul and Germany.
I took part in all the battles and am not rashly relating an unproven thing.
Only a small part of that army remains;
a great portion was lost, because it was nessary to destroy so many in battle,
the autumn fever wasted many men in Italy,
many went home, and many were left on the mainland.
Haven't you heard that, because of those who stayed behind due to illness,
cohorts were raised in Brundisium?
These troops, which you see, were rebuilt 
from levies of these years on the near side of Gaul.
And what yet remained of their military strength was ruined in the
two battles at Dyrrachini."
And after he said this,
he swore that he wouldn't return to camp unless victory was gained,
and urged the others to do the same.
Pompey, praising this, swore the same;
and not truly there wasn't one of the rest who hesitated to swear.
After these things were decided in the counsel,
it was dispersed with great hope and joy of all;
and they were already anticipating victory in their hearts,
because nothing seemed to be declared in vain
about such a thing and from such a skillful commander.
