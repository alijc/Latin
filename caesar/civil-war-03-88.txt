88.1 Caesar, cum Pompei castris appropinquasset,
ad hunc modum aciem eius instructam animadvertit.
Erant in sinistro cornu legiones duae traditae a Caesare initio dissensionis ex senatus consulto;
quarum una prima, altera tertia appellabatur.
In eo loco ipse erat Pompeius.
Mediam aciem Scipio cum legionibus Syriacis tenebat.
Ciliciensis legio coniuncta cum cohortibus Hispanis,
quas traductas ab Afranio docuimus, in dextro cornu erant collocatae.
Has firmissimas se habere Pompeius existimabat.
Reliquas inter aciem mediam cornuaque interiecerat
numeroque cohortes CX expleverat.
Haec erant milia XLV, evocatorum circiter duo,
quae ex beneficiariis superiorum exercituum ad eum convenerant;
quae tot acie disperserat.
Reliquas cohortes VII castris propinquisque castellis praesidio disposuerat.
Dextrum cornu eius rivus quidam impeditis ripis muniebat;
quam ob causam cunctum equitatum,
sagittarios funditoresque omnes sinistro cornu obiecerat.

Caesar, when he had gotten close to Pompey's camp,
observed that his line was prepared according to the following manner.
In the left wing were the two legions that had been surrendered by Caesar
at the beginning of the conflict by the decision of the senate;
one of these was called the First, and the other the Third.
In this position was Pompey.
Scipio held the middle of the line with the Syrian legions.
The legion of Cilicia, joined up with Spanish cohorts, that
we have shown were tranferred from Afranius, had been
assembled in the right wing.
Pompey judged that these were the staunchest troops he had.
He'd plugged the rest in between the middle of the line and the wings
and had filled it out to number 110 cohortes.
--------------
these were 45,000, of volunteers/veterans around two,
which things out of the bodyguards of the highest armies to him had assembled;
which things so many of/by the line he had dispersed.
---------------
He'd posted the remaining 7 cohorts in the camp and nearby towns as a garrison.
A stream was protecting his right wing with its inaccessible banks;
and because of this he'd thrown all of his calvary, archers and slingers
over to the left wing.
