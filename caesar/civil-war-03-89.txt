89.1 Caesar superius institutum servans decimam legionem in dextro
cornu, nonam in sinistro collocaverat, tametsi erat Dyrrachinis
proeliis vehementer attenuata, et huic sic adiunxit octavam, ut
paene unam ex duabus efficeret, atque alteram alteri praesidio
esse iusserat.  Cohortes in acie LXXX constitutas habebat, quae
summa erat milium XXII; cohortes VII castris praesidio reliquerat.
Sinistro cornu Antonium, dextro P. Sullam, media acie Cn. Domitium
praeposuerat.  Ipse contra Pompeium constitit.  Simul his rebus
animadversis, quas demonstravimus, timens, ne a multitudine
equitum dextrum cornu circumveniretur, celeriter ex tertia acie
singulas cohortes detraxit atque ex his quartam instituit
equitatuique opposuit et, quid fieri vellet, ostendit monuitque
eius diei victoriam in earum cohortium virtute constare.  Simul
tertiae aciei totique exercitui imperavit, ne iniussu suo
concurreret: se, cum id fieri vellet, vexillo signum daturum.


Caesar, keeping to his previous plan, positioned the tenth legion
on the right wing and the ninth, even though it had been severely
thinned out by the Dyrrachinian battles, on the left.  He attached
the eighth legion to it, to make, in a way, a single legion out of
two, and had commanded that each should relieve the other.  He had
80 cohorts set up in the battle line, adding up to 22 thousand
men, and had left 7 cohorts in camp to protect it.  He'd placed
Antony in command of the left wing, P. Sulla on the right, and
Gnaeus Domitius in the center, while he himself took up a position
facing Pompey.  Meanwhile, after seeing to the matters that we
have described, fearing that the right wing might be encircled by
a large number of horse, he rapidly drew several cohorts out of
the third rank and created a fourth from these, positioned them
facing the cavalry and showed them what he wanted to happen, and
admonished them to courageously stand firm in their cohorts for
this day's victory.  At the same time he ordered the third rank
and the whole army to not engage in combat without his orders: he
himself, when he wished it to happen, would give the signal.
