89.1 Caesar superius institutum servans decimam legionem in dextro cornu,
nonam in sinistro collocaverat, tametsi erat Dyrrachinis proeliis vehementer attenuata,
et huic sic adiunxit octavam, ut paene unam ex duabus efficeret,
atque alteram alteri praesidio esse iusserat.
Cohortes in acie LXXX constitutas habebat, quae summa erat milium XXII;
cohortes VII castris praesidio reliquerat.
Sinistro cornu Antonium, dextro P. Sullam, media acie Cn. Domitium praeposuerat.
Ipse contra Pompeium constitit.
Simul his rebus animadversis, quas demonstravimus, timens,
ne a multitudine equitum dextrum cornu circumveniretur,
celeriter ex tertia acie singulas cohortes detraxit
atque ex his quartam instituit equitatuique opposuit et,
quid fieri vellet,
ostendit monuitque eius diei victoriam in earum cohortium virtute constare.

Simul tertiae aciei totique exercitui imperavit, ne iniussu suo concurreret:
se, cum id fieri vellet, vexillo signum daturum.


Caesar, keeping to his previous plan, positioned the tenth legion on the right
wing and the ninth on the left, even though it had been severely thinned out by
the Dyrrachinian battles.
He attached the eighth legion to this one, to make, nearly, a single legion out
of two, and had commanded that one should be the aid to the other.
He had 80 cohorts set up in the battle line,
which the best/highest was 22 thousand;
he'd left 7 cohorts in camp to protect it.
He'd placed Antony in command of the left wing, P. Sulla on the right,
and Gnaeus Domitius in the center.
He himself took up a position facing Pompey.

At the same time, these things having been observed, we have shown what,
fearing lest by a mob of horse the right wing might be encircled,
rapidly out of the third rank >several cohorts he drew out
and from these created a fourth and to cavalry placed opposite and,
what he might wish to happen,
he showed and warned of/to his day >victory in their of cohorts courage to stand
firm.

at the same time to the third rank and to the whole army he commanded,
lest unbidden/without orders to/by his it might charge:
self, when he wished it to happen, would give the signal...
