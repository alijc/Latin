90.1 Exercitum cum militari more ad pugnam cohortaretur suaque in
eum perpetui temporis officia praedicaret, imprimis commemoravit:
testibus se militibus uti posse, quanto studio pacem petisset;
quae per Vatinium in colloquiis, quae per Aulum Clodium eum
Scipione egisset, quibus modis ad Oricum cum Libone de mittendis
legatis contendisset.  Neque se umquam abuti militum sanguine
neque rem publicam alterutro exercitu privare voluisse.  Hac
habita oratione exposcentibus militibus et studio pugnae
ardentibus tuba signum dedit.


When he was exhorting the army to battle, as per military custom,
and was proclaiming their obligations to him on all occasions, he
especially mentioned: that he could use his soldiers as witnesses
to the great zeal with which he had sought peace; which he
had done, negotiating through Vatinius, and through Aulus
Clodius to Scipio, in the ways that he had contended at Oricum
with Libo about sending envoys.  That he had never wanted to
squander the blood of soldiers, or to deprive the republic of either
of its armies.  After uttering this speech, he had a trumpet
signal sounded to the soldiers, who demanded, and were ablaze
with zeal for battle.
