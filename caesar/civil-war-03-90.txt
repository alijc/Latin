90.1 Exercitum cum militari more ad pugnam cohortaretur suaque in eum
perpetui temporis officia praedicaret, imprimis commemoravit:
testibus se militibus uti posse, quanto studio pacem petisset;
quae per Vatinium in colloquiis, quae per Aulum Clodium eum Scipione egisset,
quibus modis ad Oricum cum Libone de mittendis legatis contendisset.
Neque se umquam abuti militum sanguine neque rem publicam alterutro exercitu
privare voluisse.
Hac habita oratione exposcentibus militibus et studio pugnae
ardentibus tuba signum dedit.


After he exhorted the army to battle in a military manner
and declared his own obligations of the entire time in it,
he especially mentioned:
that he could use his soldiers as witnesses to the great zeal with which
he had sought peace;
which which he had done, negotiating through Vatinius,
which through Aulus Clodius >him to/by Scipio,
in the ways that he had striven about sending envoys to Oricus with Libo.
That he had never wanted to squander the blood of soldiers,
or to deprive the republic of either army.
With this speech having been held,
he gave the signal with a trumpet to the soldiers,
who demanded, and were ablaze with zeal for battle.
