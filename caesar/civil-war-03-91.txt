91.1 Erat C. Crastinus evocatus in exercitu Caesaris, qui superiore anno
apud eum primum pilum in legione X duxerat, vir singulari virtute. Hic
signo dato, "sequimini me," inquit, "manipulares mei qui fuistis, et
vestro imperatori quam constituistis operam date. Unum hoc proelium
superest; quo confecto et ille suam dignitatem et nos nostram libertatem
recuperabimus." Simul respiciens Caesarem, "faciam," inquit, "hodie,
imperator, ut aut vivo mihi aut mortuo gratias agas." Haec cum dixisset,
primus ex dextro cornu procucurrit, atque eum electi milites circiter
CXX voluntarii eiusdem cohortis sunt prosecuti.

C. Crastinus was a volunteer in Caesar's army,
who in the previous year had commanded his first javelin in the 10th Legion,
a man of singular courage.
When the signal was given, he said, "You who were in my maniple, follow me!
and pay attention to your general in what you have resolved.
This single battle is left; when it's over he'll regain his dignity and 
us our liberty."
And while gazing at Caesar, he said, "I'll act today, general,
so that you'll thank me, either alive or dead."
After saying this, he was the first to run out ahead from the left wing,
and picked soldiers, around 120 volunteers of his own cohort followed him.
