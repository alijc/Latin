93.1 Sed nostri milites dato signo cum infestis pilis procucurrissent
atque animum advertissent non concurri a Pompeianis, usu periti ac
superioribus pugnis exercitati sua sponte cursum represserunt et ad
medium fere spatium constiterunt, ne consumptis viribus
appropinquarent, parvoque intermisso temporis spatio ac rursus
renovato cursu pila miserunt celeriterque, ut erat praeceptum a
Caesare, gladios strinxerunt.  Neque vero Pompeiani huic rei
defuerunt.  Nam et tela missa exceperunt et impetum legionum tulerunt
et ordines suos servarunt pilisque missis ad gladios redierunt.
Eodem tempore equites ab sinistro Pompei cornu, ut erat imperatum,
universi procucurrerunt, omnisque multitudo sagittariorum se
profudit.  Quorum impetum noster equitatus non tulit, sed paulatim
loco motus cessit, equitesque Pompei hoc acrius instare et se
turmatim explicare aciemque nostram a latere aperto circumire
coeperunt.  Quod ubi Caesar animadvertit, quartae aciei, quam
instituerat sex cohortium, dedit signum.  Illi celeriter
procucurrerunt infestisque signis tanta vi in Pompei equites impetum
fecerunt, ut eorum nemo consisteret, omnesque conversi non solum loco
excederent, sed protinus incitati fuga montes altissimos peterent.
Quibus submotis omnes sagittarii funditoresque destituti inermes sine
praesidio interfecti sunt.  Eodem impetu cohortes sinistrum cornu
pugnantibus etiam tum ac resistentibus in acie Pompeianis
circumierunt eosque a tergo sunt adorti.


But, when the signal was given, after our soldiers had advanced with
raised javelins and had taken heed that they weren't charged by
Pompey's men, skilled with experience and practiced from earlier
battles, of their own free will they checked their charge and halted
about midway to keep from approaching with exhausted strength.  They
paused for a short time and then renewed their charge again, they
hurled their javelins and quickly, as had been ordered by Caesar,
drew their swords.  And, indeed, Pompey's men were not lacking in
this regard.  For they both warded off the hurled spears and bore the
legions' attack.  They kept their ranks and after hurling their
javelins turned to their swords.  At the same time the calvary from
Pompey's left wing, as had been ordered, all raced forward, and the
whole mass of archers poured out.  And our calvary couldn't bear that
assault, but, dislodged from their position, gradually retreated, and
at this Pompey's horse commenced to pursue more fiercely, to extend
themselves by squadrons, and to encircle our line from its exposed
flank.  And when Caesar took heed of this, he gave the signal to the
fourth line, the one that he'd assembled out of six cohorts.  They
quickly advanced and with standards at the ready effected a charge
into Pompey's horse with such force that none of them stood firm, and
not only were they all swept away from their position and withdrew,
but they at once fled for the highest mountains at a full gallop.
And after these were driven off, all the archers and slingers,
deserted and defenseless with no protection, were killed.  In the
same attack the cohorts encircled the left wing, where Pompey's men
were still fighting and standing firm in their line and attacked them
from behind.
