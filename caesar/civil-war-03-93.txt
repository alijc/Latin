93.1 Sed nostri milites dato signo cum infestis pilis procucurrissent
atque animum advertissent non concurri a Pompeianis,
usu periti ac superioribus pugnis exercitati sua sponte cursum represserunt
et ad medium fere spatium constiterunt, ne consumptis viribus appropinquarent,
parvoque intermisso temporis spatio ac rursus renovato cursu pila
miserunt celeriterque, ut erat praeceptum a Caesare, gladios strinxerunt.
Neque vero Pompeiani huic rei defuerunt.
Nam et tela missa exceperunt et impetum legionum tulerunt
et ordines suos servarunt pilisque missis ad gladios redierunt.
Eodem tempore equites ab sinistro Pompei cornu, ut erat imperatum,
universi procucurrerunt, omnisque multitudo sagittariorum se profudit.
Quorum impetum noster equitatus non tulit, sed paulatim loco motus cessit,
equitesque Pompei hoc acrius instare et se turmatim explicare
aciemque nostram a latere aperto circumire coeperunt.
Quod ubi Caesar animadvertit, quartae aciei, quam instituerat sex cohortium, dedit signum.
Illi celeriter procucurrerunt infestisque signis tanta vi in Pompei equites
impetum fecerunt, ut eorum nemo consisteret,
omnesque conversi non solum loco excederent,
sed protinus incitati fuga montes altissimos peterent.
Quibus submotis omnes sagittarii funditoresque
destituti inermes sine praesidio interfecti sunt.
Eodem impetu cohortes sinistrum cornu pugnantibus etiam tum ac
resistentibus in acie Pompeianis circumierunt eosque a tergo sunt adorti.


But after our soldiers had advanced with hostile javelins when the signal was
given, and had taken heart when they weren't charged by Pompey's men,
skilled with experience and practiced from earlier battles
of their own free will they repressed the charge
and halted at nearly the middle of the space 
to keep from approaching with exhausted strength,
they paused for a short time and once restored again
they cast their javelins with more force in their charge,
as had been ordered by Caesar, and drew their swords. 
And, indeed, Pompey's men were not lacking in this.
For they both warded off the hurled spears and bore the legions' attack.
They kept their ranks and responded to the swords with hurled javelins.
At the same time the calvary from Pompey's left wing, as had been ordered,
all raced forward, and the whole mass of archers poured out.
And our calvary couldn't bear that assault, but,
dislodged from their position, gradually retreated,
and at this Pompey's horse commenced to pursue more fiercely,
to extend themselves by squadrons,
and to encircle our line from its exposed flank.
And when Caesar noticed this, he gave the signal to the fourth line,
which he had made up out of six cohorts.
They quickly advanced and with hostile standards effected a charge into
Pompey's horse with such force, that not one of them stood firm,
and not only were they all swept away from their position and withdrew,
but they at once fled for the highest mountains at a full gallop.
And with these driven off, all the archers and slingers, deserted and
defenseless with no protection, were killed.
In the same attack cohorts surrounded the left wing,
with Pompey's men still moreover fighting and making a stand in their line
and they were attacked from behind.
