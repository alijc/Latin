94.1 Eodem tempore tertiam aciem Caesar, quae quieta fuerat et se ad id
tempus loco tenuerat, procurrere iussit. Ita cum recentes atque integri
defessis successissent, alii autem a tergo adorirentur, sustinere
Pompeiani non potuerunt, atque universi terga verterunt. Neque vero
Caesarem fefellit, quin ab eis cohortibus, quae contra equitatum in
quarta acie collocatae essent, initium victoriae oriretur, ut ipse in
cohortandis militibus pronuntiaverat. Ab his enim primum equitatus est
pulsus, ab isdem factae caedes sagittariorum ac funditorum, ab isdem
acies Pompeiana a sinistra parte circumita atque initium fugae factum.
Sed Pompeius, ut equitatum suum pulsum vidit atque eam partem, cui
maxime confidebat, perterritam animadvertit, aliis quoque diffisus acie
excessit protinusque se in castra equo contulit et eis centurionibus,
quos in statione ad praetoriam portam posuerat, clare, ut milites
exaudirent, "tuemini," inquit, "castra et defendite diligenter, si quid
durius acciderit. Ego reliquas portas circumeo et castrorum praesidia
confirmo." Haec cum dixisset, se in praetorium contulit summae rei
diffidens et tamen eventum exspectans.


At the same time Caesar ordered his third line, which had been out of
the action and had stayed in position up to that time, into the fray.
Thus, as fresh and rested men advanced on exhausted ones while others
attacked from behind, Pompey's men could not hold their ground, and
they all turned tail.  And indeed, Caesar was not mistaken when he'd
proclaimed in exhorting the soldiers, that it was in fact from the
cohorts that were positioned in the fourth line facing the cavalry that
the first inkling of victory would be born.  For it was by these that
the cavalry was repulsed at the first, by the same was accomplished the
slaughter of the archers and slingers, by these same lines was Pompey's
left flank encircled and the beginnings of flight produced.  Now when
Pompey saw that his cavalry had been defeated and observed that the
part that he especially relied upon had panicked, despairing of the
others as well, he withdrew from the line and rode straight into camp.
And he told the centurions whom he'd posted on watch at the front gate,
distinctly, so that soldiers heard him clearly, "Protect the camp and
defend it diligently, if the worst should happen.  I'm going round the
other gates and will shore up the camp's garrisons."  After he said
this, he went into his tent, lacking confidence in the chief matter,
and yet awaiting events.
