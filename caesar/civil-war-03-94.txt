94.1 Eodem tempore tertiam aciem Caesar, quae quieta fuerat et se ad id
tempus loco tenuerat, procurrere iussit. Ita cum recentes atque integri
defessis successissent, alii autem a tergo adorirentur, sustinere
Pompeiani non potuerunt, atque universi terga verterunt. Neque vero
Caesarem fefellit, quin ab eis cohortibus, quae contra equitatum in
quarta acie collocatae essent, initium victoriae oriretur, ut ipse in
cohortandis militibus pronuntiaverat. Ab his enim primum equitatus est
pulsus, ab isdem factae caedes sagittariorum ac funditorum, ab isdem
acies Pompeiana a sinistra parte circumita atque initium fugae factum.
Sed Pompeius, ut equitatum suum pulsum vidit atque eam partem, cui
maxime confidebat, perterritam animadvertit, aliis quoque diffisus acie
excessit protinusque se in castra equo contulit et eis centurionibus,
quos in statione ad praetoriam portam posuerat, clare, ut milites
exaudirent, "tuemini," inquit, "castra et defendite diligenter, si quid
durius acciderit. Ego reliquas portas circumeo et castrorum praesidia
confirmo." Haec cum dixisset, se in praetorium contulit summae rei
diffidens et tamen eventum exspectans.


At the same time Caesar ordered the third line,
which had been out of the action and had stayed in position up to that time,
to charge.
Thus, after the fresh and rested men followed the exhausted ones,
while others attacked from behind,
Pompey's men could not hold their ground, and they all turned tail.
And indeed it didn't disappoint Caesar, in fact it was from the cohorts
that had been positioned in the fourth line facing the cavalry
that the first inkling of victory was born,
as he himself had proclaimed when exhorting the soldiers.
For it was by these that the cavalry was repulsed at the first,
by the same was done the slaughter of the archers and slingers,
by these same lines was Pompey's left flank encircled
and the beginnings of flight produced.
But when Pompey saw that his cavalry had been defeated and
observed that the part that he especially relied upon was in panic,
with the others likewise in despair he retired from the front line
and conveyed himself into camp on horseback.
And he told the centurions whom he'd posted on watch at the front gate,
distinctly, so that soldiers heard him clearly,
"Protect the camp and defend it diligently, if anything nasty comes up.
I'm wandering around the gates and reassure the camp garrison."
After he said this, he conveyed himself in the front gate,
despairing of the utmost business and yet hoping for success.
