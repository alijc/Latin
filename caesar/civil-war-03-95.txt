95.1 Caesar Pompeianis ex fuga intra vallum compulsis nullum spatium
perterritis dari oportere existimans milites cohortatus est,
ut beneficio fortunae uterentur castraque oppugnarent.
Qui, etsi magno aestu fatigati (nam ad meridiem res erat perducta),
tamen ad omnem laborem animo parati imperio paruerunt.
Castra a cohortibus, quae ibi praesidio erant relictae, industrie defendebantur,
multo etiam acrius a Thracibus barbarisque auxiliis.
Nam qui acie refugerant milites, et animo perterriti et lassitudine confecti,
missis plerique armis signisque militaribus,
magis de reliqua fuga quam de castrorum defensione cogitabant.
Neque vero diutius, qui in vallo constiterant,
multitudinem telorum sustinere potuerunt,
sed confecti vulneribus locum reliquerunt,
protinusque omnes ducibus usi centurionibus tribunisque militum in altissimos montes,
qui ad castra pertinebant, confugerunt.


When Pompey's troops had been driven into their rampart in their flight,
Caesar exhorted his soldiers, thinking to order the panicked men to be given 
no room, in order to make use of fortune's favor and attack the camp.
And they, although wearied with great agitation
(for the battle had been prolonged up to midday),
they nevertheless readily obeyed the order for each task with spirit.
The camp was vigorously defended by the cohorts that had been left there as a
garrison, and even more bitterly by the Thracians and barbarian auxiliaries.
For those soldiers who had fled from the front line,
and terrified at heart and done in by fatigue,
with most of their arms and military standards thrown away,
were thinking more about continuing thier flight than about defending the camp.
And indeed, those who had made a stand inside the rampart
could no longer sustain a great number of weapons, 
but, done in by their wounds, abandoned their position,
and at once everyone who reached the camp,
having made use of commanders, centurions and military tribunes,
fled into the highest mountains.
