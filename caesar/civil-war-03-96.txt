96.1 In castris Pompei videre licuit trichilas structas,
magnum argenti pondus expositum, recentibus caespitibus tabernacula constrata,
Lucii etiam Lentuli et nonnullorum tabernacula protecta edera,
multaque praeterea, quae nimiam luxuriam et victoriae fiduciam designarent,
ut facile existimari posset nihil eos de eventu eius diei timuisse,
qui non necessarias conquirerent voluptates.
At hi miserrimo ac patientissimo exercitui Caesaris luxuriam obiciebant,
cui semper omnia ad necessarium usum defuissent.
Pompeius, iam cum intra vallum nostri versarentur,
equum nactus, detractis insignibus imperatoris,
decumana porta se ex castris eiecit protinusque equo citato Larisam contendit.
Neque ibi constitit, sed eadem celeritate, paucos suos ex fuga nactus,
nocturno itinere non intermisso,
comitatu equitum XXX ad mare pervenit navemque frumentariam conscendit,
saepe, ut dicebatur, querens tantum se opinionem fefellisse,
ut, a quo genere hominum victoriam sperasset,
ab eo initio fugae facto paene proditus videretur.


In Pompey's camp one could see arbors built up,
a great weight of silver abandoned, tents covered with fresh turf,
the tents of Lucius and also Lentulus and a few others covered with ???,
and many things in addition,
which indicated overly great luxury and confidence in victory,
so that it easily could be supposed that
those who sought out unnecessary delights
feared nothing from the outcome of the day.
But they cast this luxury in the teeth of Caesar's miserable and long-suffering
army, for which all the essentials had always been wanting.
Pompey, whlie our men were already moving about within the ramparts,
got his hands on a horse, pulled off his general's insignia,
and flung himself out of camp by the rear gate and made for Larissa,
spurring his horse all the way.
And he didn't stop there, but having met up with a few of his men from the rout,
with the same dispatch on an uninterrupted night journey,
reached the sea in the company of 300 horse and boarded a supply ship,
often, as was said, grumbling that his belief had so badly deceived him,
so that, by which race of man he had hoped for victory,
from the beginning of flight done nearly he was seen to have been betrayed.
