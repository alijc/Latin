96.1 In castris Pompei videre licuit trichilas structas, magnum
argenti pondus expositum, recentibus caespitibus tabernacula
constrata, Lucii etiam Lentuli et nonnullorum tabernacula protecta
hedera, multaque praeterea, quae nimiam luxuriam et victoriae
fiduciam designarent, ut facile existimari posset nihil eos de
eventu eius diei timuisse, qui non necessarias conquirerent
voluptates.  At hi miserrimo ac patientissimo exercitui Caesaris
luxuriam obiciebant, cui semper omnia ad necessarium usum
defuissent.  Pompeius, iam cum intra vallum nostri versarentur,
equum nactus, detractis insignibus imperatoris, decumana porta se
ex castris eiecit protinusque equo citato Larisam contendit.  Neque
ibi constitit, sed eadem celeritate, paucos suos ex fuga nactus,
nocturno itinere non intermisso, comitatu equitum XXX ad mare
pervenit navemque frumentariam conscendit, saepe, ut dicebatur,
querens tantum se opinionem fefellisse, ut, a quo genere hominum
victoriam sperasset, ab eo initio fugae facto paene proditus
videretur.


In Pompey's camp one could see arbors erected, a great weight of
abandoned silver, huts covered with fresh turf, the tents of Lucius
and also Lentulus and a few others covered with ivy, and many other
things that indicated excessive luxury and confidence in victory,
so that it could easily be supposed that those who sought out
delights and not necessities feared nothing from the outcome of the
day.  But they cast this luxury in the teeth of Caesar's miserable
and long-suffering army, for whom all the essentials had always
been wanting.  Pompey, while our men were already moving about
within the ramparts, got his hands on a horse, pulled off his
general's insignia, and flung himself out of camp by the rear gate
and made for Larissa, spurring his horse all the way.  And he
didn't stop there, but snatched up a few of his men from the rout,
and without slowing down rode throught the night, reached the sea
with an escort of 30 horse and boarded a supply ship, often, as it
was said, grumbling that his judgment had badly deceived him, so
that he almost seemed betrayed, because the men that he had hoped
would give him victory had fled from the first.
