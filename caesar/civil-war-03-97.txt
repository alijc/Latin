97.1 Caesar castris potitus a militibus contendit, ne in praeda
occupati reliqui negotii gerendi facultatem dimitterent.  Qua re
impetrata montem opere circummunire instituit.  Pompeiani, quod is
mons erat sine aqua, diffisi ei loco relicto monte universi iugis
eius Larisam versus se recipere coeperunt.  Qua re animadversa Caesar
copias suas divisit partemque legionum in castris Pompei remanere
iussit, partem in sua castra remisit, IIII secum legiones duxit
commodioreque itinere Pompeianis occurrere coepit et progressus milia
passuum VI aciem instruxit.  Qua re animadversa Pompeiani in quodam
monte constiterunt.  Hunc montem flumen subluebat.  Caesar milites
cohortatus, etsi totius diei continenti labore erant confecti noxque
iam suberat, tamen munitione flumen a monte seclusit, ne noctu aquari
Pompeiani possent.  Quo perfecto opere illi de deditione missis
legatis agere coeperunt.  Pauci ordinis senatorii, qui se cum eis
coniunxerant, nocte fuga salutem petiverunt.


After capturing the camp Caesar entreated his soldiers not to give up
the opportunity for carrying out the rest of the business by wasting
time in looting.  And after he achieved this he set about hemming the
mountain in with a fortification.  Pompey's men, in despair because
the mountain had no water, abandoned their position and all together
commenced to shift themselves towards Larisa.  And when Caesar
noticed this, he divided his forces; he ordered a portion of his
legions to remain in Pompey's camp, sent a portion back to his own
camp, and took 4 legions with him and marched off to intercept
Pompey's forces, using a better road, and after advancing 6 miles,
drew up his battle line.  When Pompey's men caught wind of this, they
made a stand on a mountain.  A stream flowed past the base of this
mountain.  After Caesar exhorted his soldiers, even though they had
been consumed with continuous toil all day and night was already
nigh, nevertheless he cut the stream off from the mountain with a
fortification, to keep Pompey's troops from being able to fetch water
in the night.  And after this was done they set about sending envoys
to negotiate a surrender.  A few men of senatorial rank who had
joined up with them made for safety in flight in the night.
