98.1 Caesar prima luce omnes eos, qui in monte consederant,
ex superioribus locis in planitiem descendere atque arma proicere iussit.
Quod ubi sine recusatione fecerunt passisque palmis proiecti ad terram
flentes ab eo salutem petiverunt, consolatus consurgere iussit et pauca
apud eos de lenitate sua locutus, quo minore essent timore, omnes
conservavit militibusque suis commendavit, ne qui eorum violaretur, neu
quid sui desiderarent.

Hac adhibita diligentia ex castris sibi legiones alias occurrere et eas,
quas secum duxerat,
in vicem requiescere atque in castra reverti iussit eodemque die Larisam pervenit.


At first light, Caesar ordered everyone who had bivouacked on the mountain
to come down from the heights to the plain and throw down their arms.
Which they did at once, without balking,
and throwing themselves on the ground with outstretched hands, weeping,
begged for safety from him.
Soothed, he ordered them to get up,
and after speaking a few words about his leniency in their presence,
to lessen their fear, he spared them all and 
   to/by his soldiers entrusted,
   lest he who dishonored them,
   and not what of his they might wish for.
After this diligence was applied, the legions rushed out of camp to meet
other legions, and those, which he had brought with him,
he ordered to rest in turn and having returned to camp on the same day reached Larisa.
