99.1 In eo proelio non amplius CC milites desideravit, sed centuriones,
fortes viros, circiter XXX amisit.
Interfectus est etiam fortissime pugnans Crastinus,
cuius mentionem supra fecimus, gladio in os adversum coniecto.
Neque id fuit falsum, quod ille in pugnam proficiscens dixerat.
Sic enim Caesar existimabat, eo proelio excellentissimam
virtutem Crastini fuisse, optimeque eum de se meritum iudicabat.
Ex Pompeiano exercitu circiter milia XV cecidisse videbantur,
sed in deditionem venerunt amplius milia XXIIII (namque etiam cohortes,
quae praesidio in castellis fuerant, sese Sullae dediderunt),
multi praeterea in finitimas civitates refugerunt;
signaque militaria ex proelio ad Caesarem sunt relata CLXXX et aquilae VIIII.
L. Domitius ex castris in montem refugiens,
cum vires eum lassitudine defecissent, ab equitibus est interfectus.


In this battle he'd lost no more than 200 soldiers, but
he lost about 30 centurions, brave men.
Crastinus, of whom we've made mention above, was also killed,
fighting most courageously, with a sword flung into his face.
And it wasn't false, what he had said in setting out to fight.
For in this way Caesar thought that Crastinus' courage in the battle had been
most excellent, and he judged that he deserved great credit from himself.
Out of Pompey's army about 15 thousand appeared to have fallen,
but more than 24 thousand came to surrender 
(indeed, even the cohorts that had been garrisoned in the towns
surrendered to Sulla),
besides them, many had fled to the neighboring cities;
and 180 military standards and 9 eagles from the battle were tendered to Caesar.
L. Domitius was fleeing from camp to a mountain,
and after his men failed him, overcome by exhaustion, was killed by the cavalry.
