Alma Dei prior acta refert, et daemonis iras,
Spes sua suasore hoc falsa est a relligione
Missa Catisbaeo, socios is convocat, et rem
Pulveream inducit, consultusque approbat illam
Garnetus; Faucum transmittit Belgia, coeptis
Qui fossis praeit. Hinc ad busta precatur Elizae
Flens pia Relligio, coeli cui subvenit ales;
Temporaque indicti sunt interrupta senatus.
Littera Monteglo datur, hanc rex discutit, inde
Pulveris exponens, cui iussa est cautio, technam.

Before it/she brought back God's loving deeds, and the devil's wrath,
Hope its/her by this counselor was deceived from religion/piety
sent by Catesby, he called allies together, and brought in
gunpowder, and the experienced Garnet approved it;
Belgium sent Fawkes over, toby scheme
and he precedes in dikes.  From this to corpses he begs Eliza
pious Religion weeping, to whom a bird of the sky/heaven ca/ome to help;
And in short shrift councils were proclaimed.
A letter is given to Monteagle, this the king examines, thence
exposing/abandoning the powder, to whom precaution was commanded, >trick.
