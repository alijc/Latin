I. ad Cornelium

CUI dono lepidum novum libellum
arida modo pumice expolitum?
Corneli, tibi: namque tu solebas
meas esse aliquid putare nugas
iam tum, cum ausus es unus Italorum
omne aevum tribus explicare cartis
doctis, Iuppiter, et laboriosis.
quare habe tibi quidquid hoc libelli
qualecumque; quod, patrona virgo
plus uno maneat perenne saeclo.

AJC 
I. to Cornelius

To whom shall I give a delightful new book,
polished with dry pumice?
To you, Cornelius; for you were wont of old
to reckon my trifles of some worth,
as you are the daring one of the Italians
to unfold the whole age with three books,
clever, by Jupiter, and painstaking.
Take then, this book, however it is;
that, fair muse, may endure for all the ages.
END
