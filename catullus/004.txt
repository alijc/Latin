IV. de phasello

Phaselus ille, quem videtis, hospites,
ait fuisse navium celerrimus,
neque ullius natantis impetum trabis
nequisse praeterire, sive palmulis
opus foret volare sive linteo.
et hoc negat minacis Hadriatici
negare litus insulasve Cycladas
Rhodumque nobilem horridamque Thraciam
Propontida trucemve Ponticum sinum,
ubi iste post phaselus antea fuit
comata silva; nam Cytorio in iugo
loquente saepe sibilum edidit coma.

IV. The cutter

That cutter that you see, my guests,
says it's the fastest of ships,
and the challenge of any floating barque
it couldn't not excel, whether by the oar
or by the sail the task would be to fly.

and this shore does not of the Adriatic menace
deny the Cyclades isles or
both the noble Rhodes and grim Thrace
Propontida or savage bending Pontic,
where this thing afterwards the skiff was beforehand
a leafy forest; for by Cytorius in yoke
by speaking often shushing put forth leaves.
