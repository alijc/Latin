IV. de phasello

Phaselus ille, quem videtis, hospites,
ait fuisse navium celerrimus,
neque ullius natantis impetum trabis
nequisse praeterire, sive palmulis
opus foret volare sive linteo.
et hoc negat minacis Hadriatici
negare litus insulasve Cycladas
Rhodumque nobilem horridamque Thraciam
Propontida trucemve Ponticum sinum,
ubi iste post phaselus antea fuit
comata silva; nam Cytorio in iugo
loquente saepe sibilum edidit coma.

IV. The cutter

That cutter that you see, my guests,
says that she was the swiftest of ships,
and the rush of any floating barque
it couldn't not surpass, whether by oar
or sail the task would be to fly.
and this she denies, that the menacing Adriatic's
shore denies the Cyclades isles or
both the noble Rhodes and frightful Thrace
the Propontis or savage Pontic bay,
what later was a cutter was before
a leafy forest; for on Cytorius' ridge,
often rustling, she puts forth leaves.
