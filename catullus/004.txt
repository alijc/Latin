IV. de phasello

Phaselus ille, quem videtis, hospites,
ait fuisse navium celerrimus,
neque ullius natantis impetum trabis
nequisse praeterire, sive palmulis
opus foret volare sive linteo.
et hoc negat minacis Hadriatici
negare litus insulasve Cycladas
Rhodumque nobilem horridamque Thraciam
Propontida trucemve Ponticum sinum,
ubi iste post phaselus antea fuit
comata silva; nam Cytorio in iugo
loquente saepe sibilum edidit coma.
Amastri Pontica et Cytore buxifer,
tibi haec fuisse et esse cognitissima
ait phaselus: ultima ex origine
tuo stetisse dicit in cacumine,
tuo imbuisse palmulas in aequore,
et inde tot per impotentia freta
erum tulisse, laeva sive dextera
vocaret aura, sive utrumque Iuppiter
simul secundus incidisset in pedem;
neque ulla vota litoralibus deis
sibi esse facta, cum veniret a mari
novissimo hunc ad usque limpidum lacum.
sed haec prius fuere: nunc recondita
senet quiete seque dedicat tibi,
gemelle Castor et gemelle Castoris. 


That cutter that you see, my guests,
says that she was the swiftest of ships,
and the rush of any floating barque
it couldn't not surpass, whether by oar
or sail the task would be to fly.
and this she denies, that the menacing Adriatic's
shore denies the Cyclades isles or
both the noble Rhodes and frightful Thrace
the Propontis or savage Pontic bay,
what later was a cutter was before
a leafy forest; for on Cytorius' ridge,
often rustling, she did put forth leaves.

AJC 

O Pontic Amastris and Cytorus, bearing boxwood,
the cutter says that this was and is well-known to you:
far from her birth
she says that she stood tall upon your peak,
that she dipped her oars into your quiet sea,
and from there through so many stormy straits
she bore her master, whether a breeze called
from the left hand or the right, or whether
a fair Jovian wind did fill the sails;
nor were any vows made by her to the seaside gods, 
when she came from the farthest sea up to the clear lake.
But that's as she was before: now laid away,
she  quietly grows old and gives herself to you,
the twin-born Castor and Castor's twin.
