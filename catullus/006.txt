VI. ad Flavium

Flavi, delicias tuas Catullo,
ni sint illepidae atque inelegantes,
velles dicere nec tacere posses.
verum nescio quid febriculosi
scorti diligis: hoc pudet fateri.
nam te non viduas iacere noctes
nequiquam tacitum cubile clamat
sertis ac Syrio fragrans olivo,
pulvinusque peraeque et hic et ille
attritus, tremulique quassa lecti
argutatio inambulatioque.
nam inista prevalet nihil tacere.
cur? non tam latera ecfututa pandas,
ni tu quid facias ineptiarum.
quare, quidquid habes boni malique,
dic nobis. volo te ac tuos amores
ad caelum lepido vocare versu. 


START
AJC
Flavius, your darling to Catullus,
unless she lacked both grace and taste,
you'd want to name, and couldn't keep still.
In truth I do not know which fevered
harlot you love: you're ashamed to disclose this.
For you do not lie down through widowed nights
in vain, so your silent bed cries out,
and with garlands and scented Syrian oil,
and a pillow here and there evenly
worn down, and a shaking creaking
and rocking of your quaking bed.
For with all these, it avails you nothing to be silent.
Why? For you wouldn't bend your shagged out flanks,
unless you were playing the fool.
Therefore, whatever you have, good and bad,
tell us.  I wish to call you and your loves
to heaven in a witty verse.
END
