VI. ad Flavium

Flavi, delicias tuas Catullo,
ni sint illepidae atque inelegantes,
velles dicere nec tacere posses.
verum nescio quid febriculosi
scorti diligis: hoc pudet fateri.
nam te non viduas iacere noctes
nequiquam tacitum cubile clamat
sertis ac Syrio fragrans olivo,
pulvinusque peraeque et hic et ille
attritus, tremulique quassa lecti
argutatio inambulatioque.
nam inista prevalet nihil tacere.
cur? non tam latera ecfututa pandas,
ni tu quid facias ineptiarum.
quare, quidquid habes boni malique,
dic nobis. volo te ac tuos amores
ad caelum lepido vocare versu.

Flavius, your racy verses to Catullus,
unless they lacked both grace and taste,
you wished to utter, nor could you keep still.

I know not the truth of which feverish
harlot/rentboy you esteem: this shames (me) to confess.

For you do not deprive to hurl the nights/
For by you is not thrown the widowed nights
in vain the silent marriage bed cries out
and to/with wreathed with scented Syrian oil,
and a cushion equally both this and that
worn down, and trembling beds and a shaking
creaking a walking up and down.

For stand thee on, it prevails nothing to be still.

Why? For you spread out your fucked out flanks,
if not that you might make of follies.

How, whatever you have, good and bad,
tell us.  I wish even your loves to yourself
to call to heaven with a charming verse.
