VIII. ad se ipsum

Miser Catulle, desinas ineptire,
et quod vides perisse perditum ducas.
fulsere quondam candidi tibi soles,
cum ventitabas quo puella ducebat
amata nobis quantum amabitur nulla.
ibi illa multa cum iocosa fiebant,
quae tu volebas nec puella nolebat,
fulsere vere candidi tibi soles.
nunc iam illa non vult: tu quoque impotens noli,
nec quae fugit sectare, nec miser vive,
sed obstinata mente perfer, obdura.
vale puella, iam Catullus obdurat,
nec te requiret nec rogabit invitam.
at tu dolebis, cum rogaberis nulla.
scelesta, vae te, quae tibi manet vita?
quis nunc te adibit? cui videberis bella?
quem nunc amabis? cuius esse diceris?
quem basiabis? cui labella mordebis?
at tu, Catulle, destinatus obdura. 


VIII. to himself

Poor Catullus, you (should) stop playing the fool,
and you see that you should consider the lost to have been lost.

Once bright suns shone upon you,
when you often went where the girl would lead
beloved by us such as she'll be loved (nulla).

There those many things were done in sport,
which you wished to do, nor was the girl unwilling,
truly bright suns shone upon you.

Now already those things are not willing: besides, you are powerless to refuse,
she flees, neither pursue, or live unhappy,
but carry on with a firm mind, endure.

Farewell girl, Catullus now endures,
and will neither seek you or ask against your will.

But you'll be sad, when I will ask for nothing.

Wicked one, woe to thee, who stays to me with life?
Who now will visit thee? To whom will you seem fair?
Whom will you kiss?  Whose lips will you bite?
But you, Catullus, stay resolute.
