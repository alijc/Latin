VIII. ad se ipsum

Miser Catulle, desinas ineptire,
et quod vides perisse perditum ducas.
fulsere quondam candidi tibi soles,
cum ventitabas quo puella ducebat
amata nobis quantum amabitur nulla.
ibi illa multa cum iocosa fiebant,
quae tu volebas nec puella nolebat,
fulsere vere candidi tibi soles.
nunc iam illa non vult: tu quoque impotens noli,
nec quae fugit sectare, nec miser vive,
sed obstinata mente perfer, obdura.
vale puella, iam Catullus obdurat,
nec te requiret nec rogabit invitam.
at tu dolebis, cum rogaberis nulla.
scelesta, vae te, quae tibi manet vita?
quis nunc te adibit? cui videberis bella?
quem nunc amabis? cuius esse diceris?
quem basiabis? cui labella mordebis?
at tu, Catulle, destinatus obdura. 


VIII. to himself

Poor Catullus, stop this foolishness,
and consider as lost what you have seen is gone.
Once bright suns shone upon you,
when you often went where the girl would lead
loved by us such as she'll be loved no more.
Then those many things were done in sport,
which you wished to do, nor did the girl refuse,
truly bright suns shone upon you.
Now she is no longer willing: besides, you're weak, refuse her,
neither pursue her as she flees, or live unhappy,
but carry on with a firm mind, be hard.
Farewell girl, Catullus is now hard,
and will not seek you out or ask against your will.
But you'll be sad, when you are not requested.
Cursed villainess, what life remains for you?
Who'll visit you now? To whom will you seem fair?
Whom will you love now? Whose will you be called?
Whom will you kiss?  Whose lips will you bite?
But you, Catullus, be hard and resolute.
