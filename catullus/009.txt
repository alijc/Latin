IX. ad Veranium

Verani, omnibus e meis amicis
antistans mihi milibus trecentis,
venistine domum ad tuos penates
fratresque unanimos anumque matrem?
venisti. o mihi nuntii beati!
visam te incolumem audiamque Hiberum
narrantem loca, facta nationes,
ut mos est tuus, applicansque collum
iucundum os oculosque suaviabor.
o quantum est hominum beatiorum,
quid me laetius est beatiusve?

IX. to Veranius

Veranius, of all of my friends
surpassing me 300,000 times over,
did you come home to your family gods
and like-minded brothers and eldery mother?

You have come.  What great news!

I will see you safe and hear of Spain
recounted, places, created, peoples,
as is your custom, and connecting the neck
delightful, mouth and eyes to be kissed.

O how much it is of happy men,
that by me it is happier or more fortunate?
