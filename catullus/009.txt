IX. ad Veranium

Verani, omnibus e meis amicis
antistans mihi milibus trecentis,
venistine domum ad tuos penates
fratresque unanimos anumque matrem?
venisti. o mihi nuntii beati!
visam te incolumem audiamque Hiberum
narrantem loca, facta nationes,
ut mos est tuus, applicansque collum
iucundum os oculosque suaviabor.
o quantum est hominum beatiorum,
quid me laetius est beatiusve?

IX. to Veranius

Veranius, who in my thoughts surpasses 
all of my friends many times over,
have you come home to your family gods
and like-minded brothers and old mother?
You have come.  What wonderful news!
I will see you safe and hear accounts
of Spain - places, deeds, and people,
as is your custom, and embracing your
delightful neck, I will kiss your mouth and eyes.
O, of all the more blest men,
who is more joyful or blest than I?
