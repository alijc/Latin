X. ad Varum 

Varus me meus ad suos amores
visum duxerat e foro otiosum,
scortillum, ut mihi tum repente visum est,
non sane illepidum neque invenustum,
huc ut venimus, incidere nobis
sermones varii, in quibus, quid esset
iam Bithynia, quo modo se haberet,
et quonam mihi profuisset aere.
respondi id quod erat, nihil neque ipsis
nec praetoribus esse nec cohorti,
cur quisquam caput unctius referret,
praesertim quibus esset irrumator
praetor, nec faceret pili cohortem.
'at certe tamen,' inquiunt 'quod illic
natum dicitur esse, comparasti
ad lecticam homines.' ego, ut puellae
unum me facerem beatiorem,
'non' inquam 'mihi tam fuit maligne
ut, provincia quod mala incidisset,
non possem octo homines parare rectos.'

X. to Varus

My Varus/bandy-legged/pimple to his love
had brought to see me from the market,
an idle whore, when I first saw her,
not too impolite or ungraceful.

When we came here, there fell to us
several converstions, about, what's up with
Bithynia these days, how it is holding together,
and had it somehow earned me money.

I answered there was nothing, not to the people
or to the governors, or their retinue,
why anyone would bring back an anointed head,
especially to those who have a dispicable
governor, who didn't get his retinue as much as a hair.

'But really now,' they say, 'how did you 
compare that 
the son is said to be, you have provided
men to his litter.' I, in order to pass
myself off to a girl as the one better than everyone else
say 'it was not niggardly to me
that, how the wicked province should have fallen,
I shouldn't be able to furnish eight straight-backed men.
