X. ad Varum 

Varus me meus ad suos amores
visum duxerat e foro otiosum,
scortillum, ut mihi tum repente visum est,
non sane illepidum neque invenustum,
huc ut venimus, incidere nobis
sermones varii, in quibus, quid esset
iam Bithynia, quo modo se haberet,
et quonam mihi profuisset aere.
respondi id quod erat, nihil neque ipsis
nec praetoribus esse nec cohorti,
cur quisquam caput unctius referret,
praesertim quibus esset irrumator
praetor, nec faceret pili cohortem.
'at certe tamen,' inquiunt 'quod illic
natum dicitur esse, comparasti
ad lecticam homines.' ego, ut puellae
unum me facerem beatiorem,
'non' inquam 'mihi tam fuit maligne
ut, provincia quod mala incidisset,
non possem octo homines parare rectos.'

X. to Varus

My Varus/bandy-legged/eruption to his loves
had led an sight/visit from the market,
an idle whore, when she/he was suddenly seen by me,
not reasonably lacking in grace and not unattractive,
when we came here, to engrave to us
different words, in which, would be
even Bithynia, in which way it was held,
and by whichever had profitted me with money.

I answered because it was, nothing and not by/to themselves
and not to/by judges to be and not to a retinue,
why anyone would bring back an anointed head,
especially to whom it would be a vile person(cock-suckee)
judge, and would not have made the retinue of a hair.

'But really now,' they say, 'that there
the son is said to be, you have provided
men to his litter.' I, in order to make 
myself more happy/wealthy to a girl,
say 'it was not niggardly to me
that, the wicked province that he engraved,
I shouldn't be able to furnish eight honest men.
