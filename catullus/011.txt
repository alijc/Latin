Furi et Aureli comites Catulli,
sive in extremos penetrabit Indos,
litus ut longe resonante Eoa
     tunditur unda,
sive in Hyrcanos Arabesve molles,
seu Sagas sagittiferosve Parthos,
sive quae septemgeminus colorat
     aequora Nilus,
sive trans altas gradietur Alpes,
Caesaris visens monimenta magni,
Gallicum Rhenum horribile aequor ulti-
     mosque Britannos,
omnia haec, quaecumque feret voluntas
caelitum, temptare simul parati,
pauca nuntiate meae puellae
     non bona dicta.
cum suis vivat valeatque moechis,
quos simul complexa tenet trecentos,
nullum amans vere, sed identidem omnium
     ilia rumpens;
nec meum respectet, ut ante, amorem,
qui illius culpa cecidit velut prati
ultimi flos, praetereunte postquam
     tactus aratro est. 


A comrade to a thief and to Aurelius and Catullus,
whether he will penetrate to the furthest Indies,
the shore as the distant resounding Eoa
  is beaten by the wave,
or to the soft Arabian Hyrcanos,
or arrow-bearing Sagas or Parthos,
or who paints the sevenfold
  surfaces of the Nile,
or walks across the high Alps,
viewing Caesar's great monuments,
the awful Gallic Rhinish surface and
  far off Britons,
all these, whichever will bring the will
of the gods, to test and be ready,
announce a little to my girl
  not good having been said.
With their own the tart would live and prevail,
likewise embraced holds three hundred of those,
truly loving none, but again and again 
  breaking all of their balls;
and, as before, would not respect my love,
which sinks through her fault like a far-off
meadow's flower, (the fault) disregarding after
  it was touched by the plow.
