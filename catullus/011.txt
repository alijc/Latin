Furi et Aureli comites Catulli,
sive in extremos penetrabit Indos,
litus ut longe resonante Eoa
     tunditur unda,
sive in Hyrcanos Arabesve molles,
seu Sagas sagittiferosve Parthos,
sive quae septemgeminus colorat
     aequora Nilus,
sive trans altas gradietur Alpes,
Caesaris visens monimenta magni,
Gallicum Rhenum horribile aequor ulti-
     mosque Britannos,
omnia haec, quaecumque feret voluntas
caelitum, temptare simul parati,
pauca nuntiate meae puellae
     non bona dicta.
cum suis vivat valeatque moechis,
quos simul complexa tenet trecentos,
nullum amans vere, sed identidem omnium
     ilia rumpens;
nec meum respectet, ut ante, amorem,
qui illius culpa cecidit velut prati
ultimi flos, praetereunte postquam
     tactus aratro est. 


To/of Furius and Aurelius, comrades of Catullus,
whether {s}he will penetrate to the furthest Indies/Indus,
where the shore is buffeted by the distant echo 
  of the Eastern Sea,
or to the Hyrcanians or soft Arabians,
or Scythians or arrow-wielding Parthians,
or the plains that the seven-mouthed
  Nile dyes,
or will walk across the high Alps,
viewing the monuments of great Caesar,
the Gallic Rhine, the dreadful sea, and
  far off Britons,
all these, whichever the will of the gods
will bring, to test and be ready at the same time,
report to 'my girl' a few
  harsh remarks.
With herself let the tart live and be well,
the embraced girl holds three hundred such in thrall,
truly loving none, but again and again 
  breaking all of their balls;
and, as before, would not regard my love,
which through her guilt falls like a far-off
meadow's flower, perishing after
  being touched by the plow.
