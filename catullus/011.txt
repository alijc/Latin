Furi et Aureli comites Catulli,
sive in extremos penetrabit Indos,
litus ut longe resonante Eoa
     tunditur unda,
sive in Hyrcanos Arabesve molles,
seu Sagas sagittiferosve Parthos,
sive quae septemgeminus colorat
     aequora Nilus,
sive trans altas gradietur Alpes,
Caesaris visens monimenta magni,
Gallicum Rhenum horribile aequor ulti-
     mosque Britannos,
omnia haec, quaecumque feret voluntas
caelitum, temptare simul parati,
pauca nuntiate meae puellae
     non bona dicta.
cum suis vivat valeatque moechis,
quos simul complexa tenet trecentos,
nullum amans vere, sed identidem omnium
     ilia rumpens;
nec meum respectet, ut ante, amorem,
qui illius culpa cecidit velut prati
ultimi flos, praetereunte postquam
     tactus aratro est. 


O Furius and Aurelius, comrades of Catullus,
whether he penetrates to the furthest Indies,
where the shore is buffeted by the far-echoing
  Eastern Sea,
or to the Hyrcanians or soft Arabians,
or the Scythians or arrow-wielding Parthians,
or the sea that the seven-mouthed
  Nile dyes,
or walks across the high Alps,
viewing the monuments of great Caesar,
the Gallic Rhine, the dreadful sea, and
  far off Britons,
ready to attempt all these at once,
whatever the will of heaven will bear,
report to 'my girl' a few
  harsh remarks.
Let her live and be well with her rakes,
hundreds of whom the embraced girl holds at once,
truly loving none, but again and again 
  busting the balls of every one;
let her not, as before, look back on my love,
which because of her two-timing has fallen like a distant
meadow's flower, after being touched
  by a passing plow.
