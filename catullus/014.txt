XIV. ad Calvum poetam 

Ni te plus oculis meis amarem,
iucundissime Calve, munere isto
odissem te odio Vatiniano:
nam quid feci ego quidve sum locutus,
cur me tot male perderes poetis?
isti di mala multa dent clienti,
qui tantum tibi misit impiorum.
quod si, ut suspicor, hoc novum ac repertum
munus dat tibi Sulla litterator,
non est mi male, sed bene ac beate,
quod non dispereunt tui labores.

XIV. to the poet Calvus

If I didn't love you more than my own eyes,
most agreeable Calvus, on account of that gift of yours
I would hate you as much as Vatinius does:
for what have I done, or what have I said,
that you have destroyed me so shamefully with poets?
May your gods bestow much harm on your client,
who sent to you so many scroundrels.
But if, as I suspect, this fresh and newly discovered 
gift was bestowed on you by the schoolmaster Sulla, 
I think it, not ill, but good and fortunate,
because your labors are not lost.
