XIV. ad Calvum poetam 

Ni te plus oculis meis amarem,
iucundissime Calve, munere isto
odissem te odio Vatiniano:
nam quid feci ego quidve sum locutus,
cur me tot male perderes poetis?
isti di mala multa dent clienti,
qui tantum tibi misit impiorum.
quod si, ut suspicor, hoc novum ac repertum
munus dat tibi Sulla litterator,
non est mi male, sed bene ac beate,
quod non dispereunt tui labores.

XIV. to the poet Calvus

Unless I loved you more than my eyes,
most agreeable Calvus, by that service/duty/gift (of yours)
I'd have hated you with the Vatinian hate:
for what have _I_ done, or what have I said,
why you ruin me so badly to poets?
Let those gods of yours give many bad things to their vassal/dependent,
who hurls so much impious stuff to you.
Because if, as I suspect, this new and discovered 
duty/gift that the schoolmaster Sulla gives to you 
is to me not ill, but right and happy,
because your works are not lost.

END
