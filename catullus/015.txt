XV. ad Aurelium

Commendo tibi me ac meos amores,
Aureli. veniam peto pudentem,
ut, si quicquam animo tuo cupisti,
quod castum expeteres et integellum,
conserves puerum mihi pudice,
non dico a populo—nihil veremur
istos, qui in platea modo huc modo illuc
in re praetereunt sua occupati—
verum a te metuo tuoque pene
infesto pueris bonis malisque.
quem tu qua lubet, ut lubet moveto
quantum vis, ubi erit foris paratum:
hunc unum excipio, ut puto, pudenter.
quod si te mala mens furorque vecors
in tantam impulerit, sceleste, culpam,
ut nostrum insidiis caput lacessas.
a tum te miserum malique fati!
quem attractis pedibus patente porta
percurrent raphanique mugilesque.

I commend myself and my love to you,
Aurelius.  I beg a modest favor,
that, if you wished any thing for your soul,
you should ask for what is pure and unharmed,
should keep safe a virtuous boy for me,
I do not say from a people/poplar - we fear/respect nothing
those of yours, who in the street hither and thither
in fact pass by their own things, busy -
in truth I fear from/by/before you and to/from your penis
dangerous to boys good and bad.
what you, by which it pleases, will move, as it pleases
as much as you want, where it will be ready out-of-doors:
I get this one boy, as I think, honorably.
But if an evil mind and frenzied rage/love
urge you so much on, you wicked man, the crime,
that you might assail our head with treachery.
Then by you, wretch of evil doom!
What by feet drawn together by the open gate
they run through both radishes and mullet.

END
