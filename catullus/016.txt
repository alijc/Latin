XVI. ad Aurelium et Furium

Pedicabo ego vos et irrumabo,
Aureli pathice et cinaede Furi,
qui me ex versiculis meis putastis,
quod sunt molliculi, parum pudicum.
nam castum esse decet pium poetam
ipsum, versiculos nihil necesse est;
qui tum denique habent salem ac leporem,
si sunt molliculi ac parum pudici,
et quod pruriat incitare possunt,
non dico pueris, sed his pilosis
qui duros nequeunt movere lumbos.
vos, quod milia multa basiorum
legistis, male me marem putatis?
pedicabo ego vos et irrumabo.

XVI. to Aurelius and Furius

I will sodomize and bugger you,
pansy Aurelius and Furius the faggot,
who reckoned me, from my little verses
(which are tender), not virtuous enough.
For it is proper for a chaste poet to be righteous
himself, nothing is needful (to) little verses;
that, moreover, have wit and charm,
if they are tender and not chaste enough,
and they can arouse that which itches (sexually arouses),
I don't recite them to children, but to bearded ones
who are unable to stir their hard/rough loins/....
You, because you have collected many thousands of kisses,
think me a poor excuse for a man?
I will sodomize and bugger you.

END
