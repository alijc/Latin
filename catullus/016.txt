XVI. ad Aurelium et Furium

Pedicabo ego vos et irrumabo,
Aureli pathice et cinaede Furi,
qui me ex versiculis meis putastis,
quod sunt molliculi, parum pudicum.
nam castum esse decet pium poetam
ipsum, versiculos nihil necesse est;
qui tum denique habent salem ac leporem,
si sunt molliculi ac parum pudici,
et quod pruriat incitare possunt,
non dico pueris, sed his pilosis
qui duros nequeunt movere lumbos.
vos, quod milia multa basiorum
legistis, male me marem putatis?
pedicabo ego vos et irrumabo. 


XVI. to Aurelius and Furius

I'll screw you and bugger you both,
pansy Aurelius and Furius the faggot,
who reckoned, because my little verses
are sensual, that I am not virtuous enough.
For it is proper for an upright poet to be chaste
himself, but no such is needed in his verses;
that, then and now, have wit and charm,
if they are sensual and not virtuous enough,
and can arouse that itching lust in,
I don't say in boys, but in those hairier ones
who cannot shake their stiffened parts.
You, because you have read of many thousands of kisses,
think me a poor excuse for a man?
I'll screw you and bugger you both.
