XVII. 

O Colonia, quae cupis ponte ludere longo,
et salire paratum habes, sed vereris inepta
crura ponticuli axulis stantis in redivivis,
ne supinus eat cavaque in palude recumbat:
sic tibi bonus ex tua pons libidine fiat,
in quo vel Salisubsali sacra suscipiantur,
munus hoc mihi maximi da, Colonia, risus.
quendam municipem meum de tuo volo ponte
ire praecipitem in lutum per caputque pedesque,
verum totius ut lacus putidaeque paludis
lividissima maximeque est profunda vorago.
insulsissimus est homo, nec sapit pueri instar
bimuli tremula patris dormientis in ulna.

O Cologna, you that wants to stage games on your causeway,
and have a preparation for dancing, but fears the shaky
legs of the measely bridge standing (men) on secondhand boards,
let him not go flat on his back and sink down in a deep marsh:

so let a bridge be made for you freely from your whats,
in which even/indeed the holy/sacred Salisubsali were supported/taken up,
give me this tribute of the greatest, Cologna, laughter.
I wish that my certain citizen from your bridge
went headlong into the mud, head over heels,
in truth of all while a basin and of a rotten marsh
most and exceedingly bruise colored is a deep chasm.
Man is very stupid, and hasn't got the sense of a
two year old boy on the trembling arm of his sleeping father.
