XVII. 

O Colonia, quae cupis ponte ludere longo,
et salire paratum habes, sed vereris inepta
crura ponticuli axulis stantis in redivivis,
ne supinus eat cavaque in palude recumbat:
sic tibi bonus ex tua pons libidine fiat,
in quo vel Salisubsali sacra suscipiantur,
munus hoc mihi maximi da, Colonia, risus.
quendam municipem meum de tuo volo ponte
ire praecipitem in lutum per caputque pedesque,
verum totius ut lacus putidaeque paludis
lividissima maximeque est profunda vorago.
insulsissimus est homo, nec sapit pueri instar
bimuli tremula patris dormientis in ulna.

O Cologna, you who wants to stage games on your causeway,
and have a preparation for dancing, but fears the shaky
legs of the measely bridge standing (men) on secondhand boards,
let him not go flat on his back and sink down in the deep marsh:
so let a bridge be made for you on account your desire,
on which even the holy dancing priests of Mars could be supported,
give me, Cologna, this gift of the greatest laughter.
I wish for a certain fellow citizen of mine from your bridge
to go headlong into the mud, head over heels,
in truth in all where of the pool and the stinking bog
is the darkest bruise-colored and deepest abyss.
The man is an ass, and hasn't got the sense of a
two year old boy on the trembling arm of his sleeping father.
