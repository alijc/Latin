XVII. 

O Colonia, quae cupis ponte ludere longo,
et salire paratum habes, sed vereris inepta
crura ponticuli axulis stantis in redivivis,
ne supinus eat cavaque in palude recumbat:
sic tibi bonus ex tua pons libidine fiat,
in quo vel Salisubsali sacra suscipiantur,
munus hoc mihi maximi da, Colonia, risus.
quendam municipem meum de tuo volo ponte
ire praecipitem in lutum per caputque pedesque,
verum totius ut lacus putidaeque paludis
lividissima maximeque est profunda vorago.
insulsissimus est homo, nec sapit pueri instar
bimuli tremula patris dormientis in ulna.

O Cologna, you who want to stage sports on your causeway,
and have an deal for dancing, but are shy of the shaky
legs of the measly span erected on secondhand slats,
lest it fall flat and drop in the depths of the bog.
So may a bridge be made for you due to your desire,
on which even the holy prancing priests of Mars would be borne.
Give me, Cologna, this gift of greatest glee.
I want a certain townsman of mine to go from your bridge
head over heels, headlong into the mud, 
where surely all the tide pool and the stinking bog
is the most leaden and lowest abyss.
The man is an ass, and has not the sense of a
two year old boy on the trembling arm of his sleeping father.
