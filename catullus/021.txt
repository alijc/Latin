XXI. ad Aurelium

Aureli, pater esuritionum,
non harum modo, sed quot aut fuerunt
aut sunt aut aliis erunt in annis,
pedicare cupis meos amores.
nec clam: nam simul es, iocaris una,
haerens ad latus omnia experiris.
frustra: nam insidias mihi instruentem
tangam te prior irrumatione.
atque id si faceres satur, tacerem:
nunc ipsum id doleo, quod esurire
me me puer et sitire discet.
quare desine, dum licet pudico,
ne finem facias, sed irrumatus.

XXI. to Aurelius

O Aurelius, father of starvations,
not only of these now, but of many that were
or are or will be in other years,
you'd like to screw my loverboy in the butt.
And not in secret: for while you're with him, you joke together,
clinging to his side you try it all.
In vain: for the snares laid for me
I'll get you first, shoving my prick down your throat.
And, if you're satisfied, I'd be quiet about it:
now I myself suffer it, because, alas,
the boy will learn to hunger and thirst.
Stop therefore, while you modestly can,
lest you come to an end, but be fucked in the face.
