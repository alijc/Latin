XXI. ad Aurelium

Aureli, pater esuritionum,
non harum modo, sed quot aut fuerunt
aut sunt aut aliis erunt in annis,
pedicare cupis meos amores.
nec clam: nam simul es, iocaris una,
haerens ad latus omnia experiris.
frustra: nam insidias mihi instruentem
tangam te prior irrumatione.
atque id si faceres satur, tacerem:
nunc ipsum id doleo, quod esurire
me me puer et sitire discet.
quare desine, dum licet pudico,
ne finem facias, sed irrumatus.

XXI. to Aurelius

O Aurelius, father of hungers,
not only of these, but how many that either were
or are or will be in other years,
you'd like to sodomize my loverboy.
And not in secret: for while you're with him, you jest one,
clinging to his side you attempt it all.
In vain: for the treachery(p) to me constructed(s)
I would strike you before shoving my prick down your throat.
And, if you do enough, I'd be silent about it:
now I suffer it myself, because to be in heat
alas the boy will learn to thirst.
How will you stop, while it's permitted to the virtuous,
lest you make an end, but face-fucked.
