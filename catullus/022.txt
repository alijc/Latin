XXII. ad Varum 

Suffenus iste, Vare, quem probe nosti,
homo est venustus et dicax et urbanus,
idemque longe plurimos facit versus.
puto esse ego illi milia aut decem aut plura
perscripta, nec sic ut fit in palimpsesto
relata: cartae regiae, novi libri,
novi umbilici, lora rubra membranae,
derecta plumbo et pumice omnia aequata.
haec cum legas tu, bellus ille et urbanus
Suffenus unus caprimulgus aut fossor
rursus videtur: tantum abhorret ac mutat.

XXII. to Varus

That Suffenus of yours, Varus, whom you know well,
the man is charming and witty and urbane,
and at the same time makes the most verses by far.
I think that ten thousand or even more have been written out by him,
and not, as is the norm, recorded on reused parchment:
but high-grade paper, new volumes,
new scroll-ends, red parchment covers,
all lined with lead pencil and smoothed with pumice.
When you read these, that handsome and urbane 
Suffenus appears, conversely, a mere country yokel or a ditch-digger:
he alters and changes so much.
