XXII. ad Varum 

Suffenus iste, Vare, quem probe nosti,
homo est venustus et dicax et urbanus,
idemque longe plurimos facit versus.
puto esse ego illi milia aut decem aut plura
perscripta, nec sic ut fit in palimpsesto
relata: cartae regiae, novi libri,
novi umbilici, lora rubra membranae,
derecta plumbo et pumice omnia aequata.
haec cum legas tu, bellus ille et urbanus
Suffenus unus caprimulgus aut fossor
rursus videtur: tantum abhorret ac mutat.

XXII. to Varus

That Suffenus of yours, Varus, whom you know well,
the man is charming and witty and urbane,
and at the same time makes the most verses by far.
I think that ten thousand or even more have been written out by him,
and not, as is the norm, recorded on reused parchment:
but high-grade paper, new volumes,
new scroll-ends, red parchment covers,
all lined with lead pencil and smoothed with pumice.
When you read these, that handsome and urbane 
Suffenus appears, conversely, a mere country yokel or a ditch-digger:
he alters and changes so much.

hoc quid putemus esse? qui modo scurra
aut si quid hac re scitius videbatur,
idem infaceto est infacetior rure,
simul poemata attigit, neque idem umquam
aeque est beatus ac poema cum scribit:
tam gaudet in se tamque se ipse miratur.
nimirum idem omnes fallimur, neque est quisquam
quem non in aliqua re videre Suffenum
possis. suus cuique attributus est error;
sed non videmus manticae quod in tergo est.

Why do we think this is? What sort of idler/towndweller/gent
or what by this matter seemed shrewder,
it is likewise/the same coarse and coarser in the country,
likewise and/even he touched/es/reached/es poems, and not just one
it is equally fortunate and while he writes a poem:
he rejoices so much in himself and he himself marvels so at himself.
Without doubt, we are all deceived/disappointed, and there is no man
who can not see Suffenus in a certain matter.
His lot in life, and to him, is to go astray/wander;
But we do not see the of the knapsack that is on his back.
