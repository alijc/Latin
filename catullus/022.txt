XXII. ad Varum 

Suffenus iste, Vare, quem probe nosti,
homo est venustus et dicax et urbanus,
idemque longe plurimos facit versus.
puto esse ego illi milia aut decem aut plura
perscripta, nec sic ut fit in palimpsesto
relata: cartae regiae, novi libri,
novi umbilici, lora rubra membranae,
derecta plumbo et pumice omnia aequata.
haec cum legas tu, bellus ille et urbanus
Suffenus unus caprimulgus aut fossor
rursus videtur: tantum abhorret ac mutat.

XXII. to Varus

That Suffenus of yours, Varus, whom you properly knwew,
the man is charming and witty and urbane,
and also creates by far the most verses.

I think that to him are thousands or ten or more
described, and not such while he is made in palimpsest
(the things) reported: royal charters, new books,
new scroll-ends?, reddish straps of parchment,
straightened/directed by lead and made all even with pumice.

You yourself entrust/would read these things, that handsome and urbane 
Suffenus a country bumpkin or digger
he seems again: so much he shrinks back and changes.
