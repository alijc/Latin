XXII. ad Varum 

Suffenus iste, Vare, quem probe nosti,
homo est venustus et dicax et urbanus,
idemque longe plurimos facit versus.
puto esse ego illi milia aut decem aut plura
perscripta, nec sic ut fit in palimpsesto
relata: cartae regiae, novi libri,
novi umbilici, lora rubra membranae,
derecta plumbo et pumice omnia aequata.
haec cum legas tu, bellus ille et urbanus
Suffenus unus caprimulgus aut fossor
rursus videtur: tantum abhorret ac mutat.

XXII. to Varus

That Suffenus of yours, Varus, whom you properly knew,
the man is charming and witty and urbane,
and at the same time creates the most verses by far.

I think that to him are tens of thousands or even more
ascribed, and not such as is usually done, on palimpsest
recorded: high-grade paper, new books,
new scroll-rods, red parchment covers,
all lined with a lead and smoothed with pumice.

You may read these things, that handsome and urbane 
Suffenus a mere country bumpkin or delver
on the contrary he appears: so much he shrinks back and changes.
