XXIII. ad Furium 

Furi cui neque servus est neque arca
nec cimex neque araneus neque ignis,
verum est et pater et noverca, quorum
dentes vel silicem comesse possunt,
est pulcre tibi cum tuo parente
et cum coniuge lignea parentis.
nec mirum: bene nam valetis omnes,
pulcre concoquitis, nihil timetis,
non incendia, non graves rvinas,
non facta impia, non dolos veneni,
non casus alios periculorum.
atque corpora sicciora cornu
aut siquid magis aridum est habetis
sole et frigore et esuritione.

XXIII. to Furius

To Furius, who's got neither slave nor strong-box
nor bed-bug nor spider nor fire,
in fact just a father and stepmother, whose
teeth can chew through even pebbles,
it goes well enough for you, with your pa
and with your pa's sinewy spouse.
And that's not a marvel: for you all fare well,
you endure nobly, you fear nothing,
neither fires, nor serious collapses,
or wicked thievery, or poisonous plots,
or other misfortunes of danger.
And you have bodies that are drier than horn
or whatever is even more parched
by sun and cold and hunger.

quare non tibi sit bene ac beate?
a te sudor abest, abest saliva,
mucusque et mala pituita nasi.
hanc ad munditiem adde mundiorem,
quod culus tibi purior salillo est,
nec toto decies cacas in anno;
atque id durius est faba et lapillis.
quod tu si manibus teras fricesque,
non umquam digitum inquinare posses
haec tu commoda tam beata, Furi,
noli spernere nec putare parvi,
et sestertia quae soles precari
centum desine: nam sat es beatus.

How could it not be well and forunate for you?
Sweat is far from you, as is spit,
snot and the evil phlegm of the nose.
add this to elegance of the more elegant,
because your butt is purer than a little salt cellar,
and you don't shit more than ten times a year;
and it is harder than a bean or a stone.
Because if you rub and chafe with your hands,
you'd never be able to soil a finger
these advantages you so blessed, Furius,
don't scorn or think men small,
and 2 1/2 that you are wont to beg for
leave off 100, for you are happy enough.
