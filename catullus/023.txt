XXIII. ad Furium 

Furi cui neque servus est neque arca
nec cimex neque araneus neque ignis,
verum est et pater et noverca, quorum
dentes vel silicem comesse possunt,
est pulcre tibi cum tuo parente
et cum coniuge lignea parentis.
nec mirum: bene nam valetis omnes,
pulcre concoquitis, nihil timetis,
non incendia, non graves rvinas,
non facta impia, non dolos veneni,
non casus alios periculorum.
atque corpora sicciora cornu
aut siquid magis aridum est habetis
sole et frigore et esuritione.

XXIII. to Furius

To Furius, who's got neither slave nor strong-box
nor bed-bug nor spider nor fire,
in fact just a father and stepmother, whose
teeth can chew through even pebbles,
it goes well enough for you, with your pa
and with your pa's sinewy spouse.
And that's not a marvel: for you all fare well,
you endure nobly, you fear nothing,
neither fires, nor serious collapses,
or wicked thievery, or poisonous plots,
or other misfortunes of danger.
And you have bodies that are drier than horn
or whatever is even more parched
by sun and cold and hunger.

quare non tibi sit bene ac beate?
a te sudor abest, abest saliva,
mucusque et mala pituita nasi.
hanc ad munditiem adde mundiorem,
quod culus tibi purior salillo est,
nec toto decies cacas in anno;
atque id durius est faba et lapillis.
quod tu si manibus teras fricesque,
non umquam digitum inquinare posses
haec tu commoda tam beata, Furi,
noli spernere nec putare parvi,
et sestertia quae soles precari
centum desine: nam sat es beatus.

How could it not be good and forunate for you?
Sweat is far from you, as is spit,
snot and yucky nose slime.
Add to this elegance the yet more elegant,
that your butt is cleaner than a dish of salt,
and you don't shit more than ten times a year;
and that's harder than a bean or stones.
That if you rub it and knead it with your hands,
you couldn't soil so much as a finger.
These advantages are so fortunate for you, Furius,
that you should neither scorn them or think them trifling,
and the 100 sesterces that you are wont to beg for,
forget them, for you are happy enough.
