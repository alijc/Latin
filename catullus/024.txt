XXIV. ad Iuventium

O qui flosculus es Iuventiorum,
non horum modo, sed quot aut fuerunt
aut posthac aliis erunt in annis,
mallem divitias Midae dedisses
isti, cui neque servus est neque arca,
quam sic te sineres ab illo amari.
'qui? non est homo bellus?' inquies. est:
sed bello huic neque servus est neque arca.
hoc tu quam lubet abice elevaque:
nec servum tamen ille habet neque arcam.


XXIV. to Juventius

O, what a flowerlet you are of Juventius',
not of this mode, but how many there either were
or will be for others in the future,
I preferred that you had given the riches of Midas
to that one, to whom you are neither a servant nor a strong-box,
than you so permitted yourself to be loved by that one.
'How so? Is he not a handsome man?' you say.  He is:
but to this handsome man you are neither a servant nor a strong-box.
Cast this aside and raise up no matter what:
but that one has neither a servent nor a strong-box.
