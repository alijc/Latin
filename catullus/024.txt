XXIV. ad Iuventium

O qui flosculus es Iuventiorum,
non horum modo, sed quot aut fuerunt
aut posthac aliis erunt in annis,
mallem divitias Midae dedisses
isti, cui neque servus est neque arca,
quam sic te sineres ab illo amari.
'qui? non est homo bellus?' inquies. est:
sed bello huic neque servus est neque arca.
hoc tu quam lubet abice elevaque:
nec servum tamen ille habet neque arcam.


XXIV. to Juventius

O, what a flowerlet you are among Juventiuses,
not only of the ones now, but of those that once were
or others that will live in the days to come,
I'd rather you'd given the riches of Midas
to that man, who's got neither a slave nor a strong-box,
than let yourself be loved by him.
'How so? Is he not a handsome man?' you say.  He is:
but this handsome man's got neither a slave nor a strong-box.
Throw this away and make light of it as you please:
but that man's got neither a slave nor a strong-box.
