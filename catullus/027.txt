XXVII. ad pincernam suum

Minister vetuli puer Falerni
inger mi calices amariores,
ut lex Postumiae iubet magistrae
ebrioso acino ebriosioris.
at vos quo lubet hinc abite, lymphae
vini pernicies, et ad severos
migrate. hic merus est Thyonianus.

XXVII. to his cupbearer

Servant boy of aged Falernium
??? to me sad/caustic goblets,
as the law of Mistress Postumia dictates
drunk of the grape and drunker.
But you who it pleases to leave here, water-nymphs
ruins of wine, and to move to stern men.
Here the wine is pure Thyonianus.
