XXVIII. ad Verannium et Fabullum

Pisonis comites, cohors inanis,
aptis sarcinulis et expeditis,
Verani optime tuque mi Fabulle,
quid rerum geritis? satisne cum isto
vappa frigoraque et famem tulistis?
ecquidnam in tabulis patet lucelli
expensum, ut mihi, qui meum secutus
praetorem refero datum lucello?
"o Memmi, bene me ac diu supinum
tota ista trabe lentus irrumasti."
sed, quantum video, pari fuistis
casu: nam nihilo minore verpa
farti estis. pete nobiles amicos!
at vobis mala multa di deaeque
dent, opprobria Romuli Remique.


XXVIII. to Veranius and Fabullus

Piso's retinue, petty attendants,
with a knapsack tied on and set right,
you Veranius, the best, and my Fabullus,
how goes it with you?  Isn't it enough 
that you bring winter frosts and hunger 
with that good-for-nothing of yours?
For is any slim profit at all laid out in your account books,
when for me, when I followed my own
governor, I made a bit on it?
"O Memmii, you have screwed me, bent over backwards, 
long and hard with the full length of your shaft."
But, as I see it, you both were equal to me
in prospects: indeed, with no small woody
have you been rammed.  Entreat your noble friends!
But may the gods and goddesses give them many woes,
the disgrace of Romulus and Remus.
