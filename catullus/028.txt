XXVIII. ad Verannium et Fabullum

Pisonis comites, cohors inanis,
aptis sarcinulis et expeditis,
Verani optime tuque mi Fabulle,
quid rerum geritis? satisne cum isto
vappa frigoraque et famem tulistis?
ecquidnam in tabulis patet lucelli
expensum, ut mihi, qui meum secutus
praetorem refero datum lucello?
o Memmi, bene me ac diu supinum
tota ista trabe lentus irrumasti.
sed, quantum video, pari fuistis
casu: nam nihilo minore verpa
farti estis. pete nobiles amicos!
at vobis mala multa di deaeque
dent, opprobria Romuli Remique.


XXVIII. to Veranius and Fabullus

Comrades of Piso, foolish attendants,
with a prepared packed attached,
Veranius most well you to me Fabullus,
what sorts of things do you carry?  Is it not enough with that (of yours)
good-for-nothing/stale wine and winter frosts and hunger you bring?
for at all? in a writing tablet the expenditure of petty gain
lies open, so that to me, who followed my 
praetor I give back the petty gift?
O Memmius, well by me and for a long time flat on my back
with that whole log of yours you have forced oral sex.
But, as far as I see it, you both were equals
in the fall/by chance: for by/to nothing less than a boner
you have been stuffed.  Ask your noble friends?
But may the gods and goddesses give to you many evil things,
the shame of Romulus and Remus.
