XXIX. in Romulum cathamitum 

Quis hoc potest videre, quis potest pati,
nisi impudicus et vorax et aleo,
Mamurram habere quod Comata Gallia
habebat uncti et ultima Britannia?
cinaede Romule haec videbis et feres?
et ille nunc superbus et superfluens
perambulabit omnium cubilia,
ut albulus columbus aut Adoneus?
cinaede Romule, haec videbis et feres?
es impudicus et vorax et aleo.

XXIX. in Romulus' ?????

Whoever can see this, whoever can suffer,
if not shameless and voracious and a gambler,
To have Mamurra that Leafy Gaul had
,anointed, and farthest Britain?
Romulus' sodomite, you'll see these things and speak of them?
and he/that now overbearing and overflowing
will make the round of everyone's bed,
as the pale dove or Adonus?
Romulus' sodomite, you'll see these things and speak of them?
You are shameless and voracious and a gambler.
