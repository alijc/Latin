XXIX. in Romulum cathamitum 

Quis hoc potest videre, quis potest pati,
nisi impudicus et vorax et aleo,
Mamurram habere quod Comata Gallia
habebat uncti et ultima Britannia?
cinaede Romule haec videbis et feres?
et ille nunc superbus et superfluens
perambulabit omnium cubilia,
ut albulus columbus aut Adoneus?
cinaede Romule, haec videbis et feres?
es impudicus et vorax et aleo.

XXIX. on Romulus the catamite

Who can see this, who can endure
(if he's not shameless and voracious and a gambler)
that Mamurra's got what long-haired Gaul 
once had, and far off Britain too?
Depraved Romulus, will you see these things and bear them?
And he, now overbearing and overflowing,
will make the rounds of everyone's bed,
like a pale dove or an Adonis?
Depraved Romulus, will you see these things and bear them?
You are shameless and voracious and a gambler.

eone nomine, imperator unice,
fuisti in ultima occidentis insula,
ut ista vestra diffututa mentula
ducenties comesset aut trecenties?
quid est alid sinistra liberalitas?
parum expatravit an parum elluatus est?
paterna prima lancinata sunt bona,
secunda praeda Pontica, inde tertia
Hibera, quam scit amnis aurifer Tagus:
nunc Galliae timetur et Britanniae.
quid hunc malum fovetis? aut quid hic potest
nisi uncta devorare patrimonia?
eone nomine urbis opulentissime
socer generque, perdidistis omnia? 

On this account, singular commander-in-chief,
you were on the far western island, 
so that with that whoring prick of yours
you might eat up 200 or 300 times over?
What is another, left-handed generousity?

Isn't it enought that you've finished off or squandered?
First off, your father's good things were torn asunder,
next, the Pontic pillage, thirdly thence
Spain, that the gold-bearing river Tagus knows:
now he is feared by the Gauls and Brittons.

Why do you favor this scumbag?  What is he good for,
except to devour his anointed inheritance?
On his account, the richest men of the city
father-in-law and son-in-law, you have both destroyed everything?
