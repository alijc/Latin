XXX. ad Alphenum

Alfene immemor atque unanimis false sodalibus,
iam te nil miseret, dure, tui dulcis amiculi?
iam me prodere, iam non dubitas fallere, perfide?
nec facta impia fallacum hominum caelicolis placent.
quae tu neglegis ac me miserum deseris in malis.
eheu quid faciant, dic, homines cuive habeant fidem?
certe tute iubebas animam tradere, inique, me
inducens in amorem, quasi tuta omnia mi forent.
idem nunc retrahis te ac tua dicta omnia factaque
ventos irrita ferre ac nebulas aereas sinis.
si tu oblitus es, at di meminerunt, meminit Fides,
quae te ut paeniteat postmodo facti faciet tui.


XXX. to Afenus

Aphenus, forgetful and false to like-minded chums,
even now does nothing grieve you, you cad, about your 'sweet friend'?
Even now do you stick to betray me, even now to trip me up, you turncoat?
And yet the wicked deeds of deceitful men give no pleasure to the deities.
You disregard them and forsake my wretched self to calamities.
Tell me, alas, what men are to do, or in whom they should trust?
Surely you commanded me to securely surrender my soul, you crook,
leading me to love, as if everything would be safely mine.
All the same you now hang back, and allow all your trifling 
words and deeds to drive the winds and airy clouds away.
Even if you have forgotten, the gods have remembered, Faith has remembered,
and she will make you rue your deeds, later.
