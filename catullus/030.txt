XXX. ad Alphenum

Alfene immemor atque unanimis false sodalibus,
iam te nil miseret, dure, tui dulcis amiculi?
iam me prodere, iam non dubitas fallere, perfide?
nec facta impia fallacum hominum caelicolis placent.
quae tu neglegis ac me miserum deseris in malis.
eheu quid faciant, dic, homines cuive habeant fidem?
certe tute iubebas animam tradere, inique, me
inducens in amorem, quasi tuta omnia mi forent.
idem nunc retrahis te ac tua dicta omnia factaque
ventos irrita ferre ac nebulas aereas sinis.
si tu oblitus es, at di meminerunt, meminit Fides,
quae te ut paeniteat postmodo facti faciet tui.


XXX. to Aphenus

Forgetful Aphenus, and by/to falsely harmonious companions,
even now nothing grieves you, sternly, of your sweet little friend?
to produce me already/even now, even now do you not doubt to fall, faithless
man?
And not wicked deeds of deceitful men give pleasure to the deities.
The things that you are neglecting and you desert poor me among evil men.
Alas! what they would do, say, the men or to whom would have faith?
Certainly you commanded me without danger to surrender soul, unjustly
leading into love, as if everything would be safe for me.
Likewise now you bring me back and all your words are done
useless (words) made wind and you allow bronze-colored clouds.
If you have forgotten, but the gods remembered, Faith has remembered,
who will afterwords make you regret your deeds.
