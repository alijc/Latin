XXX. ad Alphenum

Alfene immemor atque unanimis false sodalibus,
iam te nil miseret, dure, tui dulcis amiculi?
iam me prodere, iam non dubitas fallere, perfide?
nec facta impia fallacum hominum caelicolis placent.
quae tu neglegis ac me miserum deseris in malis.
eheu quid faciant, dic, homines cuive habeant fidem?
certe tute iubebas animam tradere, inique, me
inducens in amorem, quasi tuta omnia mi forent.
idem nunc retrahis te ac tua dicta omnia factaque
ventos irrita ferre ac nebulas aereas sinis.
si tu oblitus es, at di meminerunt, meminit Fides,
quae te ut paeniteat postmodo facti faciet tui.


XXX. to Afenus

Aphenus, negligent and deceitful to companions of one accord,
even now does nothing grieve you, harshly, about your sweet friend?
Even now are you sure to betray me, even now to trip me up, faithless man?
And yet the wicked deeds of deceitful men give no pleasure to the deities.
You disregard them and forsake my wretched self to calamities.
Alas! Tell me, what are men to do, or in whom should they trust?
Surely you safely commanded me to surrender my soul, unjustly,
leading me to love, as if everything would be safe for me.
Likewise now you call me back, and all your words and trifling
deeds you allow to support the winds and airy clouds.
Even if you have forgotten, the gods have remembered, Faith has remembered,
who later will make you rue your deeds.
