XXXI. ad Sirmium insulam

Paene insularum, Sirmio, insularumque
ocelle, quascumque in liquentibus stagnis
marique vasto fert uterque Neptunus,
quam te libenter quamque laetus inviso,
vix mi ipse credens Thuniam atque Bithunos
liquisse campos et videre te in tuto.
o quid solutis est beatius curis,
cum mens onus reponit, ac peregrino
labore fessi venimus larem ad nostrum,
desideratoque acquiescimus lecto?
hoc est quod unum est pro laboribus tantis.
salve, o venusta Sirmio, atque ero gaude
gaudente, vosque, o Lydiae lacus undae,
ridete quidquid est domi cachinnorum.

XXXI. to the Isle of Sirmio

Nearly an island, O Sirmio, and of islands
the gem, whichever of them in clear lagoons
and in the vast sea both Neptune brings/gets/makes,
how much/as I, joyful, gladly look at you each,
scarcely believing that the Thynians and Bithynians
leave behind the fields and see you in safety.
O who is happier than those freed from cares,
while the mind lays down its burden, and from foreign
labor we, wearied, come to our hearth,
and repose on our longed for bed?
It is that one thing is for such labors.
Hail, O lovely Sirmio, and rejoice for your rejoicing
master, and y'all, O Lydian waves of the lake,
laugh whatever/each one is at home of the splashes.
