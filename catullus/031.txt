XXXI. ad Sirmium insulam

Paene insularum, Sirmio, insularumque
ocelle, quascumque in liquentibus stagnis
marique vasto fert uterque Neptunus,
quam te libenter quamque laetus inviso,
vix mi ipse credens Thuniam atque Bithunos
liquisse campos et videre te in tuto.
o quid solutis est beatius curis,
cum mens onus reponit, ac peregrino
labore fessi venimus larem ad nostrum,
desideratoque acquiescimus lecto?
hoc est quod unum est pro laboribus tantis.
salve, o venusta Sirmio, atque ero gaude
gaudente, vosque, o Lydiae lacus undae,
ridete quidquid est domi cachinnorum.

XXXI. to the Isle of Sirmius???

Almost of islands, O Sirmius, and of islands
the darling, and whichever in liquid lagoons
and in the vast sea both Neptune brings/gets/makes,
than/how/as I freely visit you and than/how/as lush,
scarcely believing that Thunia and Bithunuses
to be liquid fields and to see you in safety.
O what is more fortunate for those free of cares/office,
while the mind restores its burden, and to/by the foreign/exotic
labor we, wearied, come to our Lares,
and lie down on our longed for bed?
It is because one thing is for such labors.
Hail, O lovely Sirmius, and I will be (be glad!)
by rejoicing, and y'all, O Lydian waves of the lake,
laugh whatever/each one is home with a guffaw.
