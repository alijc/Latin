XXXII. ad Ipsicillam

Amabo, mea dulcis Ipsitilla,
meae deliciae, mei lepores,
iube ad te veniam meridiatum.
et si iusseris, illud adiuvato,
ne quis liminis obseret tabellam,
neu tibi lubeat foras abire,
sed domi maneas paresque nobis
novem continuas fututiones.
verum si quid ages, statim iubeto:
nam pransus iaceo et satur supinus
pertundo tunicamque palliumque.

XXXII. to Ipsitilla

Please, my delightful Ipsitilla,
my darling, my charmer,
command me to come to you at noon.
And if you so command, then encourage/help/aid/abet it,
so that none of the house/threshold bar a writing tablet,
and/or it pleases you not to go outside,
but at home you bide and prepare for us
nine continuous fucks.
In truth, if you do anything, command it at once:
for I'm lying at breakfast/lunch and am well-fed, flat on my back
having torn through both tunic and cloak.
