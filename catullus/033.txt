XXXIII. ad Vibennios

O Furum optime balneariorum
Vibenni pater et cinaede fili
(nam dextra pater inquinatiore,
culo filius est voraciore),
cur non exilium malasque in oras
itis? quandoquidem patris rapinae
notae sunt populo, et natis pilosas,
fili, non potes asse venditare.


XXXIII. to the Vibennians???

O you best of bathhouse thieves
father of Vibennius??? and sodomite of the son
(for the father by the more defiled right hand,
the son is by the more voracious buttocks),
why are you two going into banishment and onto evil shores?
Seeing that the robberies of the father 
are well known to the people, and to hairy daughters,
o son, you cannot sell a penny.
