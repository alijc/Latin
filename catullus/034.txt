XXXIV. carmen Dianae

Dianae sumus in fide
puellae et pueri integri:
Dianam pueri integri
puellaeque canamus.

o Latonia, maximi
magna progenies Iovis,
quam mater prope Deliam
deposiuit olivam,

montium domina ut fores
silvarumque virentium
saltuumque reconditorum
amniumque sonantum:

tu Lucina dolentibus
Iuno dicta puerperis,
tu potens Trivia et notho es
dicta lumine Luna.

tu cursu, dea, menstruo
metiens iter annuum,
rustica agricolae bonis
tecta frugibus exples.

sis quocumque tibi placet
sancta nomine, Romulique,
antique ut solita es, bona
sospites ope gentem.


XXXIV. song/prayer to Diana

In faith we're for Diana 
all the lads and lasses:
all the lads and lasses
celebrate Diana.

O Latonia, the great offspring
of most great Jove,
how her mother near Delos
planted an olive tree,

so that you were/became mistress of the mountains
and of the green forests
and of the hidden glades
and of the echoing streams:

you by Lucina (all) suffering pain
Juno having spoken to the women in labor,
you are mighty Trivia, and born out of wedlock
the moon spoken by the light.

You, goddess, by the monthly course
that measures the journey of the year,
the farmer's wife
you fill the barns with good crops.

May you be wherever it pleases you
by the sacred name, and of Romulus,
as in old times, as was your wont, fair one
preserve the people with your aid.
