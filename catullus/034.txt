XXXIV. carmen Dianae

Dianae sumus in fide
puellae et pueri integri:
Dianam pueri integri
puellaeque canamus.

o Latonia, maximi
magna progenies Iovis,
quam mater prope Deliam
deposiuit olivam,

montium domina ut fores
silvarumque virentium
saltuumque reconditorum
amniumque sonantum:

tu Lucina dolentibus
Iuno dicta puerperis,
tu potens Trivia et notho es
dicta lumine Luna.

tu cursu, dea, menstruo
metiens iter annuum,
rustica agricolae bonis
tecta frugibus exples.

sis quocumque tibi placet
sancta nomine, Romulique,
antique ut solita es, bona
sospites ope gentem.


XXXIV. song/prayer to Diana

We are for Diana in fidelity
all the lads and lasses:
all the lads and lasses
celebrate Diana.

O LatoniaSSS, the greatest 
(great) descendents of Jove,
than mother near Delia
pulled down/planted an olive tree,

mistress of the mountains so that you were
of the forests and of the plants
and of the hidden glades
and of the echoing streams:

you by Lucina (all) suffering pain
Juno having spoken to the women in labor,
you are powerful by the crossroads and illegitimate
the light of the moon having said.

You, hastening, goddess, by the month
measuring the yearly journey,
the countrywoman to the farmer
you fill the barm with good crops.

May you be wherever it pleases you
by the sacred name, and Romulans,
in the old-fashioned way, as you were used to, good one
that you might preserve the nations with power.
