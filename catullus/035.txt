XXXV. ad Caecilium iubet libello loqui

Poetae tenero, meo sodali,
velim Caecilio, papyre, dicas
Veronam veniat, Noui relinquens
Comi moenia Lariumque litus.
nam quasdam volo cogitationes
amici accipiat sui meique.
quare, si sapiet, viam vorabit,
quamvis candida milies puella
euntem revocet, manusque collo
ambas iniciens roget morari.
quae nunc, si mihi vera nuntiantur,
illum deperit impotente amore.
nam quo tempore legit incohatam
Dindymi dominam, ex eo misellae
ignes interiorem edunt medullam.
ignosco tibi, Sapphica puella
musa doctior; est enim venuste
Magna Caecilio incohata Mater.

XXXV. to Caecilius, he orders to speak by the small book

To the tender poet, my companian,
I'd wish you'd speak to Caecilius, paper,
that it might come to Verona, leaving the ??? behind
the walls of Com?? and the shore of Lari???.

For I want some thoughts/reflections
let it accept of your friend and mine.

Why, if it understands, it will devour the road,
although the fair lass 1000 times
might call the going thing back, and a hand/fist to/by the neck
hurling both it might beg a reprieve.

Which things now, if the truth be told (to me),
he is lost to love's abandon.

For at which time, it reads the established
mistress of Dindymius??, out of/from him the wretched woman's
fires consume the inmost marrow.

I forgive you, Sapphican??? lass
most learned muse; for it is gracefully
the Great Mother established to Caecilius????
