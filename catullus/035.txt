XXXV. ad Caecilium iubet libello loqui

Poetae tenero, meo sodali,
velim Caecilio, papyre, dicas
Veronam veniat, Noui relinquens
Comi moenia Lariumque litus.
nam quasdam volo cogitationes
amici accipiat sui meique.
quare, si sapiet, viam vorabit,
quamvis candida milies puella
euntem revocet, manusque collo
ambas iniciens roget morari.
quae nunc, si mihi vera nuntiantur,
illum deperit impotente amore.
nam quo tempore legit incohatam
Dindymi dominam, ex eo misellae
ignes interiorem edunt medullam.
ignosco tibi, Sapphica puella
musa doctior; est enim venuste
Magna Caecilio incohata Mater.

XXXV. to Caecilius, whom he commands to speak with a pamphlet

O paper, I wish you'd tell the tender poet,
my comrade Caecilius, 
to come to Verona, leaving behind
the walls of New Comum and the shores of Larius.
For I wish that he would undertake 
some deliberations with a friend of yours and mine.
Why, if he has sense, he'll devour the road,
even though the fair lass might call
the traveller back a thousand times, and putting 
both hands on his neck, might beg him to delay.
Who now, if the truth be told to me,
is dying for him in helpless love.
For from the time that she read the rough draft
of the Lady of Dindymus, the wretched woman's
fires consume his inmost marrow.
I forgive you, wiser than the lady muse Sappho;
for it is gracefully
the Great Mother unfinished by Caecilius.
