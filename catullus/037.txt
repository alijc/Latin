XXXVII. ad contubernales et Egnatium

Salax taberna vosque contubernales,
a pilleatis nona fratribus pila,
solis putatis esse mentulas vobis,
solis licere, quidquid est puellarum,
confutuere et putare ceteros hircos?
an, continenter quod sedetis insulsi
centum an ducenti, non putatis ausurum
me una ducentos irrumare sessores?
atqui putate: namque totius vobis
frontem tabernae sopionibus scribam.
puella nam mi, quae meo sinu fugit,
amata tantum quantum amabitur nulla,
pro qua mihi sunt magna bella pugnata,
consedit istic. hanc boni beatique
omnes amatis, et quidem, quod indignum est,
omnes pusilli et semitarii moechi;
tu praeter omnes une de capillatis,
cuniculosae Celtiberiae fili,
Egnati. opaca quem bonum facit barba
et dens Hibera defricatus urina.

XXXVII. to comrades-in-arms and Egnatius

Raunchy beer joint and you messmates,
by the ninth pillar of the felt-capped Twins,
do you think that you alone have pricks,
and you alone have leave, whichever lass,
to fuck and think the rest are goats?
Or, because you sit, one or two hundred,
like bumps on a log, do you think I'd not be bold enough
to screw two hundred loafers at one go?
And yet think: for I'll draw pictures of cocks
all over the your joint's front wall.
For my lass, who fled my lap,
so deeply loved by me as none will be loved,
she, for whom I waged great wars,
sat down by you.  You good and happy men
all love her, and in fact, which is a shame,
all the triflers and back-alley lechers;
And you besides, one of the long-haired boys,
of rabbit-ridden Celtiberia the son,
Egnatius.  Who is made honorable by a dusky beard
and teeth scoured with Spanish piss.
