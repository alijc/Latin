XXXVII. ad contubernales et Egnatium

Salax taberna vosque contubernales,
a pilleatis nona fratribus pila,
solis putatis esse mentulas vobis,
solis licere, quidquid est puellarum,
confutuere et putare ceteros hircos?
an, continenter quod sedetis insulsi
centum an ducenti, non putatis ausurum
me una ducentos irrumare sessores?
atqui putate: namque totius vobis
frontem tabernae sopionibus scribam.
puella nam mi, quae meo sinu fugit,
amata tantum quantum amabitur nulla,
pro qua mihi sunt magna bella pugnata,
consedit istic. hanc boni beatique
omnes amatis, et quidem, quod indignum est,
omnes pusilli et semitarii moechi;
tu praeter omnes une de capillatis,
cuniculosae Celtiberiae fili,
Egnati. opaca quem bonum facit barba
et dens Hibera defricatus urina.

XXXVII. to comrades-in-arms and Egnatius???

O, lusty inn and you, my tent-mates,
by/from nine brothers in liberty caps ball/javelins,
(by the ground/of the sun) you think that your pricks are yours (alone?)
solely to bid at auction, whatever is of the lasses,
to fuck and think the others goats?
Or, because you sit continually stupid
one hundred or two, you don't think he/it needs to act boldly
by me one (woman) to skull-fuck two hundred residents/riders/sitters?
But think: for an in fact of all to you
I'll write the front of the inn with cocks.
For the lass for me, who flees my lap,
the beloved so very much will be loved by none,
for whom to me did great battles rage,
he took up a position over there.  This (woman) the good and happy (men)
all by the beloved (ones), and indeed, because he is unworthy,
every petty (one) and lesser of the footpaths adulterer;
Besides, you, one of the long-haired boys to all,
to the rabbit-ridden Celtiberia of the son of 
Egnatius.  Shade any good man who fashions a beard
and, gone from Hibera, and scoured, dive into water.
