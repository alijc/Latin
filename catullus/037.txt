XXXVII. ad contubernales et Egnatium

Salax taberna vosque contubernales,
a pilleatis nona fratribus pila,
solis putatis esse mentulas vobis,
solis licere, quidquid est puellarum,
confutuere et putare ceteros hircos?
an, continenter quod sedetis insulsi
centum an ducenti, non putatis ausurum
me una ducentos irrumare sessores?
atqui putate: namque totius vobis
frontem tabernae sopionibus scribam.
puella nam mi, quae meo sinu fugit,
amata tantum quantum amabitur nulla,
pro qua mihi sunt magna bella pugnata,
consedit istic. hanc boni beatique
omnes amatis, et quidem, quod indignum est,
omnes pusilli et semitarii moechi;
tu praeter omnes une de capillatis,
cuniculosae Celtiberiae fili,
Egnati. opaca quem bonum facit barba
et dens Hibera defricatus urina.

XXXVII. to comrades-in-arms and Egnatius???

The lecherous shop and you messmates,
from the felt-capped Twins by the ninth pillar of the Twins temple?,
(by the ground/of the sun) you think that your pricks are yours (alone?)
solely/of the sun to bid at auction/to be allowed, whatever it is of the lasses,
to fuck and think the others goats?
Or, because you sit continually stupid/tasteless/insipid
one hundred or two, you don't think that the one about to act boldly
by me one (woman) to skull-fuck two hundred spectators?
But think: for and in fact of all (of her) to/by you
I'll draw cocks on the facade of the shop.
For the lass for me, who flees my lap,
so deeply loved will be loved by none,
for whom to me did great battles rage,
he sat down/took up a position over there.  You good and happy men
all love her, and indeed, because it is unworthy,
all the triflers and back-alley lechers;
Besides, you, one of the long-haired boys to all,
to the rabbit-ridden Celtiberia of the son of 
Egnatius.  Shade any good man who fashions a beard
and, like in Spain, rubbed with piss.
