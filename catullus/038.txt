XXXVIII. ad Cornificium

Malest, Cornifici, tuo Catullo
malest, me hercule, et laboriose,
et magis magis in dies et horas.
quem tu, quod minimum facillimumque est,
qua solatus es allocutione?
irascor tibi. sic meos amores?
paulum quid lubet allocutionis,
maestius lacrimis Simonideis.

XXXVIII. to Cornificius

Vile man, Cornificius, to your Catullus
vile, me, by Hercules, and painstakingly,
and to wise men by wise men into days and hours.
whom do you, because is it easiest and cheapest,
by which consolation did you comfort?
I'm angry with you.  Thus to my loves?
The little that it pleases of comforts,
sadder than the tears of Simonides.
