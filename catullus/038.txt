XXXVIII. ad Cornificium

Malest, Cornifici, tuo Catullo
malest, me hercule, et laboriose,
et magis magis in dies et horas.
quem tu, quod minimum facillimumque est,
qua solatus es allocutione?
irascor tibi. sic meos amores?
paulum quid lubet allocutionis,
maestius lacrimis Simonideis.

XXXVIII. to Cornificius

It's dire, Cornificius, for your Catullus,
It's dire for me, by Hercules, and rough,
and more and more so each day and hour.
Whom you did, since it's such a small and easy thing,
solace with such consoling words?
I'm angry with you.  Thus to my loves?
The little that is pleasing of consoling words,
sadder than Simonides' tears.
