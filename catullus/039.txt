XXXIX. ad Egnatium

Egnatius, quod candidos habet dentes,
renidet usque quaque. si ad rei ventum est
subsellium, cum orator excitat fletum,
renidet ille; si ad pii rogum fili
lugetur, orba cum flet unicum mater,
renidet ille. quidquid est, ubicumque est,
quodcumque agit, renidet: hunc habet morbum,
neque elegantem, ut arbitror, neque urbanum.
quare monendum est te mihi, bone Egnati.
si urbanus esses aut Sabinus aut Tiburs
aut pinguis Vmber aut obesus Etruscus
aut Lanuvinus ater atque dentatus
aut Transpadanus, ut meos quoque attingam,
aut quilubet, qui puriter lavit dentes,
tamen renidere usque quaque te nollem:
nam risu inepto res ineptior nulla est.
nunc Celtiber es: Celtiberia in terra,
quod quisque minxit, hoc sibi solet mane
dentem atque russam defricare gingivam,
ut quo iste vester expolitior dens est,
hoc te amplius bibisse praedicet loti.

XXXIX. to Egnatius

Egnatius, because he has white teeth,
he gleams, everywhere and always.  If a case is brought
to the bench, while the orator arouses tears,
he gleams; If at a funeral pyre where a dearly departed son
is mourned, while the bereft mother weeps for her only child,
he gleams.  Whatever he is, wherever he is,
whatever he does, he gleams: he has this disorder,
neither elegant, as I observe, nor urbane.
How you ought to be advised by me, good Egnatius.
Whether you were city-bred, or a Sabine or a Tiburtine
or a dull Umberian or a fat Etruscan
or a Lanuvinian, dark and buck-toothed,
or a Transpadanian, to touch on my own people too,
or whoever you please, who cleans his teeth correctly,
but I don't want you to gleam everywhere and always:
for nothing is sillier than silly laughing.
Now you're a Celtiberian: in the land of Celtiberia,
because everyone piddled, is their wont in the morning
to scrub their teeth and their red gums,
so as those teeth of yours are polished more,
it is declared the more that you drank piss.
