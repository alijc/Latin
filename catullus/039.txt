XXXIX. ad Egnatium

Egnatius, quod candidos habet dentes,
renidet usque quaque. si ad rei ventum est
subsellium, cum orator excitat fletum,
renidet ille; si ad pii rogum fili
lugetur, orba cum flet unicum mater,
renidet ille. quidquid est, ubicumque est,
quodcumque agit, renidet: hunc habet morbum,
neque elegantem, ut arbitror, neque urbanum.
quare monendum est te mihi, bone Egnati.
si urbanus esses aut Sabinus aut Tiburs
aut pinguis Vmber aut obesus Etruscus
aut Lanuvinus ater atque dentatus
aut Transpadanus, ut meos quoque attingam,
aut quilubet, qui puriter lavit dentes,
tamen renidere usque quaque te nollem:
nam risu inepto res ineptior nulla est.
nunc Celtiber es: Celtiberia in terra,
quod quisque minxit, hoc sibi solet mane
dentem atque russam defricare gingivam,
ut quo iste vester expolitior dens est,
hoc te amplius bibisse praedicet loti.

XXXIX. to Egnatius

Egnatius, because he has white teeth,
he gleams, everywhere and always.  If a case is brought
to the bench, while the orator arouses tears,
he gleams; If to a blessed dead son's funeral pyre
is mourned, while the bereft mother weeps for her only child,
he gleams.  Whatever it is, wherever it is,
whatever he does, he gleams: he has this disease,
neither elegant, as I observe, nor urbane.
Why ought it be advised by you to me, good Egnatius.
If you were a witty man, either Sabinus or Tiburs
or dull Umber or fat Etruscus
or Lanuvinus, dark and buck-toothed,
or Transpadanus, for me to touch on my own besides,
or whoever you please, who cleans his teeth purely,
but I don't want you to gleam everywhere and always:
for with silly laughing the matter I am played the fool is nothing.
Now you are Celtiber: Celtiberia on the land,
because everyone piddled, is their wont in the morning
to scrub the teeth and the red gums,
as by which that there tooth of yours is more polished,
which he would declare that you did drink more piss.
