XL. ad Ravidum

Quaenam te mala mens, miselle Ravide,
agit praecipitem in meos iambos?
quis deus tibi non bene advocatus
vecordem parat excitare rixam?
an ut pervenias in ora vulgi?
quid vis? qualubet esse notus optas?
eris, quandoquidem meos amores
cum longa voluisti amare poena.

XL. to Ravidus

Who/what in the world to/by you an evil mind, wretched Ravidus,
did drive headlong into my meters?
Which god, by you not well invoked,
prepares to raise a frenzied brawl?
Can it be for you to come to the mob's mouths?
What do you want?  However you please you choose to be known?
You will, since my loves
while long you have wished to love pain.
