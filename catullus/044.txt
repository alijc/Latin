XLIV. ad Fundum

O Funde noster seu Sabine seu Tiburs
(nam te esse Tiburtem autumant, quibus non est
cordi Catullum laedere; at quibus cordi est,
quovis Sabinum pignore esse contendunt),
sed seu Sabine sive verius Tiburs,
fui libenter in tua suburbana
villa, malamque pectore expuli tussim,
non inmerenti quam mihi meus venter,
dum sumptuosas appeto, dedit, cenas.
nam, Sestianus dum volo esse conviva,
orationem in Antium petitorem
plenam veneni et pestilentiae legi.
hic me gravedo frigida et frequens tussis
quassavit usque, dum in tuum sinum fugi,
et me recuravi otioque et urtica.
quare refectus maximas tibi grates
ago, meum quod non es ulta peccatum.
nec deprecor iam, si nefaria scripta
Sesti recepso, quin gravedinem et tussim
non mihi, sed ipsi Sestio ferat frigus,
qui tunc vocat me, cum malum librum legi.

XLIV. to the farm

O farm of ours, whether Sabine or Tiburtine,
(for they say you're Tiburtine, those who don't have it in them
to hurt Catullus to the quick; but those who do,
they contend any which way that you're Sabine with a surety),
but, whether Sabine or truly Tiburtine,
I was happily in your suburban
villa, and I drove a bad cough from my chest,
that, not undeservedly, my belly gave me,
as I sought after sumptuous dinners.
For, while I was hoping to be Sestianus' guest,
I read his speech against the claimant Antius
full of venom and of plague.
Then a chilling cold and a constant cough
shook me until I fled to your bosom,
and I cured myself with both rest and stinging nettle.
Therefore, restored, the greatest thanks to you
I give, since you didn't avenge my fault.
And I no longer beg release if execrable writings
I get from Sestius, that not to me a cold and cough, 
but let the chill bear them to Sestius himself,
who then summons me, as I read a bad book.
