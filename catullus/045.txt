XLV. ad Septimium

Acmen Septimius suos amores
tenens in gremio 'mea' inquit 'Acme,
ni te perdite amo atque amare porro
omnes sum assidve paratus annos,
quantum qui pote plurimum perire,
solus in Libya Indiaque tosta
caesio veniam obvius leoni.'
hoc ut dixit, Amor sinistra ut ante
dextra sternuit approbationem.

Acmen Septimius his loves
holding in lap 'my' one says 'Acmen,
unless you ruin yourself I love to love again
all men/things I am continually prepared for (whole) years,
as much as any who can waste the most,
only in parched African and India
hewing I will come exposed to the lion.'
This as he speaks, Love with the left hand as before
he sneezes approval with his right.


     at Acme leviter caput reflectens
et dulcis pueri ebrios ocellos
illo purpureo ore suaviata,
'sic' inquit 'mea vita Septimille,
huic uni domino usque serviamus,
ut multo mihi maior acriorque
ignis mollibus ardet in medullis.'
hoc ut dixit, Amor sinistra ut ante
dextra sternuit approbationem.

But, Acmen, gently turning your head
and the drunken little eyes of the sweet lad
by that purple mouth ????
'thus' one says 'my life, Septimillus,
to this lord of one always we might serve,
in order to by/to much to me greater and more bitter
fire burns in the soft marrow.'
This as he speaks, Love with the left hand as before
he sneezes approval with his right.


     nunc ab auspicio bono profecti
mutuis animis amant amantur.
unam Septimius misellus Acmen
mauult quam Syrias Britanniasque:
uno in Septimio fidelis Acme
facit delicias libidinisque.
quis ullos homines beatiores
vidit, quis Venerem auspicatiorem?

Now by the good omen departed
by/to borrowed/lent minds/souls they love they are loved.
Poor Septimius Acmen one woman
prefers to Syrias and Britains:
By/to one Septimius Acmen into faith/trusts 
makes a pet and of desire.
Who saw any men happier,
who hallowed Venus.
