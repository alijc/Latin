XLV. ad Septimium

Acmen Septimius suos amores
tenens in gremio 'mea' inquit 'Acme,
ni te perdite amo atque amare porro
omnes sum assidve paratus annos,
quantum qui pote plurimum perire,
solus in Libya Indiaque tosta
caesio veniam obvius leoni.'
hoc ut dixit, Amor sinistra ut ante
dextra sternuit approbationem.

     at Acme leviter caput reflectens
et dulcis pueri ebrios ocellos
illo purpureo ore suaviata,
'sic' inquit 'mea vita Septimille,
huic uni domino usque serviamus,
ut multo mihi maior acriorque
ignis mollibus ardet in medullis.'
hoc ut dixit, Amor sinistra ut ante
dextra sternuit approbationem.

     nunc ab auspicio bono profecti
mutuis animis amant amantur.
unam Septimius misellus Acmen
mauult quam Syrias Britanniasque:
uno in Septimio fidelis Acme
facit delicias libidinisque.
quis ullos homines beatiores
vidit, quis Venerem auspicatiorem?




XLV. to Septimius

Septimus, holding his lover Acme in his lap,
Says 'my Acme, unless I love thee to destruction
And am prepared in all the years to come 
To love thee constantly 
as much as one who can most perish, 
Alone in parched Africa or India
I'll come by cutting to meet the lion. '
As he so says, Love, with his left hand as before,
Sneezes approval with his right. 

But, Acme, gently turning her head
and her swimming little eyes of the sweet lad
by that dark red mouth ????
'thus' she says  'Septimillus my life,
May we always serve this lord of one,
As much more or sharper
fire burns in the soft marrow.'
As he so says, Love, with his left hand as before,
Sneezes approval with his right.

Now by the good omen departed
by/to borrowed souls they love they are loved.
Wretched Septimius prefers a single Acme
 to Syrias and Britains:
For a single  Septimius Acme in faith
makes a pet even of desire.
Who saw anyone happier,
who hallowed Venus.
