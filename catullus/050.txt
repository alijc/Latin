L. ad Lucinium

Hesterno, Licini, die otiosi
multum lusimus in meis tabellis,
ut convenerat esse delicatos:
scribens versiculos uterque nostrum
ludebat numero modo hoc modo illoc,
reddens mutua per iocum atque vinum.
atque illinc abii tuo lepore
incensus, Licini, facetiisque,
ut nec me miserum cibus iuvaret
nec somnus tegeret quiete ocellos,
sed toto indomitus furore lecto
versarer, cupiens videre lucem,
ut tecum loquerer, simulque ut essem.
at defessa labore membra postquam
semimortua lectulo iacebant,
hoc, iucunde, tibi poema feci,
ex quo perspiceres meum dolorem.
nunc audax cave sis, precesque nostras,
oramus, cave despuas, ocelle,
ne poenas Nemesis reposcat a te.
est vehemens dea: laedere hanc caveto.

On yesterday, Licinius, a day of rest
we played a lot on my writing tablet,
while it had convened to be paramours:
writing verses and which of our
was playing quickly in this way to there,
returning borrowed things through a joke and wine.
And in there I departed from your charm
fired, Licinius, and by jokes,
so that he/it neither might help wretched me
nor sleep cover darling eyes with rest,
but untamed by all chosen fury 
I might spin, longing to see the light of day,
to speak with you, and at the same time to be.
But limbs worn out with toil after
???? by couch they lie down,
to you, buddy, I've made this poem,
from which you see through my pain.
Now let you be bold, take care, and our prayers,
we pray, take care may you spit/spurn, my darling,
lest Nemesis demands her revenge of you.
She's a severe goddess: you should be careful not to offend her.
