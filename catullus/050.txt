L. ad Lucinium

Hesterno, Licini, die otiosi
multum lusimus in meis tabellis,
ut convenerat esse delicatos:
scribens versiculos uterque nostrum
ludebat numero modo hoc modo illoc,
reddens mutua per iocum atque vinum.
atque illinc abii tuo lepore
incensus, Licini, facetiisque,
ut nec me miserum cibus iuvaret
nec somnus tegeret quiete ocellos,
sed toto indomitus furore lecto
versarer, cupiens videre lucem,
ut tecum loquerer, simulque ut essem.
at defessa labore membra postquam
semimortua lectulo iacebant,
hoc, iucunde, tibi poema feci,
ex quo perspiceres meum dolorem.
nunc audax cave sis, precesque nostras,
oramus, cave despuas, ocelle,
ne poenas Nemesis reposcat a te.
est vehemens dea: laedere hanc caveto.

Yesterday, Licinius, on a day of leisure
we greatly amused ourselves on my writing tablets,
as we agreed to write love poems:
writing verses and whichever of ours
played several rounds here and there,
returning borrowed lines in jest and in wine.
And I left there aglow with your charm, 
Licinius, and with your wit,
so that no food could aid poor wretched me
nor sleep cover my eyes with rest,
but wild with passion from my whole bed
I turn, longing to see the light of day,
to speak with you, and to be with you.
But limbs half-dead and worn with toil
after they collapse onto my couch,
for you, buddy, I've made this poem,
from which you might behold my pain.
Now beware being haughty, and say our prayers,
take care not to spit, my dear,
lest Nemesis demands her revenge of you.
She's a severe goddess: you must take care not to offend her.
