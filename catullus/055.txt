LV. ad Camerium

Oramus, si forte non molestum est,
demonstres ubi sint tuae tenebrae.
te Campo quaesivimus minore,
te in Circo, te in omnibus libellis,
te in templo summi Iovis sacrato.
in Magni simul ambulatione
femellas omnes, amice, prendi,
quas vultu vidi tamen sereno.
avelte, sic ipse flagitabam,
Camerium mihi pessimae puellae.
quaedam inquit, nudum reduc...
'en hic in roseis latet papillis.'
sed te iam ferre Herculi labos est;
tanto te in fastu negas, amice.
dic nobis ubi sis futurus, ede
audacter, committe, crede luci.
nunc te lacteolae tenent puellae?
si linguam clauso tenes in ore,
fructus proicies amoris omnes.
verbosa gaudet Venus loquella.
vel, si vis, licet obseres palatum,
dum vestri sim particeps amoris.

LV. to Camerius

We pray, if by chance it's not annoying,
that you show where your shadows might be.
We sought you in the lesser Campus???,
in the Circus, in all the pamphlets,
in the temple of highest holy Jove.
In the Great One's likewise promenading
I took all young women, friend,
whom I saw by face, yet with fair weather.
??? thus I entreated myself,
Camerius to my the worst lasses.
Some say: restore the naked...
'Behold, it/he/she lies here in rosy nipples.'
But it is already by you the irons of Hercules' labors;
By/to such you deny in contempt, friend.
Tell us where you might be in the future, kid
boldy, unite, trust in the light.
Now ???? do the lasses hold you?
If you hold your tongue inside your closed mouth,
You'll throw out all of the fruits of love.
Venus rejoices in verbose speech.
Or, if you prefer, although you might sow/bolt taste,
as long as I might be the sharer of your love.
