LIX. in Rufum

Bononiensis Rufa Rufulum fellat,
uxor Meneni, saepe quam in sepulcretis
vidistis ipso rapere de rogo cenam,
cum devolutum ex igne prosequens panem
ab semiraso tunderetur ustore.

Rufulus is getting a blow-job from Rufa,
Menenius' wife, whom you have often seen in the graveyard
snatching her supper from the funeral pyre itself,
when chasing the bread that's rolled out of the fire,
she's beaten by the half-shaved copse-burner.
