LIX. in Rufum

Bononiensis Rufa Rufulum fellat,
uxor Meneni, saepe quam in sepulcretis
vidistis ipso rapere de rogo cenam,
cum devolutum ex igne prosequens panem
ab semiraso tunderetur ustore.

Rufa from Bologna sucks Rufulus,
Menenius' wife, who often in the graveyard
y'all have seen snatching her supper from the funeral pyre itself,
when sunken back/deprived out of fire pursuing bread
by a half-shaved cremator she is beaten/bruised.
