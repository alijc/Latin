Num te leaena montibus Libystinis
aut Scylla latrans infima inguinum parte
tam mente dura procreavit ac taetra,
ut supplicis vocem in novissimo casu
contemptam haberes, a nimis fero corde?

Were you borne by a lioness from the mountains of Africa
or by Scylla barking from the lowest part of her groin
with such a harsh and ugly mind,
so that you might have contempt for the voice of the supplicant
in his last extremity, with your too savage heart?
