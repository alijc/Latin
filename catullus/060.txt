LX.

Num te leaena montibus Libystinis
aut Scylla latrans infima inguinum parte
tam mente dura procreavit ac taetra,
ut supplicis vocem in novissimo casu
contemptam haberes, a nimis fero corde?

Surely not from you to the mountains of Africa
or the barking Scylla annul you the private parts
so much by a stern and ugly mind he/it has created,
so that you might have the despised voice of the supplicant in the newest/most
recent chance, from a too-savage heart?
