LXI. epythalamius Iunie et Mallii

Collis o Heliconii
cultor, Uraniae genus,
qui rapis teneram ad virum
virginem, o Hymenaee Hymen,
     o Hymen Hymenaee;

cinge tempora floribus
suave olentis amaraci,
flammeum cape laetus, huc
huc veni, niveo gerens
     luteum pede soccum;

excitusque hilari die,
nuptialia concinens
voce carmina tinnula,
pelle humum pedibus, manu
     pineam quate taedam.

namque Iunia Manlio,
qualis Idalium colens
venit ad Phrygium Venus
iudicem, bona cum bona
     nubet alite virgo,

floridis velut enitens
myrtus Asia ramulis
quos Hamadryades deae
ludicrum sibi roscido
     nutriunt umore.

quare age, huc aditum ferens,
perge linquere Thespiae
rupis Aonios specus,
nympha quos super irrigat
     frigerans Aganippe.

ac domum dominam voca
coniugis cupidam novi,
mentem amore revinciens,
ut tenax hedera huc et huc
     arborem implicat errans.

ac domum dominam voca
coniugis cupidam novi,
mentem amore revinciens,
ut tenax hedera huc et huc
     arborem implicat errans

vosque item simul, integrae
virgines, quibus advenit
par dies, agite in modum
dicite, o Hymenaee Hymen,
     o Hymen Hymenaee.

ut libentius, audiens
se citarier ad suum
munus, huc aditum ferat
dux bonae Veneris, boni
     coniugator amoris.

quis deus magis est ama-
tis petendus amantibus?
quem colent homines magis
caelitum, o Hymenaee Hymen,
     o Hymen Hymenaee?

te suis tremulus parens
invocat, tibi virgines
zonula solvunt sinus,
te timens cupida novos
     captat aure maritus.

tu fero iuveni in manus
floridam ipse puellulam
dedis a gremio suae
matris, o Hymenaee Hymen,
     o Hymen Hymenaee.

nil potest sine te Venus,
fama quod bona comprobet,
commodi capere, at potest
te volente. quis huic deo
     compararier ausit?

nulla quit sine te domus
liberos dare, nec parens
stirpe nitier; ac potest
te volente. quis huic deo
     compararier ausit?

quae tuis careat sacris,
non queat dare praesides
terra finibus: at queat
te volente. quis huic deo
     compararier ausit?

claustra pandite ianuae.
virgo adest. viden ut faces
splendidas quatiunt comas?
* * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * 
tardet ingenuus pudor.
quem tamen magis audiens,
flet quod ire necesse est.

flere desine. non tibi Au-
runculeia periculum est,
ne qua femina pulcrior
clarum ab Oceano diem
     uiderit venientem.

talis in vario solet
divitis domini hortulo
stare flos hyacinthinus.
sed moraris, abit dies.
     prodeas nova nupta.

prodeas nova nupta, si
iam videtur, et audias
nostra verba. viden? faces
aureas quatiunt comas:
     prodeas nova nupta.

non tuus levis in mala
deditus vir adultera,
probra turpia persequens,
a tuis teneris volet
     secubare papillis,

lenta sed velut adsitas
vitis implicat arbores,
implicabitur in tuum
complexum. sed abit dies:
     prodeas nova nupta.

o cubile, quod omnibus
* * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * 
     candido pede lecti,

quae tuo veniunt ero,
quanta gaudia, quae vaga
nocte, quae medio die
gaudeat! sed abit dies:
     prodeas nova nupta.

tollite, o pueri, faces:
flammeum video venire.
ite concinite in modum
'io Hymen Hymenaee io,
     io Hymen Hymenaee.' 


LXI. wedding song for Junia and Malius

O you who dwell on Mount Helicon,
Urania's son,
who hurries the tender maiden off
to her husband, o Hymenaeus Hymen,
   o Hymen Hymenaeus;

garland your temples with flowers
scented with sweet majoram,
take the bridal veil, come joyfully here
come here, wearing a muddy slipper
   on your snowy foot;

and roused by the lively day,
singing wedding songs
in a ringing voice,
beat the ground with your feet,
   wave the pine torch with your hand.

For Junia, to Manlius,
just as Venus when tending Idalium
came to see the Phrygian judge, 
a good virgin marries him
   with well winging omens,

like an Asian myrtle
bearing blooming twigs
that the wood-nymphs
in sport nourish for themselves
   with dewy moisture.

Go on, therefore, bearing a visit here,
proceed to quit rocky Thespiae
and the Aonian grottos, and
the nymph who waters them from above
   refreshing Aganippe.

And call the lady home
longing for her new spouse,
binding fast her mind with love,
as the wandering ivy clinging here and there
   weaves around the tree.

And you all likewise, untouched
virgins, to whom is coming
a similar day, come on! in rhythm
chant, O Hymenaeus Hymen,
    o Hymen Hymenaeus.

As more gladly, hearing
that he is urged to his
duty, hither the approach is borne
by the guide of noble Venus, 
    the conjoiner of noble love.

Which god is greater for lovers
who would be desired by lovers?
Whom will the celestial beings
care more for,  O Hymenaeus Hymen,
    o Hymen Hymenaeus?

The trembling parent prays to you 
for his own, for you the maidens
loosen the belt from their bosom,
fearing you the young husband
watches with an eager ear.

You yourself deliver a blossoming lass
from her mother's lap
into the hands of a fierce young man,
 O Hymenaeus Hymen,
    o Hymen Hymenaeus.

Without you, Venus can do nothing
that a good reputation approves of
to seize some advantage, but she can
if you are willing.  Who to this god
    dares to be matched?

Without you, no house can
deliver children, nor can a parent
lean on his offspring; but they can,
if you are willing.  Who to this god
    dares to be matched?

What land would be without your rites
and could not deliver guardians
of its borders: but could,
if you are willing.  Who to this god
    dares to be matched?

Spread the gates of the entrance wide.
The maiden is near. Do you not see as
the torches shake the glittering hair?
*******
...natural modesty would delay her.
Yet hearing more,
she weeps because she needs to go.

Leave off crying.  For you,
Aurunculeia, there is no danger
that a comelier woman
might look at a bright day
coming from the ocean.

In a varigated garden
of such a wealthy lord 
a hyacinth is wont to stand.
But you delay, the day is dying.
    Advance, new bride.

Advance, new bride, if
it now seems, and hear
our words.  Do you not see
the torches shake the golden hair:
    advance, new bride.

START
AJC

Not your smooth-faced husband
 devoted to an evil wanton,
pursuing shameful disgrace,
from your tender teats he'll wish
    to sleep apart,

clinging but just as if planted
vines he interleaves trees,
he'll be interleaved in your 
embrace.  But the day is dying:
    advance new bride.

O bed, that to all men...
...
   of the bridal bed your white foot.

Which come to your master,
so many delights, which in the wandering
night, which at midday
he would rejoice!  But the day is dying:
    advance new bride.

Lift up the torches, lads:
I see the bridal veil coming.
Advance and sing in rhythm
'Hurrah Hymen Hymenaeus hurrah,
  hurrah Hymen Hymenaeus.'
