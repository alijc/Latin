LXI. epythalamius Iunie et Mallii

Collis o Heliconii
cultor, Uraniae genus,
qui rapis teneram ad virum
virginem, o Hymenaee Hymen,
     o Hymen Hymenaee;

cinge tempora floribus
suave olentis amaraci,
flammeum cape laetus, huc
huc veni, niveo gerens
     luteum pede soccum;

excitusque hilari die,
nuptialia concinens
voce carmina tinnula,
pelle humum pedibus, manu
     pineam quate taedam.

namque Iunia Manlio,
qualis Idalium colens
venit ad Phrygium Venus
iudicem, bona cum bona
     nubet alite virgo,

floridis velut enitens
myrtus Asia ramulis
quos Hamadryades deae
ludicrum sibi roscido
     nutriunt umore.

quare age, huc aditum ferens,
perge linquere Thespiae
rupis Aonios specus,
nympha quos super irrigat
     frigerans Aganippe.

ac domum dominam voca
coniugis cupidam novi,
mentem amore revinciens,
ut tenax hedera huc et huc
     arborem implicat errans.

ac domum dominam voca
coniugis cupidam novi,
mentem amore revinciens,
ut tenax hedera huc et huc
     arborem implicat errans

vosque item simul, integrae
virgines, quibus advenit
par dies, agite in modum
dicite, o Hymenaee Hymen,
     o Hymen Hymenaee.

ut libentius, audiens
se citarier ad suum
munus, huc aditum ferat
dux bonae Veneris, boni
     coniugator amoris.

quis deus magis est ama-
tis petendus amantibus?
quem colent homines magis
caelitum, o Hymenaee Hymen,
     o Hymen Hymenaee?

te suis tremulus parens
invocat, tibi virgines
zonula solvunt sinus,
te timens cupida novos
     captat aure maritus.

tu fero iuveni in manus
floridam ipse puellulam
dedis a gremio suae
matris, o Hymenaee Hymen,
     o Hymen Hymenaee.

nil potest sine te Venus,
fama quod bona comprobet,
commodi capere, at potest
te volente. quis huic deo
     compararier ausit?

nulla quit sine te domus
liberos dare, nec parens
stirpe nitier; ac potest
te volente. quis huic deo
     compararier ausit?

quae tuis careat sacris,
non queat dare praesides
terra finibus: at queat
te volente. quis huic deo
     compararier ausit?

claustra pandite ianuae.
virgo adest. viden ut faces
splendidas quatiunt comas?
* * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * 
tardet ingenuus pudor.
quem tamen magis audiens,
flet quod ire necesse est.

flere desine. non tibi Au-
runculeia periculum est,
ne qua femina pulcrior
clarum ab Oceano diem
     uiderit venientem.

talis in vario solet
divitis domini hortulo
stare flos hyacinthinus.
sed moraris, abit dies.
     prodeas nova nupta.

prodeas nova nupta, si
iam videtur, et audias
nostra verba. viden? faces
aureas quatiunt comas:
     prodeas nova nupta.

non tuus levis in mala
deditus vir adultera,
probra turpia persequens,
a tuis teneris volet
     secubare papillis,

lenta sed velut adsitas
vitis implicat arbores,
implicabitur in tuum
complexum. sed abit dies:
     prodeas nova nupta.

o cubile, quod omnibus
* * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * 
     candido pede lecti,

quae tuo veniunt ero,
quanta gaudia, quae vaga
nocte, quae medio die
gaudeat! sed abit dies:
     prodeas nova nupta.

tollite, o pueri, faces:
flammeum video venire.
ite concinite in modum
'io Hymen Hymenaee io,
     io Hymen Hymenaee.' 

ne diu taceat procax
Fescennina iocatio,
nec nuces pueris neget
desertum domini audiens
     concubinus amorem.

da nuces pueris, iners
concubine! satis diu
lusisti nucibus: lubet
iam servire Talasio.
     concubine, nuces da.

sordebant tibi villicae,
concubine, hodie atque heri:
nunc tuum cinerarius
tondet os. miser a miser
     concubine, nuces da.

diceris male te a tuis
unguentate glabris marite
abstinere, sed abstine.
io Hymen Hymenaee io,
     io Hymen Hymenaee.

scimus haec tibi quae licent
sola cognita, sed marito
ista non eadem licent.
io Hymen Hymenaee io,
     io Hymen Hymenaee.

nupta, tu quoque quae tuus
vir petet cave ne neges,
ni petitum aliunde eat.
io Hymen Hymenaee io,
     io Hymen Hymenaee.

en tibi domus ut potens
et beata viri tui,
quae tibi sine serviat
(io Hymen Hymenaee io,
     io Hymen Hymenaee)

usque dum tremulum movens
cana tempus anilitas
omnia omnibus annuit.
io Hymen Hymenaee io,
     io Hymen Hymenaee.

transfer omine cum bono
limen aureolos pedes,
rasilemque subi forem.
io Hymen Hymenaee io,
     io Hymen Hymenaee.

aspice intus ut accubans
vir tuus Tyrio in toro
totus immineat tibi.
io Hymen Hymenaee io,
     io Hymen Hymenaee.

illi non minus ac tibi
pectore uritur intimo
flamma, sed penite magis.
io Hymen Hymenaee io,
     io Hymen Hymenaee.

mitte brachiolum teres,
praetextate, puellulae:
iam cubile adeat viri.
io Hymen Hymenaee io,
     io Hymen Hymenaee.

vos bonae senibus viris
cognitae bene feminae,
collocate puellulam.
io Hymen Hymenaee io,
     io Hymen Hymenaee.

iam licet venias, marite:
uxor in thalamo tibi est,
ore floridulo nitens,
alba parthenice velut
     luteumve papaver.

at, marite, ita me iuvent
caelites, nihilo minus
pulcer es, neque te Venus
neglegit. sed abit dies:
     perge, ne remorare.

non diu remoratus es:
iam venis. bona te Venus
iuuerit, quoniam palam
quod cupis cupis, et bonum
     non abscondis amorem.

ille pulueris Africi
siderumque micantium
subducat numerum prius,
qui vestri numerare vult
     multa milia ludi.

ludite ut lubet, et brevi
liberos date. non decet
tam vetus sine liberis
nomen esse, sed indidem
     semper ingenerari.


LXI. wedding song for Junia and Malius

O you who dwell on Mount Helicon,
Urania's son,
who hurries the tender maiden off
to her husband, o Hymenaeus Hymen,
   o Hymen Hymenaeus;

garland your temples with flowers
scented with sweet majoram,
take the bridal veil, come joyfully here
come here, wearing a muddy slipper
   on your snowy foot;

and roused by the lively day,
singing wedding songs
in a ringing voice,
beat the ground with your feet,
   wave the pine torch with your hand.

For Junia, to Manlius,
just as Venus when tending Idalium
came to see the Phrygian judge, 
a good virgin marries him
   with well winging omens,

like an Asian myrtle
bearing blooming twigs
that the wood-nymphs
in sport nourish for themselves
   with dewy moisture.

Go on, therefore, bearing a visit here,
proceed to quit rocky Thespiae
and the Aonian grottos, and
the nymph who waters them from above
   refreshing Aganippe.

And call the lady home
longing for her new spouse,
binding fast her mind with love,
as the wandering ivy clinging here and there
   weaves around the tree.

And you all likewise, untouched
virgins, to whom is coming
a similar day, come on! in rhythm
chant, O Hymenaeus Hymen,
    o Hymen Hymenaeus.

As more gladly, hearing
that he is urged to his
duty, hither the approach is borne
by the guide of noble Venus, 
    the conjoiner of noble love.

Which god is greater for lovers
who would be desired by lovers?
Whom will the celestial beings
care more for,  O Hymenaeus Hymen,
    o Hymen Hymenaeus?

The trembling parent prays to you 
for his own, for you the maidens
loosen the belt from their bosom,
fearing you the young husband
watches with an eager ear.

You yourself deliver a blossoming lass
from her mother's lap
into the hands of a fierce young man,
 O Hymenaeus Hymen,
    o Hymen Hymenaeus.

Without you, Venus can do nothing
that a good reputation approves of
to seize some advantage, but she can
if you are willing.  Who to this god
    dares to be matched?

Without you, no house can
deliver children, nor can a parent
lean on his offspring; but they can,
if you are willing.  Who to this god
    dares to be matched?

What land would be without your rites
and could not deliver guardians
of its borders: but could,
if you are willing.  Who to this god
    dares to be matched?

Spread the gates of the entrance wide.
The maiden is near. Do you not see as
the torches shake the glittering hair?
*******
...natural modesty would delay her.
Yet hearing more,
she weeps because she needs to go.

Leave off crying.  For you,
Aurunculeia, there is no danger
that a comelier woman
might look at a bright day
coming from the ocean.

In a varigated garden
of such a wealthy lord 
a hyacinth is wont to stand.
But you delay, the day is dying.
    Advance, new bride.

Advance, new bride, if
it now seems, and hear
our words.  Do you not see
the torches shake the golden hair:
    advance, new bride.

Your husband isn't fickle and
given to evil wantonnesses,
pursuing shameful deeds,
from your tender breasts he'll not
    wish to sleep apart,

but like the pliant vine
entangles the nearby trees,
he'll be entangled in your 
embrace.  But the day is dying:
    advance new bride.

O bed, that to all men
...
   by the white foot of the bridal bed.

Which come to your master,
so many delights, in the fleeting
night, at midday
he would rejoice!  But the day is dying:
    advance new bride.

Lift up the torches, lads:
I see the bridal veil coming.
Advance and sing in rhythm
'Hurrah Hymen Hymenaeus hurrah,
  hurrah Hymen Hymenaeus.'

Let the wanton Fescennine jest
not be long silent,
nor let the love-slave, hearing of the
departed love of his master,
   deny nuts to the lads.

Give nuts to the lads, lazy
love-slave!  Long enough
have you played with nuts: it's meet
now to serve Talasius.
   Love-slave, give nuts.

The farmwives seemed mean to you,
love-slave, only yesterday:
now the hair-dresser
cuts your face.  Wretch, oh wretched
   love-slave, give nuts.

You'll be told by your 
smooth women, anointed husband,
to hold yourself back badly, but hold back.
'Hurrah Hymen Hymenaeus hurrah,
  hurrah Hymen Hymenaeus.'

We know that these things are allowed you
alone be known, but to a husband
they're all the same not allowed.
'Hurrah Hymen Hymenaeus hurrah,
  hurrah Hymen Hymenaeus.'

Bride, whatever your man asks, 
take care that you not deny,
lest he be inclined to go elsewhere
'Hurrah Hymen Hymenaeus hurrah,
  hurrah Hymen Hymenaeus.'

Look! your husband's house is
so healthy and happy for you,
let it serve wine bowls to you 
(Hurrah Hymen Hymenaeus hurrah,
  hurrah Hymen Hymenaeus)

until stirring trembling
gray old age 
nods to one and all.
Hurrah Hymen Hymenaeus hurrah,
  hurrah Hymen Hymenaeus.

Carry your golden feet across
the threshold with a good omen,
and enter the polished doorway.
Hurrah Hymen Hymenaeus hurrah,
  hurrah Hymen Hymenaeus.

Look within and let your husband,
reclining on his purple couch,
long for you with all his all.
Hurrah Hymen Hymenaeus hurrah,
  hurrah Hymen Hymenaeus.

For him no less than you
in inmost breast is burning 
the fire of love, but more deep down.
Hurrah Hymen Hymenaeus hurrah,
  hurrah Hymen Hymenaeus.

Young man, release the lass's 
dainty well-turned arm:
Now let her near her husband's bed.
Hurrah Hymen Hymenaeus hurrah,
  hurrah Hymen Hymenaeus.

START
AJC

You good women,
examined by old men,
lay the lass down.
Hurrah Hymen Hymenaeus hurrah,
  hurrah Hymen Hymenaeus.

You may come now, husband:
your wife is in your bedchamber,
glistening with her flowery? mouth,
like a white ???
  or a yellow poppyseed.

But, husband, so that the gods
would help me thus, by nothing less
you are handsome, and Venus does not 
neglect you.  But the day passes:
  go on, don't delay.

You didn't tarry for long:
you're come already.  May good Venus
aid you, since publicly
you desire what you desire, and 
  you don't hide your good love.

Let he of the sand of Africa
and of the twinkling stars 
carry off the earlier number,
[lead the previous melody?],
of whom your man wants to count
  many thousands of games.

Play when you feel like, and shortly
give children.  It isn't right
so old name without children
to be, but from the same place
  always to be implanted.
