LXII. exametrum carmen nuptiale

Vesper adest, iuvenes, consurgite: Vesper Olympo
exspectata diu vix tandem lumina tollit.
surgere iam tempus, iam pinguis linquere mensas,
iam veniet virgo, iam dicetur hymenaeus.
Hymen o Hymenaee, Hymen ades o Hymenaee!

Cernitis, innuptae, iuvenes? consurgite contra;
nimirum Oetaeos ostendit Noctifer ignes.
sic certest; viden ut perniciter exsiluere?
non temere exsiluere, canent quod vincere par est.
Hymen o Hymenaee, Hymen ades o Hymenaee!

non facilis nobis, aequales, palma parata est:
aspicite, innuptae secum ut meditata requirunt.
non frustra meditantur: habent memorabile quod sit;
nec mirum, penitus quae tota mente laborant.
nos alio mentes, alio divisimus aures;
iure igitur vincemur: amat victoria curam.
quare nunc animos saltem convertite vestros;
dicere iam incipient, iam respondere decebit.
Hymen o Hymenaee, Hymen ades o Hymenaee!

LXII. a wedding song in hexameter

Evening's at hand, young men, arise: the evening 
has at last barely raised the long awaited lights in the sky.
Now's the time to rise, now to leave the rich meal,
now the maiden will come, now the wedding song will be sung.
Hymen o Hymenaeus, come Hymen o Hymenaeus!

Single lasses, do you see the lads? Stand up to face them;
without doubt the evening star points out the fires of Mount Oeta.
as it certainly is; don't you see how they nimbly leapt up?
And didn't leap up by chance, they will sing what is fitting to beat.
Hymen o Hymenaeus, come Hymen o Hymenaeus!

Not easily for us, comrades, is the victory palm prepared:
look, the lasses seek among themselves as they practiced.
Not in vain did they ponder: what they have might be memorable;
and it's not strange, they inwardly strive with all their minds.
We some minds, some ears divide;
and so by right we will be beaten: victory loves diligence.
How now, turn your minds back at least;
they'll start to sing now, soon it will be meet to respond.
Hymen o Hymenaeus, come Hymen o Hymenaeus!
