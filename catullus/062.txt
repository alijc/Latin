LXII. exametrum carmen nuptiale

Vesper adest, iuvenes, consurgite: Vesper Olympo
exspectata diu vix tandem lumina tollit.
surgere iam tempus, iam pinguis linquere mensas,
iam veniet virgo, iam dicetur hymenaeus.
Hymen o Hymenaee, Hymen ades o Hymenaee!
Cernitis, innuptae, iuvenes? consurgite contra;
nimirum Oetaeos ostendit Noctifer ignes.
sic certest; viden ut perniciter exsiluere?
non temere exsiluere, canent quod vincere par est.
Hymen o Hymenaee, Hymen ades o Hymenaee!
non facilis nobis, aequales, palma parata est:
aspicite, innuptae secum ut meditata requirunt.
non frustra meditantur: habent memorabile quod sit;
nec mirum, penitus quae tota mente laborant.
nos alio mentes, alio divisimus aures;
iure igitur vincemur: amat victoria curam.
quare nunc animos saltem convertite vestros;
dicere iam incipient, iam respondere decebit.

LXII. some meterical wedding song

Evening's at hand, young people, get ready: the evening to/by Olympus
long awaited light only just at last destroys/raises.
to rise/lift now the time, now the grease to leave the tables/meals,
now will come the maiden, now is said the wedding chant.
Hymen o Hymenaeus, come Hymen o Hymenaeus!

You sift/discern/decide, unwed women, youths? Prepare against;
without doubt Noctifer shows the Oetaeian fires.
so ???; don't you see that ??? to spring forth/leap up?
not rashly to burst forth, they will sing that/because it is equal to conquer .
Hymen o Hymenaeus, come Hymen o Hymenaeus!

Not easy to us, comrades, the palm is prepared:
look, unmarried women with me while they seek pondered matters.
Not in vain are they considered: they have memorable what would be;
and not strange, deep within those work with the whole mind.
We some minds, some ears divide;
by right/law therefore, we will be conquered: victory loves care.
Why now, invert your minds at least;
to say now they will begin already to answere it will be fitting.
