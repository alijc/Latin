LXII. exametrum carmen nuptiale

Vesper adest, iuvenes, consurgite: Vesper Olympo
exspectata diu vix tandem lumina tollit.
surgere iam tempus, iam pinguis linquere mensas,
iam veniet virgo, iam dicetur hymenaeus.
Hymen o Hymenaee, Hymen ades o Hymenaee!

Cernitis, innuptae, iuvenes? consurgite contra;
nimirum Oetaeos ostendit Noctifer ignes.
sic certest; viden ut perniciter exsiluere?
non temere exsiluere, canent quod vincere par est.
Hymen o Hymenaee, Hymen ades o Hymenaee!

non facilis nobis, aequales, palma parata est:
aspicite, innuptae secum ut meditata requirunt.
non frustra meditantur: habent memorabile quod sit;
nec mirum, penitus quae tota mente laborant.
nos alio mentes, alio divisimus aures;
iure igitur vincemur: amat victoria curam.
quare nunc animos saltem convertite vestros;
dicere iam incipient, iam respondere decebit.
Hymen o Hymenaee, Hymen ades o Hymenaee!

LXII. a wedding song in hexameter

Evening's at hand, young men, arise: the evening 
has at last barely raised the long awaited lights in the sky.
Now's the time to rise, now to leave the rich meal,
now the maiden will come, now the wedding song will be sung.
Hymen o Hymenaeus, come Hymen o Hymenaeus!

Hespere, quis caelo fertur crudelior ignis?
qui natam possis complexu avellere matris,
complexu matris retinentem avellere natam,
et iuveni ardenti castam donare puellam.
quid faciunt hostes capta crudelius urbe?
Hymen o Hymenaee, Hymen ades o Hymenaee!

Hespere, quis caelo lucet iucundior ignis?
qui desponsa tua firmes conubia flamma,
quae pepigere viri, pepigerunt ante parentes,
nec iunxere prius quam se tuus extulit ardor.
quid datur a divis felici optatius hora?
Hymen o Hymenaee, Hymen ades o Hymenaee!

Hesperus e nobis, aequales, abstulit unam.
...

Single lasses, do you see the lads? Stand up to face them;
without doubt the evening star points out the fires of Mount Oeta.
as it certainly is; don't you see how they nimbly leapt up?
And didn't leap up by chance, they will sing what is fitting to beat.
Hymen o Hymenaeus, come Hymen o Hymenaeus!

Not easily for us, comrades, is the victory palm prepared:
look, the lasses seek among themselves as they practiced.
Not in vain did they ponder: what they have might be memorable;
and it's not strange, they inwardly strive with all their minds.
We some minds, some ears divide;
and so by right we will be beaten: victory loves diligence.
How now, turn your minds back at least;
they'll start to sing now, soon it will be meet to respond.
Hymen o Hymenaeus, come Hymen o Hymenaeus!

Evening star, what crueler fire is carried through the sky?
How you could wrest a daughter from her mother's embrace,
wrest a daughter from her mother's fast embrace,
and give a chaste lass to a burning young man.
What do enemies so cruelly do with a captured city?
Hymen o Hymenaeus, come Hymen o Hymenaeus!

Evening star, what fairer fire is carried through the sky?
How you might confirm your promised marriage with a flame,
that husbands have settled, as parents have before,
and did not join before your flame carried out.
What is given by the blessed gods more welcome than that hour?
Hymen o Hymenaeus, come Hymen o Hymenaeus!

The evening star, comrades, bears one of our number away...
==================================================
namque tuo adventu vigilat custodia semper,
nocte latent fures, quos idem saepe reuertens,
Hespere, mutato comprendis nomine Eous
at lubet innuptis ficto te carpere questu.
quid tum, si carpunt, tacita quem mente requirunt?
Hymen o Hymenaee, Hymen ades o Hymenaee!

Ut flos in saeptis secretus nascitur hortis,
ignotus pecori, nullo convolsus aratro,
quem mulcent aurae, firmat sol, educat imber;
multi illum pueri, multae optavere puellae:
idem cum tenui carptus defloruit ungui,
nulli illum pueri, nullae optavere puellae:
sic virgo, dum intacta manet, dum cara suis est;
cum castum amisit polluto corpore florem,
nec pueris iucunda manet, nec cara puellis.
Hymen o Hymenaee, Hymen ades o Hymenaee!

...
for by your arrival the guard is ever watchful,
thieves lurk in the night, who often returning again,
O evening star, you embrace the morning star with an altered name
but it pleases the unmarried with the false thing/man to seize you with a gripe.
What then, if they seize, which man do they require with a quiet ming?
Hymen o Hymenaeus, come Hymen o Hymenaeus!

In order for the secret flower to be born in the enfolded garden,
unknown to the flock, by none plowed dislocated,
which the breezes stroke, the sun strengthens, the rain draws up;
Many of those lads, many ??? lasses:
the same while I held the divided/despoiled he unflowered with a claw,
none of those lads, no ??? lasses:
thus a maiden, as long as she remains a virgin, until she is his dear;
while s/he lost by soiled body the virtuous flower,
and not to the lads pleasing remains, and not dear to the lasses.
Hymen o Hymenaeus, come Hymen o Hymenaeus!
