LXII. exametrum carmen nuptiale

Vesper adest, iuvenes, consurgite: Vesper Olympo
exspectata diu vix tandem lumina tollit.
surgere iam tempus, iam pinguis linquere mensas,
iam veniet virgo, iam dicetur hymenaeus.
Hymen o Hymenaee, Hymen ades o Hymenaee!

Cernitis, innuptae, iuvenes? consurgite contra;
nimirum Oetaeos ostendit Noctifer ignes.
sic certest; viden ut perniciter exsiluere?
non temere exsiluere, canent quod vincere par est.
Hymen o Hymenaee, Hymen ades o Hymenaee!

non facilis nobis, aequales, palma parata est:
aspicite, innuptae secum ut meditata requirunt.
non frustra meditantur: habent memorabile quod sit;
nec mirum, penitus quae tota mente laborant.
nos alio mentes, alio divisimus aures;
iure igitur vincemur: amat victoria curam.
quare nunc animos saltem convertite vestros;
dicere iam incipient, iam respondere decebit.
Hymen o Hymenaee, Hymen ades o Hymenaee!

LXII. a wedding song in hexameter

Evening's at hand, young men, arise: the evening 
has at last barely raised the long awaited lights in the sky.
Now's the time to rise, now to leave the rich meal,
now the maiden will come, now the wedding song will be sung.
Hymen o Hymenaeus, come Hymen o Hymenaeus!

Hespere, quis caelo fertur crudelior ignis?
qui natam possis complexu avellere matris,
complexu matris retinentem avellere natam,
et iuveni ardenti castam donare puellam.
quid faciunt hostes capta crudelius urbe?
Hymen o Hymenaee, Hymen ades o Hymenaee!

Hespere, quis caelo lucet iucundior ignis?
qui desponsa tua firmes conubia flamma,
quae pepigere viri, pepigerunt ante parentes,
nec iunxere prius quam se tuus extulit ardor.
quid datur a divis felici optatius hora?
Hymen o Hymenaee, Hymen ades o Hymenaee!

Hesperus e nobis, aequales, abstulit unam.
...

namque tuo adventu vigilat custodia semper,
nocte latent fures, quos idem saepe reuertens,
Hespere, mutato comprendis nomine Eous
at lubet innuptis ficto te carpere questu.
quid tum, si carpunt, tacita quem mente requirunt?
Hymen o Hymenaee, Hymen ades o Hymenaee!

Ut flos in saeptis secretus nascitur hortis,
ignotus pecori, nullo convolsus aratro,
quem mulcent aurae, firmat sol, educat imber;
multi illum pueri, multae optavere puellae:
idem cum tenui carptus defloruit ungui,
nulli illum pueri, nullae optavere puellae:
sic virgo, dum intacta manet, dum cara suis est;
cum castum amisit polluto corpore florem,
nec pueris iucunda manet, nec cara puellis.
Hymen o Hymenaee, Hymen ades o Hymenaee!



Single lasses, do you see the lads? Stand up to face them;
without doubt the evening star points out the fires of Mount Oeta.
as it certainly is; don't you see how they nimbly leapt up?
And didn't leap up by chance, they will sing what is fitting to beat.
Hymen o Hymenaeus, come Hymen o Hymenaeus!

Not easily for us, comrades, is the victory palm prepared:
look, the lasses seek among themselves as they practiced.
Not in vain did they ponder: what they have might be memorable;
and it's not strange, they inwardly strive with all their minds.
We some minds, some ears divide;
and so by right we will be beaten: victory loves diligence.
How now, turn your minds back at least;
they'll start to sing now, soon it will be meet to respond.
Hymen o Hymenaeus, come Hymen o Hymenaeus!

Evening star, what crueler fire is carried through the sky?
How you could wrest a daughter from her mother's embrace,
wrest a daughter from her mother's fast embrace,
and give a chaste lass to a burning young man.
What do enemies so cruelly do with a captured city?
Hymen o Hymenaeus, come Hymen o Hymenaeus!

Evening star, what fairer fire is carried through the sky?
How you might confirm your promised marriage with a flame,
that husbands have settled, as parents have before,
and did not join before your flame carried out.
What is given by the blessed gods more welcome than that hour?
Hymen o Hymenaeus, come Hymen o Hymenaeus!

The evening star, comrades, bears one of our number away...


For a watchful guard is always kept at your approach.
Thieves lurk in the night, often returning again,
O evening star, you catch them with an altered name.
But the single girls are pleased to whine at you with false complaints.
What then, if they whine at him whom they silently look for?
Hymen o Hymenaeus, come Hymen o Hymenaeus!

As a secret flower grows in a walled garden,
unknown to cattle, grubbed up by no plow,
which the breezes stroke, the sun strengthens, the rain draws up;
Those many lads, many lasses have desired:
but when its petals are plucked off with a slender nail,
Those no lads, no lasses have desired:
thus a maiden, while she stays a maid, until then she is dear;
but when she has let the virtuous flower slip from her defiled body,
she is no longer pleasing to the lads, nor dear to the lasses.
Hymen o Hymenaeus, come Hymen o Hymenaeus!

==================================================
Ut vidua in nudo vitis quae nascitur aruo,
numquam se extollit, numquam mitem educat uvam,
sed tenerum prono deflectens pondere corpus
iam iam contingit summum radice flagellum;
hanc nulli agricolae, nulli coluere iuvenci:
at si forte eadem est ulmo coniuncta marito,
multi illam agricolae, multi coluere iuvenci:
sic virgo dum intacta manet, dum inculta senescit;
cum par conubium maturo tempore adepta est,
cara viro magis et minus est invisa parenti.
Hymen o Hymenaee, Hymen ades o Hymenaee!

Et tu ne pugna cum tali coniuge virgo.
non aequom est pugnare, pater cui tradidit ipse,
ipse pater cum matre, quibus parere necesse est.
virginitas non tota tua est, ex parte parentum est,
tertia pars patrest, pars est data tertia matri,
tertia sola tua est: noli pugnare duobus,
qui genero suo iura simul cum dote dederunt.
Hymen o Hymenaee, Hymen ades o Hymenaee!

START
AJC

Like an unwed vine growing in a treeless field,
she never raises herself, never raises a grape,
but bending her tender body with a hanging twisting weight
already now the topmost shoot moistens with the root;
no farmers, no youths tend her:
but if by chance this same one is joined in marriage with an elm,
many farmers, many youths tend her;
so a maiden, while she stays untouched, while she grows old untilled;
while she arrived at an equal marriage in good time,
dear to her husband more and less is unseen with obedience.
Hymen o Hymenaeus, come Hymen o Hymenaeus!

And you, maiden, don't fight with such a spouse.
It is not fair to fight, whose father delivered you himself,
father himself with mother, whom one must obey.
Your maidenhood is not all yours, part of it is your parents',
a third for your father, a third given to your mother,
only third is yours: don't fight with the two of them,
who by right gave it to their son-in-law along with your dowery.
Hymen o Hymenaeus, come Hymen o Hymenaeus!
