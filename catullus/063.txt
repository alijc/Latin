LXIII. de Berecinthia et Athi 

Super alta vectus Attis celeri rate maria,
Phrygium ut nemus citato cupide pede tetigit,
adiitque opaca silvis redimita loca deae,
stimulatus ibi furenti rabie, vagus animis,
devolsit ili acuto sibi pondera silice,
itaque ut relicta sensit sibi membra sine viro,
etiam recente terrae sola sanguine maculans,
niveis citata cepit manibus leve typanum,
typanum tuum, Cybele, tua, mater initia,
quatiensque terga tauri teneris cava digitis
canere haec suis adorta est tremebunda comitibus.
'agite ite ad alta, Gallae, Cybeles nemora simul,
simul ite, Dindymenae dominae vaga pecora,
aliena quae petentes velut exules loca
sectam meam exsecutae duce me mihi comites
rapidum salum tulistis truculentaque pelagi

LXIII. on Berecynthia and Attis

Upon the deep seas was Attis borne on an agile ship,
as he eagerly touched the Phrygian forest with a hurried foot,
he approached goddess's province, shaded and encircled by woods,
thereupon urged on by raging madness, wandering in his mind,
with a sharp stone he ripped off the weights at his groin,
and so as zhe perceived zher members discarded and sherself unmanned,
even with fresh blood staining the soil of the earth,
with snowy hands zhe seized a graceful drum,
your drum, Cybele, your beginnings, mother,
and shaking zher grundel you are held in the hollow of zher hand
this trembling person tried to sing to zher comrades.
"Come, go to the deep forest, you Galli, Cybele too,
go too, you roving cattle of the Dindymenian mistress,
who desire strange places, as if you were in exile
my comrades, who followed my path by my guide,
you bore the rushing ocean and savage sea


et corpus evirastis Veneris nimio odio;
hilarate erae citatis erroribus animum.
mora tarda mente cedat: simul ite, sequimini
Phrygiam ad domum Cybebes, Phrygia ad nemora deae,
ubi cymbalum sonat vox, ubi tympana reboant,
tibicen ubi canit Phryx curvo grave calamo,
ubi capita Maenades ui iaciunt hederigerae,
ubi sacra sancta acutis ululatibus agitant,
ubi suevit illa divae volitare vaga cohors,
quo nos decet citatis celerare tripudiis.'
simul haec comitibus Attis cecinit notha mulier,
thiasus repente linguis trepidantibus ululat,
leve tympanum remugit, cava cymbala recrepant.
viridem citus adit Idam properante pede chorus.
furibunda simul anhelans vaga vadit animam agens
comitata tympano Attis per opaca nemora dux,
veluti iuvenca vitans onus indomita iugi;

...and you have unmanned the flesh of Venus I hate too much;
cheer ye the soul of the lady by swift wanderings.
let a slow delay yield to the mind: at the same time go ye, follow
the Phrygian to the house of Cybebes, to the forests of the goddess,
where the voice expresses a cymbal, where the drums resound,
where the flutist plays on a heavy, crooked panpipe,
where the heads hurl the Bacchantes with violence ???????,
where sacred sacrifice with sharp wailings stirs,
where the goddess's roving court was wont to fly,
by which it behooves us to make haste with swift dances.'
At the same time this illegitimate woman, Attis, sang,
a Bacchic dance she? suddenly howls with trembling tongues,
the light drum resounds, replies with a hollow cymbal.
the swift chorus approaches the green (one/man) with a hurried foot.
At the same time the raging, roving, panting one advances, leading the soul
accompanied by a drum, Attis through dark forests the guide,
like an unbroken heifer, avoiding the burden of a yoke;
