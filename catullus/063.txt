LXIII. de Berecinthia et Athi 

Super alta vectus Attis celeri rate maria,
Phrygium ut nemus citato cupide pede tetigit,
adiitque opaca silvis redimita loca deae,
stimulatus ibi furenti rabie, vagus animis,
devolsit ili acuto sibi pondera silice,
itaque ut relicta sensit sibi membra sine viro,
etiam recente terrae sola sanguine maculans,
niveis citata cepit manibus leve typanum,
typanum tuum, Cybele, tua, mater initia,
quatiensque terga tauri teneris cava digitis
canere haec suis adorta est tremebunda comitibus.
'agite ite ad alta, Gallae, Cybeles nemora simul,
simul ite, Dindymenae dominae vaga pecora,
aliena quae petentes velut exules loca
sectam meam exsecutae duce me mihi comites
rapidum salum tulistis truculentaque pelagi
et corpus evirastis Veneris nimio odio;
hilarate erae citatis erroribus animum.
mora tarda mente cedat: simul ite, sequimini
Phrygiam ad domum Cybebes, Phrygia ad nemora deae,
ubi cymbalum sonat vox, ubi tympana reboant,
tibicen ubi canit Phryx curvo grave calamo,
ubi capita Maenades ui iaciunt hederigerae,
ubi sacra sancta acutis ululatibus agitant,
ubi suevit illa divae volitare vaga cohors,
quo nos decet citatis celerare tripudiis.'
simul haec comitibus Attis cecinit notha mulier,
thiasus repente linguis trepidantibus ululat,
leve tympanum remugit, cava cymbala recrepant.
viridem citus adit Idam properante pede chorus.
furibunda simul anhelans vaga vadit animam agens
comitata tympano Attis per opaca nemora dux,
veluti iuvenca vitans onus indomita iugi;
rapidae ducem sequuntur Gallae properipedem.
itaque, ut domum Cybebes tetigere lassulae,
nimio e labore somnum capiunt sine Cerere.
piger his labante languore oculos sopor operit;
abit in quiete molli rabidus furor animi.
sed ubi oris aurei Sol radiantibus oculis
lustravit aethera album, sola dura, mare ferum,
pepulitque noctis umbras vegetis sonipedibus,
ibi Somnus excitam Attin fugiens citus abiit;
trepidante eum recepit dea Pasithea sinu.
ita de quiete molli rapida sine rabie
simul ipsa pectore Attis sua facta recoluit,
liquidaque mente vidit sine quis ubique foret,
animo aestuante rusum reditum ad vada tetulit.
ibi maria vasta visens lacrimantibus oculis,
patriam allocuta maestast ita voce miseriter.
'patria o mei creatrix, patria o mea genetrix,
ego quam miser relinquens, dominos ut erifugae
famuli solent, ad Idae tetuli nemora pedem,
ut apud nivem et ferarum gelida stabula forem
et earum omnia adirem furibunda latibula,
ubinam aut quibus locis te positam, patria, reor?
cupit ipsa pupula ad te sibi derigere aciem,
rabie fera carens dum breve tempus animus est.
egone a mea remota haec ferar in nemora domo?
patria, bonis, amicis, genitoribus abero?
abero foro, palaestra, stadio, et gymnasiis?
miser ah miser, querendum est etiam atque etiam, anime.
quod enim genus figurae est ego non quod obierim?
ego mulier, ego adulescens, ego ephebus, ego puer,
ego gymnasi fui flos, ego eram decus olei:
mihi ianuae frequentes, mihi limina tepida,


LXIII. on Berecynthia and Attis

Upon the deep seas was Attis borne on an agile ship,
as he eagerly touched the Phrygian forest with a hurried foot,
he approached goddess's province, shaded and encircled by woods,
thereupon urged on by raging madness, wandering in his mind,
with a sharp stone he ripped off the weights at his groin,
and so as zhe perceived zher members discarded and sherself unmanned,
even with fresh blood staining the soil of the earth,
with snowy hands zhe seized a graceful drum,
your drum, Cybele, your beginnings, mother,
and shaking zher grundel you are held in the hollow of zher hand
this trembling person tried to sing to zher comrades.
"Come, go to the deep forest, you Galli, Cybele too,
go too, you roving cattle of the Dindymenian mistress,
who desire strange places, as if you were in exile
my comrades, who followed my path by my guide,
you bore the rushing ocean and savage sea
and you have gelded your flesh through excessive hate of Venus;
gladden our mistress's heart with your swift wanderings.
let the sluggish delay pass from your mind: go at once, follow
to Cybele's Phrygian house, to the goddess's Phrygian woods,
where the cymbal resounds and the voice, where the drums reechoes,
where the Phrygian flutist plays on a heavy bent pipe,
where the ivied Bacchantes toss their heads with vigor,
where they shake the sacred vessels with piercing wailings,
where the goddess's roving throng was wont to flit,
whither it behooves us to make haste with swift dances.'
As soon as Attis, this counterfeit woman, chanted this to zher comrades,
a Bacchic dance suddenly wails from trembling tongues,
the light drum responds, hollow cymbals reply.
the swirling dance approaches green Ida on hasty feet.
While the raging, roving, panting Attis rushes on, gasping for breath
and attended by zher drum, leading them through dark forests,
like an untrained heifer that shirks the weight of the yoke,
the fierce Galli follow their fleet-footed leader.
And so, as they, worn-out, reach Cybele's house,
from too much toil they seize at sleep, forgoing food.
Reluctant slumber covers their eyes with sinking faintness;
The raging madness of the mind departs in soft repose.
But where the Sun of the golden mouth with shining eyes
surveyed the pale sky, the hard ground, the savage sea,
and drove out the shadows of night with lively hoof-beats,
there swift Sleep, fleeing roused Attis, departs;
the goddess Pasithea took it back to her trembling lap.
Thus from the soft repose without fierce madness
meanwhile in zher heart Attis recalled zher deeds,
and with a clear mind saw the things zhe'd lost,
with a burning soul zhe sped back again to the shoals.
There, gazing at the vast seas with weeping eyes,
at zher homeland so piteously, in a melancholy voice:
'o homeland, my creator, o homeland, my mother,
how wretched am I, leaving you, as runaway slaves are wont
to leave their masters, I bore for the woods on Ida on foot
to live near the snow and the icy dens of beasts
and visit all of their furious hidey-holes.
Where or in which places do I suppose you were placed, my homeland?
My very eye longs to direct its gaze towards you,
while my soul is briefly free from its savage madness.
Will I be driven from my distant home into these woods?
Will I my homeland, goods, friends, parents forsake?
Will I forsake the forum, the wrestling ground, the stadium, the gym?
My wretched, wretched soul, you should have protested again and again.
For what sort of form is there that I wouldn't take on?
I've been woman, youth, boy, and lad,
the flower of the gym, the glory of the wrestling ground:
for me the many visitors, for me the warm thresholds,
