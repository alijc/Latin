LXIII. de Berecinthia et Athi 

Super alta vectus Attis celeri rate maria,
Phrygium ut nemus citato cupide pede tetigit,
adiitque opaca silvis redimita loca deae,
stimulatus ibi furenti rabie, vagus animis,
devolsit ili acuto sibi pondera silice,
itaque ut relicta sensit sibi membra sine viro,
etiam recente terrae sola sanguine maculans,
niveis citata cepit manibus leve typanum,
typanum tuum, Cybele, tua, mater initia,
quatiensque terga tauri teneris cava digitis
canere haec suis adorta est tremebunda comitibus.
'agite ite ad alta, Gallae, Cybeles nemora simul,
simul ite, Dindymenae dominae vaga pecora,
aliena quae petentes velut exules loca
sectam meam exsecutae duce me mihi comites
rapidum salum tulistis truculentaque pelagi

LXIII. on Berecynthia and Attis

Upon the deep seas was Attis borne on an agile ship,
as he eagerly touched the Phrygian forest with a hurried foot,
he approached goddess's province, shaded and encircled by woods,
thereupon urged on by raging madness, wandering in his mind,
with a sharp stone he ripped off the weights at his groin,
and so as zhe perceived zher members discarded and sherself unmanned,
even with fresh blood staining the soil of the earth,
with snowy hands zhe seized a graceful drum,
your drum, Cybele, your beginnings, mother,
and shaking zher grundel you are held in the hollow of zher hand
this trembling person tried to sing to zher comrades.
"Come, go to the deep forest, you Galli, Cybele too,
go too, you roving cattle of the Dindymenian mistress,
who desire strange places, as if you were in exile
my comrades, who followed my path by my guide,
you bore the rushing ocean and savage sea
