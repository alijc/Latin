LXIII. de Berecinthia et Athi 

Super alta vectus Attis celeri rate maria,
Phrygium ut nemus citato cupide pede tetigit,
adiitque opaca silvis redimita loca deae,
stimulatus ibi furenti rabie, vagus animis,
devolsit ili acuto sibi pondera silice,
itaque ut relicta sensit sibi membra sine viro,
etiam recente terrae sola sanguine maculans,
niveis citata cepit manibus leve typanum,
typanum tuum, Cybele, tua, mater initia,
quatiensque terga tauri teneris cava digitis
canere haec suis adorta est tremebunda comitibus.
'agite ite ad alta, Gallae, Cybeles nemora simul,
simul ite, Dindymenae dominae vaga pecora,
aliena quae petentes velut exules loca
sectam meam exsecutae duce me mihi comites
rapidum salum tulistis truculentaque pelagi

LXIII. on Berecynthia and Attis

Upon the deep seas Attis was borne on an agile ship,
as he eagerly touched the Phrygian forest with a hurried foot,
he approached goddess's regions, shaded and encircled by woods,
thereupon urged forward by raging madness, wandering in his mind,
he tore off the weights at his groin with a sharp stone,
and so as he sensed his abandoned members without manliness,
yet with fresh blood spotting the soil of the earth,
with snowy hands he lightly seized a drum,
your drum, Cybele, your entrances, mother,
and shaking his grundel??? you are held in the hollow of his hand
to sing these trembling things?? was attempted by his comrades.
"Come, go to the deep forest, Galli, Cybele too,
go too, you roving cattle of the Dindymenian mistress,
who desire strange places, as if you were in exile
lead my severed self to me, comrades,
bring the rushing ocean and savage sea
