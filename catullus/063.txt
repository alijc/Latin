LXIII. de Berecinthia et Athi 

Super alta vectus Attis celeri rate maria,
Phrygium ut nemus citato cupide pede tetigit,
adiitque opaca silvis redimita loca deae,
stimulatus ibi furenti rabie, vagus animis,
de volsit ili acuto sibi pondera silice,
itaque ut relicta sensit sibi membra sine viro,
etiam recente terrae sola sanguine maculans,
niveis citata cepit manibus leve typanum,
typanum tuum, Cybebe, tua, mater initia,
quatiensque terga tauri teneris cava digitis
canere haec suis adorta est tremebunda comitibus.
'agite ite ad alta, Gallae, Cybeles nemora simul,
simul ite, Dindymenae dominae vaga pecora,
aliena quae petentes velut exules loca
sectam meam exsecutae duce me mihi comites
rapidum salum tulistis truculentaque pelagi

LXIII. on Berecinthia and Athi ????

Upon the deep seas Attis was borne on a swift ship,
as he eagerly touched the Phrygian forest with a swift foot,
he approached goddess's regions, shaded and encircled by woods,
urged forward there by raging madness, wandering in his mind,
from he tore weights at his groin with a sharp stone,
and so as he felt his forsaken limbs without venom,
yet by fresh blood polluting/spotting the soil of the earth,
with snowy hands he lightly seized a drum,
your drum, Cybeles, your beginnings, mother,
and shaking the backs of a bull you are held in the hollow of his hand
to sing these was begun/influenced/attempted by his comrades.
Come on, go to the high/deep forest, Gauls, Cybeles likewise,
go too, roving cattle of the Dindymenia mistress,
who desire strange places, as if you were in exile
lead my severed female self? to me, comrades,
bring the swift salt/wit/sea and ferocious sea
