LXIV. Argonautia et epythalamium Thetidis et Pelei

Peliaco quondam prognatae vertice pinus
dicuntur liquidas Neptuni nasse per undas
Phasidos ad fluctus et fines Aeetaeos,
cum lecti iuvenes, Argiuae robora pubis,
auratam optantes Colchis avertere pellem
ausi sunt vada salsa cita decurrere puppi,
caerula verrentes abiegnis aequora palmis.
diva quibus retinens in summis urbibus arces
ipsa levi fecit volitantem flamine currum,
pinea coniungens inflexae texta carinae.
illa rudem cursu prima imbuit Amphitriten;
quae simul ac rostro ventosum proscidit aequor
tortaque remigio spumis incanuit unda,
emersere freti candenti e gurgite vultus
aequoreae monstrum Nereides admirantes.
illa, atque alia, viderunt luce marinas
mortales oculis nudato corpore Nymphas
nutricum tenus exstantes e gurgite cano.
tum Thetidis Peleus incensus fertur amore,
tum Thetis humanos non despexit hymenaeos,
tum Thetidi pater ipse iugandum Pelea sensit.

LXIV. ?? and ??  ?? and ??

By Peliacus once pines sprung from an eddy
they are called clear of Neptune to have floated through the waves
??? to the tides and ends ???,
when young beds, oaks of adulescent ???,
they, selecting, turned away from a gilded hide
they were intended to race swift salty fords with a ship,
deep blue surface of the sea sweeping along to/by palm wood.

divine to/by who/which/any holding back strongholds in the highest cities
herself to/by light breeze makes the flying chariot,
covered in pines uniting the fabric of the curved keel.

She wet(s) the ??? staff in her zeal;
who likewise cut the windy surface of the sea with the prow
and bent with rowing turned gray from the froth by the wave,
they rose up out of the water of the narrow sea gleaming white out of the
whirlpool of the face
the Nereides marveling at the monster of the sea.

She and they, mortal, see by daylight the sea-born
Nymphs with bodies laid bare by the eyes
of the nurses as far as being visible out of the whirlpool with a basket.

Then fiery Peleus is brought to love Thetis,
Then Thetis did not despise the human weddings,
then the father of Thetis himself felt to be wed.
