LXIV. Argonautia et epythalamium Thetidis et Pelei

Peliaco quondam prognatae vertice pinus
dicuntur liquidas Neptuni nasse per undas
Phasidos ad fluctus et fines Aeetaeos,
cum lecti iuvenes, Argiuae robora pubis,
auratam optantes Colchis avertere pellem
ausi sunt vada salsa cita decurrere puppi,
caerula verrentes abiegnis aequora palmis.
diva quibus retinens in summis urbibus arces
ipsa levi fecit volitantem flamine currum,
pinea coniungens inflexae texta carinae.
illa rudem cursu prima imbuit Amphitriten;
quae simul ac rostro ventosum proscidit aequor
tortaque remigio spumis incanuit unda,
emersere freti candenti e gurgite vultus
aequoreae monstrum Nereides admirantes.
illa, atque alia, viderunt luce marinas
mortales oculis nudato corpore Nymphas
nutricum tenus exstantes e gurgite cano.
tum Thetidis Peleus incensus fertur amore,
tum Thetis humanos non despexit hymenaeos,
tum Thetidi pater ipse iugandum Pelea sensit.
o nimis optato saeclorum tempore nati
heroes, salvete, deum genus! o bona matrum
progenies, salvete iter...
vos ego saepe, meo vos carmine compellabo.
teque adeo eximie taedis felicibus aucte,
Thessaliae columen Peleu, cui Iuppiter ipse,
ipse suos divum genitor concessit amores;
tene Thetis tenuit pulcerrima Nereine?
tene suam Tethys concessit ducere neptem,
Oceanusque, mari totum qui amplectitur orbem?
quae simul optatae finito tempore luces
advenere, domum conventu tota frequentat
Thessalia, oppletur laetanti regia coetu:
dona ferunt prae se, declarant gaudia vultu.
deseritur Cieros, linquunt Pthiotica Tempe
Crannonisque domos ac moenia Larisaea,
Pharsalum coeunt, Pharsalia tecta frequentant.
rura colit nemo, mollescunt colla iuvencis,
non humilis curvis purgatur vinea rastris,
non glebam prono convellit vomere taurus,
non falx attenuat frondatorum arboris umbram,
squalida desertis rubigo infertur aratris.
ipsius at sedes, quacumque opulenta recessit
regia, fulgenti splendent auro atque argento.
candet ebur soliis, collucent pocula mensae,
tota domus gaudet regali splendida gaza.
pulvinar vero divae geniale locatur
sedibus in mediis, Indo quod dente politum
tincta tegit roseo conchyli purpura fuco.
haec vestis priscis hominum variata figuris
heroum mira virtutes indicat arte.

namque fluentisono prospectans litore Diae,
Thesea cedentem celeri cum classe tuetur
indomitos in corde gerens Ariadna furores,
necdum etiam sese quae visit visere credit,
utpote fallaci quae tum primum excita somno
desertam in sola miseram se cernat harena.
immemor at iuvenis fugiens pellit vada remis,
irrita ventosae linquens promissa procellae.
quem procul ex alga maestis Minois ocellis,
saxea ut effigies bacchantis, prospicit, eheu,
prospicit et magnis curarum fluctuat undis,
non flavo retinens subtilem vertice mitram,
non contecta levi velatum pectus amictu,
non tereti strophio lactentis vincta papillas,
omnia quae toto delapsa e corpore passim
ipsius ante pedes fluctus salis alludebant.
sed neque tum mitrae neque tum fluitantis amictus
illa vicem curans toto ex te pectore, Theseu,
toto animo, tota pendebat perdita mente.
misera, assiduis quam luctibus externavit
spinosas Erycina serens in pectore curas,
illa tempestate, ferox quo ex tempore Theseus
egressus curvis e litoribus Piraei
attigit iniusti regis Gortynia templa.
nam perhibent olim crudeli peste coactam
Androgeoneae poenas exsolvere caedis
electos iuvenes simul et decus innuptarum
Cecropiam solitam esse dapem dare Minotauro.


LXIV. The Argonauts and the nuptials of Thetis and Peleus.

Once upon a time pines sprung from Pelion's peak
are said to have floated through Neptune's clear waves
to Phasidos' tides and  Aeetaeos' lands,
when the chosen youths, the young oaks of Argos,
seeking to snatch Colchis' gilded pelt,
dared to shoot briny channels with their swift ship,
sweeping the deep blue surface of the sea with fir oars.
The goddess who preserves the strongholds at the summits of cities
herself made the craft flying on a light breeze,
joining the curved keel with a web of pine.
It gave the first lesson to unschooled Amphitrite;
who, soon as it cut the windy surface of the sea with its prow
and bent with rowing whitened by the froth of the wave,
the faces of the Nereides rose up out of the gleaming white whirlpools
of the strait, marveling at the portent of the sea.
On that very day, mortal men saw by daylight, with their eyes,
the sea-born Nymphs with bodies laid bare 
to the breasts, showing above the white whirlpool.
Then fiery Peleus is brought to love Thetis,
then Thetis did not despise human marriage,
then the Thetis' father himself deemed her union with Peleus.
In the time of the ages too well desired,
hail, heroes, a race born of the gods! 
O, best progeny of mothers, hail...
I will often call upon you in my prayer.
And I approach thee, much increased, with fruitful torches,
Peleus, the pillar of Thessalia, to whom Jupiter himself,
the father of the gods himself, yielded his beloved;
Did not Thetis, most beautiful of the Nerines, hold you fast?
Did not Tethys allow you to escort her granddaughter,
and also Ocean, with the sea that encircles the whole world?
As soon as the chosen days arrived, 
all Thessalia throngs the house,
the palace is filled with rejoicing company:
they bear gifts before them, they show joy in their looks.
Cieros is deserted, they forsake Pthiotican Tempe
and the houses of Crannon and the walls of Larisa,
they assemble at Pharsalus, they throng the houses of Pharsalia.
No one tends the farms, the necks of the bullocks turn soft,
the low-lying vine is not cleared by the bent hoe,
the bull does not dislodge a clod with an inclined plow, 
the pruner's knife does not thin the shade of the trees,
and filthy rust is carried in by abandoned plows.
But this habitation, in the recesses of the opulent palace,
glistens with gleaming gold and silver.
Ivory brightens the chairs, the table's goblets glitter,
the whole house rejoices with splendid royal treasure.
The sacred nuptial couch in truth is placed
in the middle of the palace, polished like Indian ivory -
a purple cloth covers it with the rosy dye of the murex.
This garment, patterned with ancient figures of men,
with marvelous skill shows the heroes' courage.

For gazing out over the wave-beaten shore of Dia,
Ariadne, bearing untamable passions in her heart,
beholds Theseus departing with his swift fleet
and even yet she does not trust herself to look at what she sees,
as when she was first woken from a deceitful sleep
sees herself, alone, abandoned on the strand.
Forgetful youth, fleeing, strikes the sea with his oars,
forsaking his vain promises to the windy tempest.
Minos' daughter's gazes at him, from afar, with sorrowful eyes,
from the rocky seaweed, gazes like an effigy of a Bacchanite, alas!
and she heaves in great waves of troubles,
not restraining her delicate headdress with her red-gold whirlpool,
her veiled breast not covered by her thin mantle,
her milky teats not bound by a smooth breastband,
all of which, having slipped away from her body every which way
the waves of the sea played with before her feet.
But she, caring naught for either her headdress or her flowing mantle,
completely from her heart, Theseus,
she hung on you with all her soul, all her ruined mind.
Wretched woman, how she is beside herself with unending sorrows,
Venus sowing thorny cares in her breast
from that time that warlike Theseus
having set sail from the arching shores of Piraceus
arrived at the Gortynian temples of the unjust king.
For they long have said that by a cruel pestilence
Athens was forced to pay the penalty for the slaying of Androgeos,
selected youths together with the pick of the maidens
they were wont to give as a feast to the Minotaur.

quis angusta malis cum moenia vexarentur,
ipse suum Theseus pro caris corpus Athenis
proicere optavit potius quam talia Cretam
funera Cecropiae nec funera portarentur.
atque ita nave levi nitens ac lenibus auris
magnanimum ad Minoa venit sedesque superbas.
hunc simul ac cupido conspexit lumine virgo
regia, quam suavis exspirans castus odores
lectulus in molli complexu matris alebat,
quales Eurotae praecingunt flumina myrtus
aurave distinctos educit verna colores,
non prius ex illo flagrantia declinavit
lumina, quam cuncto concepit corpore flammam
funditus atque imis exarsit tota medullis.
heu misere exagitans immiti corde furores
sancte puer, curis hominum qui gaudia misces,
quaeque regis Golgos quaeque Idalium frondosum,
qualibus incensam iactastis mente puellam
fluctibus, in flavo saepe hospite suspirantem!
quantos illa tulit languenti corde timores!

to/by whose evils when the narrow town walls were shaken,
Theseus himself for his dear Athenians
chose to throw away his body so much more than Crete
funerals of Athens and not the funerals were borne.

And so with a swift ship forging on and with gentle breezes
he came to noble Minos and his haughty habitations.

The royal maiden saw him at once and in a loving light,
breathing out sweet chaste perfumes,
whom the couch nourished in the soft embrace of a mother
what kind of Eurotas encircle the rivers
or the myrtle with a spring breeze leads out the separate colors,
not before she turns the flaming lamps away from him,
than with all her body she conceived a flame
utterly and inwardly she blazed with her whole marrow.

Alas! have pity, stirring up passions with a cruel heart,
divine boy, you who blend joys with the cares of men,
whoever Golgos of the king  whoever leafy Idaium,
with what billows have you tossed from mind the fiery lass,
sighing often in a blonde hostess!

She brings so great a dread with her tired heart!
