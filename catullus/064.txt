LXIV. Argonautia et epythalamium Thetidis et Pelei

Peliaco quondam prognatae vertice pinus
dicuntur liquidas Neptuni nasse per undas
Phasidos ad fluctus et fines Aeetaeos,
cum lecti iuvenes, Argiuae robora pubis,
auratam optantes Colchis avertere pellem
ausi sunt vada salsa cita decurrere puppi,
caerula verrentes abiegnis aequora palmis.
diva quibus retinens in summis urbibus arces
ipsa levi fecit volitantem flamine currum,
pinea coniungens inflexae texta carinae.
illa rudem cursu prima imbuit Amphitriten;
quae simul ac rostro ventosum proscidit aequor
tortaque remigio spumis incanuit unda,
emersere freti candenti e gurgite vultus
aequoreae monstrum Nereides admirantes.
illa, atque alia, viderunt luce marinas
mortales oculis nudato corpore Nymphas
nutricum tenus exstantes e gurgite cano.
tum Thetidis Peleus incensus fertur amore,
tum Thetis humanos non despexit hymenaeos,
tum Thetidi pater ipse iugandum Pelea sensit.

LXIV. The Argonauts and the nuptials of Thetis and Peleus.

Once upon a time pines sprung from Pelion's peak
are said to have floated through Neptune's clear waves
to Phasidos' tides and  Aeetaeos' lands,
when the chosen youths, the young oaks of Argos,
seeking to snatch Colchis' gilded pelt,
dared to shoot briny channels with their swift ship,
sweeping the deep blue surface of the sea with fir oars.
The goddess who preserves the strongholds at the summits of cities
herself made the craft flying on a light breeze,
joining the curved keel with a web of pine.
It gave the first lesson to unschooled Amphitrite;
who, soon as it cut the windy surface of the sea with its prow
and bent with rowing whitened by the froth of the wave,
the faces of the Nereides rose up out of the gleaming white whirlpools
of the strait, marveling at the portent of the sea.
On that very day, mortal men saw by daylight, with their eyes,
the sea-born Nymphs with bodies laid bare 
to the breasts, showing above the white whirlpool.
Then fiery Peleus is brought to love Thetis,
then Thetis did not despise human marriage,
then the Thetis' father himself deemed her union with Peleus.


o nimis optato saeclorum tempore nati
heroes, salvete, deum genus! o bona matrum
progenies, salvete iter...
vos ego saepe, meo vos carmine compellabo.
teque adeo eximie taedis felicibus aucte,
Thessaliae columen Peleu, cui Iuppiter ipse,
ipse suos divum genitor concessit amores;
tene Thetis tenuit pulcerrima Nereine?
tene suam Tethys concessit ducere neptem,
Oceanusque, mari totum qui amplectitur orbem?
quae simul optatae finito tempore luces
advenere, domum conventu tota frequentat
Thessalia, oppletur laetanti regia coetu:
dona ferunt prae se, declarant gaudia vultu.
deseritur Cieros, linquunt Pthiotica Tempe
Crannonisque domos ac moenia Larisaea,
Pharsalum coeunt, Pharsalia tecta frequentant.
rura colit nemo, mollescunt colla iuvencis,
non humilis curvis purgatur vinea rastris,
non glebam prono convellit vomere taurus,
non falx attenuat frondatorum arboris umbram,
squalida desertis rubigo infertur aratris.

In the season of the ages too well desired
greetings, native heroes, a sort of gods! Oh, best
progeny of mothers, godspeed...
I will often call upon you in my prayer.
And I approach thee, exalted excellency, with fruitful pine torches,
Peleus, the pillar of Thessalia, to whom Jupiter himself,
himself the parent of the gods, granted his loves;
Hold, most beautiful Thetis held of Nereus?
Hold, Tethys allowed you to escort her granddaughter,
and Ocean, with the sea that encircles the whole world?
She who was likewise chosen in limited time the lights/eyes
they reached, all Thessalia throngs the house,
the palace is filled with rejoicing company:
they bear gifts before them, they reveal joy in their faces.
Cieros is deserted, they forsake Pthiotica Tempe????
and the houses of Crannonis and the walls of Larisa...,???
they assemble at Pharsalos, they haunt hidden Pharsalia.???
No one tends the farms, the necks of the bullocks turn soft,
the lowly vine is not cleared by the bent hoe,
the bull does not dislodge a clod with a leaning plowshare, 
the pruner's knife does not thin the shade of the trees,
the filthy rust is carried in by abandoned plows.
