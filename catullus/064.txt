LXIV. Argonautia et epythalamium Thetidis et Pelei

Peliaco quondam prognatae vertice pinus
dicuntur liquidas Neptuni nasse per undas
Phasidos ad fluctus et fines Aeetaeos,
cum lecti iuvenes, Argiuae robora pubis,
auratam optantes Colchis avertere pellem
ausi sunt vada salsa cita decurrere puppi,
caerula verrentes abiegnis aequora palmis.
diva quibus retinens in summis urbibus arces
ipsa levi fecit volitantem flamine currum,
pinea coniungens inflexae texta carinae.
illa rudem cursu prima imbuit Amphitriten;
quae simul ac rostro ventosum proscidit aequor
tortaque remigio spumis incanuit unda,
emersere freti candenti e gurgite vultus
aequoreae monstrum Nereides admirantes.
illa, atque alia, viderunt luce marinas
mortales oculis nudato corpore Nymphas
nutricum tenus exstantes e gurgite cano.
tum Thetidis Peleus incensus fertur amore,
tum Thetis humanos non despexit hymenaeos,
tum Thetidi pater ipse iugandum Pelea sensit.

LXIV. The Argonauts and the nuptials of Thetis and Peleus.

Once upon a time pines sprung from Pelion's peak
are said to have floated through Neptune's clear waves
to Phasidos' tides and  Aeetaeos' lands,
when the chosen youths, the young oaks of Argos,
seeking to snatch Colchis' gilded pelt,
dared to shoot briny channels with their swift ship,
sweeping the deep blue surface of the sea with fir oars.
The goddess who preserves the strongholds at the summits of cities
herself made the craft flying on a light breeze,
joining the curved keel with a web of pine.
It gave the first lesson to unschooled Amphitrite;
who, soon as it cut the windy surface of the sea with its prow
and bent with rowing whitened by the froth of the wave,
the faces of the Nereides rose up out of the gleaming white whirlpools
of the strait, marveling at the portent of the sea.
On that very day, mortal men saw by daylight, with their eyes,
the sea-born Nymphs with bodies laid bare 
to the breasts, showing above the white whirlpool.
Then fiery Peleus is brought to love Thetis,
then Thetis did not despise human marriage,
then the Thetis' father himself deemed her union with Peleus.
