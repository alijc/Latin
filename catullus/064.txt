LXIV. Argonautia et epythalamium Thetidis et Pelei

Peliaco quondam prognatae vertice pinus
dicuntur liquidas Neptuni nasse per undas
Phasidos ad fluctus et fines Aeetaeos,
cum lecti iuvenes, Argiuae robora pubis,
auratam optantes Colchis avertere pellem
ausi sunt vada salsa cita decurrere puppi,
caerula verrentes abiegnis aequora palmis.
diva quibus retinens in summis urbibus arces
ipsa levi fecit volitantem flamine currum,
pinea coniungens inflexae texta carinae.
illa rudem cursu prima imbuit Amphitriten;
quae simul ac rostro ventosum proscidit aequor
tortaque remigio spumis incanuit unda,
emersere freti candenti e gurgite vultus
aequoreae monstrum Nereides admirantes.
illa, atque alia, viderunt luce marinas
mortales oculis nudato corpore Nymphas
nutricum tenus exstantes e gurgite cano.
tum Thetidis Peleus incensus fertur amore,
tum Thetis humanos non despexit hymenaeos,
tum Thetidi pater ipse iugandum Pelea sensit.

o nimis optato saeclorum tempore nati
heroes, salvete, deum genus! o bona matrum
progenies, salvete iter...
vos ego saepe, meo vos carmine compellabo.
teque adeo eximie taedis felicibus aucte,
Thessaliae columen Peleu, cui Iuppiter ipse,
ipse suos divum genitor concessit amores;
tene Thetis tenuit pulcerrima Nereine?
tene suam Tethys concessit ducere neptem,
Oceanusque, mari totum qui amplectitur orbem?
quae simul optatae finito tempore luces
advenere, domum conventu tota frequentat
Thessalia, oppletur laetanti regia coetu:
dona ferunt prae se, declarant gaudia vultu.
deseritur Cieros, linquunt Pthiotica Tempe
Crannonisque domos ac moenia Larisaea,
Pharsalum coeunt, Pharsalia tecta frequentant.
rura colit nemo, mollescunt colla iuvencis,
non humilis curvis purgatur vinea rastris,
non glebam prono convellit vomere taurus,
non falx attenuat frondatorum arboris umbram,
squalida desertis rubigo infertur aratris.

LXIV. The Argonauts and the nuptials of Thetis and Peleus.

Once upon a time pines sprung from Pelion's peak
are said to have floated through Neptune's clear waves
to Phasidos' tides and  Aeetaeos' lands,
when the chosen youths, the young oaks of Argos,
seeking to snatch Colchis' gilded pelt,
dared to shoot briny channels with their swift ship,
sweeping the deep blue surface of the sea with fir oars.
The goddess who preserves the strongholds at the summits of cities
herself made the craft flying on a light breeze,
joining the curved keel with a web of pine.
It gave the first lesson to unschooled Amphitrite;
who, soon as it cut the windy surface of the sea with its prow
and bent with rowing whitened by the froth of the wave,
the faces of the Nereides rose up out of the gleaming white whirlpools
of the strait, marveling at the portent of the sea.
On that very day, mortal men saw by daylight, with their eyes,
the sea-born Nymphs with bodies laid bare 
to the breasts, showing above the white whirlpool.
Then fiery Peleus is brought to love Thetis,
then Thetis did not despise human marriage,
then the Thetis' father himself deemed her union with Peleus.
In the time of the ages too well desired,
hail, heroes, a race born of the gods! 
O, best progeny of mothers, hail...
I will often call upon you in my prayer.
And I approach thee, much increased, with fruitful torches,
Peleus, the pillar of Thessalia, to whom Jupiter himself,
the father of the gods himself, yielded his beloved;
Did not Thetis, most beautiful of the Nerines, hold you fast?
Did not Tethys allow you to escort her granddaughter,
and also Ocean, with the sea that encircles the whole world?
As soon as the chosen days arrived, 
all Thessalia throngs the house,
the palace is filled with rejoicing company:
they bear gifts before them, they show joy in their looks.
Cieros is deserted, they forsake Pthiotican Tempe
and the houses of Crannon and the walls of Larisa,
they assemble at Pharsalus, they throng the houses of Pharsalia.
No one tends the farms, the necks of the bullocks turn soft,
the low-lying vine is not cleared by the bent hoe,
the bull does not dislodge a clod with an inclined plow, 
the pruner's knife does not thin the shade of the trees,
and filthy rust is carried in by abandoned plows.

ipsius at sedes, quacumque opulenta recessit
regia, fulgenti splendent auro atque argento.
candet ebur soliis, collucent pocula mensae,
tota domus gaudet regali splendida gaza.
pulvinar vero divae geniale locatur
sedibus in mediis, Indo quod dente politum
tincta tegit roseo conchyli purpura fuco.
haec vestis priscis hominum variata figuris
heroum mira virtutes indicat arte.
namque fluentisono prospectans litore Diae,
Thesea cedentem celeri cum classe tuetur
indomitos in corde gerens Ariadna furores,
necdum etiam sese quae visit visere credit,
utpote fallaci quae tum primum excita somno
desertam in sola miseram se cernat harena.
immemor at iuvenis fugiens pellit vada remis,
irrita ventosae linquens promissa procellae.

But of he himself the seats/you sit, wherever the rich palace 
recedes, they glitter with gleaming gold and silver.
It sparkles ??? on the throne, the cups glitter on the table,
the whole house rejoices with splendid royal treasure.
The divine nuptial gods' couch in truth is placed
to/by seats in the middle, smooth as Indian ivory
it covers with damp purple of shellfish with rose-colored paint.
This garment to/by ancients of men variagated to/by figures 
of heroes virtue skillfully shows wonderful things.
Andfor to/by wave-pounding shore the Goddess gazing out,
Thesea sees the yielding man by/to swift with his band
Ariadne bearing fierce frenzies in her heart,
and not yet even she trusts herself to visit who visits,
inasmuch as to/by deceitful one who then first was woken from sleep
sees herself as a miserable grain of sand abandoned on the ground.
Forgetful youth, fleeing, strikes the channels with oars,
forsaking vain promises of the fickle storm.
