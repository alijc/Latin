LXIV. Argonautia et epythalamium Thetidis et Pelei

Peliaco quondam prognatae vertice pinus
dicuntur liquidas Neptuni nasse per undas
Phasidos ad fluctus et fines Aeetaeos,
cum lecti iuvenes, Argiuae robora pubis,
auratam optantes Colchis avertere pellem
ausi sunt vada salsa cita decurrere puppi,
caerula verrentes abiegnis aequora palmis.
diva quibus retinens in summis urbibus arces
ipsa levi fecit volitantem flamine currum,
pinea coniungens inflexae texta carinae.
illa rudem cursu prima imbuit Amphitriten;
quae simul ac rostro ventosum proscidit aequor
tortaque remigio spumis incanuit unda,
emersere freti candenti e gurgite vultus
aequoreae monstrum Nereides admirantes.
illa, atque alia, viderunt luce marinas
mortales oculis nudato corpore Nymphas
nutricum tenus exstantes e gurgite cano.
tum Thetidis Peleus incensus fertur amore,
tum Thetis humanos non despexit hymenaeos,
tum Thetidi pater ipse iugandum Pelea sensit.
o nimis optato saeclorum tempore nati
heroes, salvete, deum genus! o bona matrum
progenies, salvete iter...
vos ego saepe, meo vos carmine compellabo.
teque adeo eximie taedis felicibus aucte,
Thessaliae columen Peleu, cui Iuppiter ipse,
ipse suos divum genitor concessit amores;
tene Thetis tenuit pulcerrima Nereine?
tene suam Tethys concessit ducere neptem,
Oceanusque, mari totum qui amplectitur orbem?
quae simul optatae finito tempore luces
advenere, domum conventu tota frequentat
Thessalia, oppletur laetanti regia coetu:
dona ferunt prae se, declarant gaudia vultu.
deseritur Cieros, linquunt Pthiotica Tempe
Crannonisque domos ac moenia Larisaea,
Pharsalum coeunt, Pharsalia tecta frequentant.
rura colit nemo, mollescunt colla iuvencis,
non humilis curvis purgatur vinea rastris,
non glebam prono convellit vomere taurus,
non falx attenuat frondatorum arboris umbram,
squalida desertis rubigo infertur aratris.
ipsius at sedes, quacumque opulenta recessit
regia, fulgenti splendent auro atque argento.
candet ebur soliis, collucent pocula mensae,
tota domus gaudet regali splendida gaza.
pulvinar vero divae geniale locatur
sedibus in mediis, Indo quod dente politum
tincta tegit roseo conchyli purpura fuco.
haec vestis priscis hominum variata figuris
heroum mira virtutes indicat arte.

namque fluentisono prospectans litore Diae,
Thesea cedentem celeri cum classe tuetur
indomitos in corde gerens Ariadna furores,
necdum etiam sese quae visit visere credit,
utpote fallaci quae tum primum excita somno
desertam in sola miseram se cernat harena.
immemor at iuvenis fugiens pellit vada remis,
irrita ventosae linquens promissa procellae.
quem procul ex alga maestis Minois ocellis,
saxea ut effigies bacchantis, prospicit, eheu,
prospicit et magnis curarum fluctuat undis,
non flavo retinens subtilem vertice mitram,
non contecta levi velatum pectus amictu,
non tereti strophio lactentis vincta papillas,
omnia quae toto delapsa e corpore passim
ipsius ante pedes fluctus salis alludebant.
sed neque tum mitrae neque tum fluitantis amictus
illa vicem curans toto ex te pectore, Theseu,
toto animo, tota pendebat perdita mente.
misera, assiduis quam luctibus externavit
spinosas Erycina serens in pectore curas,
illa tempestate, ferox quo ex tempore Theseus
egressus curvis e litoribus Piraei
attigit iniusti regis Gortynia templa.
nam perhibent olim crudeli peste coactam
Androgeoneae poenas exsolvere caedis
electos iuvenes simul et decus innuptarum
Cecropiam solitam esse dapem dare Minotauro.
quis angusta malis cum moenia vexarentur,
ipse suum Theseus pro caris corpus Athenis
proicere optavit potius quam talia Cretam
funera Cecropiae nec funera portarentur.
atque ita nave levi nitens ac lenibus auris
magnanimum ad Minoa venit sedesque superbas.
hunc simul ac cupido conspexit lumine virgo
regia, quam suavis exspirans castus odores
lectulus in molli complexu matris alebat,
quales Eurotae praecingunt flumina myrtus
aurave distinctos educit verna colores,
non prius ex illo flagrantia declinavit
lumina, quam cuncto concepit corpore flammam
funditus atque imis exarsit tota medullis.
heu misere exagitans immiti corde furores
sancte puer, curis hominum qui gaudia misces,
quaeque regis Golgos quaeque Idalium frondosum,
qualibus incensam iactastis mente puellam
fluctibus, in flavo saepe hospite suspirantem!
quantos illa tulit languenti corde timores!
quanto saepe magis fulgore expalluit auri,
cum saevum cupiens contra contendere monstrum
aut mortem appeteret Theseus aut praemia laudis!

non ingrata tamen frustra munuscula divis
promittens tacito succepit vota labello.
nam velut in summo quatientem brachia Tauro
quercum aut conigeram sudanti cortice pinum
indomitus turbo contorquens flamine robur,
eruit (illa procul radicitus exturbata
prona cadit, late quaevis cumque obuia frangens,)
sic domito saevum prostravit corpore Theseus
nequiquam vanis iactantem cornua ventis.
inde pedem sospes multa cum laude reflexit
errabunda regens tenui vestigia filo,
ne labyrintheis e flexibus egredientem
tecti frustraretur inobservabilis error.

sed quid ego a primo digressus carmine plura
commemorem, ut linquens genitoris filia vultum,
ut consanguineae complexum, ut denique matris,
quae misera in gnata deperdita laeta
omnibus his Thesei dulcem praeoptarit amorem:
aut ut vecta rati spumosa ad litora Diae
aut ut eam devinctam lumina somno
liquerit immemori discedens pectore coniunx?
saepe illam perhibent ardenti corde furentem
clarisonas imo fudisse e pectore voces,
ac tum praeruptos tristem conscendere montes,
unde aciem in pelagi vastos protenderet aestus,
tum tremuli salis adversas procurrere in undas
mollia nudatae tollentem tegmina surae,
atque haec extremis maestam dixisse querellis,
frigidulos udo singultus ore cientem:

'sicine me patriis avectam, perfide, ab aris
perfide, deserto liquisti in litore, Theseu?
sicine discedens neglecto numine divum,
immemor a! devota domum periuria portas?
nullane res potuit crudelis flectere mentis
consilium? tibi nulla fuit clementia praesto,
immite ut nostri vellet miserescere pectus?

at non haec quondam blanda promissa dedisti
voce mihi, non haec miserae sperare iubebas,
sed conubia laeta, sed optatos hymenaeos,
quae cuncta aereii discerpunt irrita venti.
nunc iam nulla viro iuranti femina credat,
nulla viri speret sermones esse fideles;
quis dum aliquid cupiens animus praegestit apisci,
nil metuunt iurare, nihil promittere parcunt:
sed simul ac cupidae mentis satiata libido est,
dicta nihil metuere, nihil periuria curant.
certe ego te in medio versantem turbine leti
eripui, et potius germanum amittere crevi,
quam tibi fallaci supremo in tempore dessem.
pro quo dilaceranda feris dabor alitibusque
praeda, neque iniacta tumulabor mortua terra.
quaenam te genuit sola sub rupe leaena,
quod mare conceptum spumantibus exspuit undis,
quae Syrtis, quae Scylla rapax, quae vasta Carybdis,
talia qui reddis pro dulci praemia vita? 

si tibi non cordi fuerant conubia nostra,
saeva quod horrebas prisci praecepta parentis,
attamen in vestras potuisti ducere sedes,
quae tibi iucundo famularer serva labore,
candida permulcens liquidis vestigia lymphis,
purpureave tuum consternens veste cubile.

sed quid ego ignaris nequiquam conquerar auris,
externata malo, quae nullis sensibus auctae
nec missas audire queunt nec reddere voces?
ille autem prope iam mediis versatur in undis,
nec quisquam apparet vacua mortalis in alga.
sic nimis insultans extremo tempore saeva
fors etiam nostris invidit questibus auris.
Iuppiter omnipotens, utinam ne tempore primo
Gnosia Cecropiae tetigissent litora puppes,
indomito nec dira ferens stipendia tauro
perfidus in Cretam religasset navita funem,
nec malus hic celans dulci crudelia forma
consilia in nostris requiesset sedibus hospes!



LXIV. The Argonauts and the nuptials of Thetis and Peleus.

Once upon a time pines sprung from Pelion's peak
are said to have floated through Neptune's clear waves
to Phasidos' tides and  Aeetaeos' lands,
when the chosen youths, the young oaks of Argos,
seeking to snatch Colchis' gilded pelt,
dared to shoot briny channels with their swift ship,
sweeping the deep blue surface of the sea with fir oars.
The goddess who preserves the strongholds at the summits of cities
herself made the craft flying on a light breeze,
joining the curved keel with a web of pine.
It gave the first lesson to unschooled Amphitrite;
who, soon as it cut the windy surface of the sea with its prow
and bent with rowing whitened by the froth of the wave,
the faces of the Nereides rose up out of the gleaming white whirlpools
of the strait, marveling at the portent of the sea.
On that very day, mortal men saw by daylight, with their eyes,
the sea-born Nymphs with bodies laid bare 
to the breasts, showing above the white whirlpool.
Then fiery Peleus is brought to love Thetis,
then Thetis did not despise human marriage,
then the Thetis' father himself deemed her union with Peleus.
In the time of the ages too well desired,
hail, heroes, a race born of the gods! 
O, best progeny of mothers, hail...
I will often call upon you in my prayer.
And I approach thee, much increased, with fruitful torches,
Peleus, the pillar of Thessalia, to whom Jupiter himself,
the father of the gods himself, yielded his beloved;
Did not Thetis, most beautiful of the Nerines, hold you fast?
Did not Tethys allow you to escort her granddaughter,
and also Ocean, with the sea that encircles the whole world?
As soon as the chosen days arrived, 
all Thessalia throngs the house,
the palace is filled with rejoicing company:
they bear gifts before them, they show joy in their looks.
Cieros is deserted, they forsake Pthiotican Tempe
and the houses of Crannon and the walls of Larisa,
they assemble at Pharsalus, they throng the houses of Pharsalia.
No one tends the farms, the necks of the bullocks turn soft,
the low-lying vine is not cleared by the bent hoe,
the bull does not dislodge a clod with an inclined plow, 
the pruner's knife does not thin the shade of the trees,
and filthy rust is carried in by abandoned plows.
But this habitation, in the recesses of the opulent palace,
glistens with gleaming gold and silver.
Ivory brightens the chairs, the table's goblets glitter,
the whole house rejoices with splendid royal treasure.
The sacred nuptial couch in truth is placed
in the middle of the palace, polished like Indian ivory -
a purple cloth covers it with the rosy dye of the murex.
This garment, patterned with ancient figures of men,
with marvelous skill shows the heroes' courage.

For gazing out over the wave-beaten shore of Dia,
Ariadne, bearing untamable passions in her heart,
beholds Theseus departing with his swift fleet
and even yet she does not trust herself to look at what she sees,
as when she was first woken from a deceitful sleep
sees herself, alone, abandoned on the strand.
Forgetful youth, fleeing, strikes the sea with his oars,
forsaking his vain promises to the windy tempest.
Minos' daughter's gazes at him, from afar, with sorrowful eyes,
from the rocky seaweed, gazes like an effigy of a Bacchanite, alas!
and she heaves in great waves of troubles,
not restraining her delicate headdress with her red-gold whirlpool,
her veiled breast not covered by her thin mantle,
her milky teats not bound by a smooth breastband,
all of which, having slipped away from her body every which way
the waves of the sea played with before her feet.
But she, caring naught for either her headdress or her flowing mantle,
completely from her heart, Theseus,
she hung on you with all her soul, all her ruined mind.
Wretched woman, how she is beside herself with unending sorrows,
Venus sowing thorny cares in her breast
from that time that warlike Theseus
having set sail from the arching shores of Piraceus
arrived at the Gortynian temples of the unjust king.
For they long have said that by a cruel pestilence
Athens was forced to pay the penalty for the slaying of Androgeos,
selected youths together with the pick of the maidens
they were wont to give as a feast to the Minotaur.
When his narrow city walls were plagued by these evils,
Theseus, of his own accord, for his dear Athens
chose to throw away his body so that the unburied corpses 
of Athenians would no longer be borne to Crete.
And so with a swift ship forging on and with gentle breezes
he came to noble Minos and his haughty habitations.
The royal maiden saw him at once and in a loving light,
whom her chaste couch nourished in a mother's soft embrace,
breathing out sweet perfumes,
just as the rivers of Eurotas engender the myrtles
or the spring breeze draws out the separate colors,
before she could turn her burning eyes from him,
with all her body she conceived a flame
utterly and inwardly she blazed in her whole marrow.
Alas! divine boy, stirring up passions with a cruel heart,
have mercy, you who blend joys with the cares of men,
and you queen of Golgos and of leafy Idalium,
to what billows have you tossed the lass, with mind afire,
sighing often on her fair-haired guest!
She bore such dreads in her weary heart!
How often did she grow more pale than the gleam of gold,
since Theseus, wishing to strive against a ferocious monster,
would seek either death or the rewards of renown!

Yet promising not unacceptable small gifts to the gods,
and not in vain, with a silent little lip she made her vows.
For, just as the untamed whirlwind, twisting the tree in a gale,
uproots an oak shaking its branches on the summit of Mt Taurus,
or a cone-bearing pine with its sweating bark.
(Driven far from its roots, it falls flat, 
shattering, far and wide, whatever is in the way.)
In this way Theseus overthrew the savage in its mastered flesh
that jerked its horns in vain to the empty winds.
From there the unharmed man bent back his foot with much praise,
guiding his wandering steps with the slender thread,
to keep the maze from frustrating his exit from 
the labyrinthine and hard to track windings of the shelter.

But why should I myself, having first digressed from my poem, 
remember more, such as a daughter leaving the face of her father,
the embrace of a sister, or indeed of a mother,
wretched for a joyful lost daughter
who prefers the sweet love of Theseus to all these things:
Or how she came, borne by ship, to the foaming shore of Dia,
or how her spouse, departing with his heedless heart,
left her with her eyes bound fast by sleep?

They often say that she, maddened by her burning soul,
had poured shrill voices out of her inmost breast,
and that the sad woman now climbed up steep mountains,
whence she could stretch her gaze to the vast seething of the sea,
then rushed into the advancing waves of trembling salt,
lifting the delicate coverings from her calves,
and that the sorrowing lady said this, in her dying complaints,
driving the cold sobs with her tearful mouth:

'Did you thus abandon me, faithless man, on the deserted shore
faithless man, carried off from my father's house, Theseus?
Do you, departing thus in disregard of the divine will of the gods,
Ah heedless man! carry falsely sworn oaths home?
Could nothing appease the intention of a cruel mind?
Was there no mercy for you at hand
that your harsh heart might wish to have compassion for ours?
But these were not the fawning promises you voiced
to me of old. You led my poor self to hope not for this,
but for wedded bliss and a wished for match,
all empty air that the winds tear to bits.
Let no woman now trust a man's oaths,
let her not hope that a man's words are true;
as long as that lusting soul yearns to get laid,
never do they fear to swear falsely, or spare their promises.
But as soon as the desire of a lecherous mind was satisfied,
no more did they fear speech, or care about false oaths.
Surely I rescued you, spinning in the middle of a death's whirl,
and I had determined rather to to lose my own kin
than to neglect your deceitful self in the ultimate hour.
For which I'll be given as prey to be torn to pieces by wild beasts
and birds, and not, when dead, be entombed with earth laid on.
What lioness gave birth to you, alone beneath a rock,
what sea did spit you out, conceived in frothing waves,
which Sytis, which grasping Scylla, which monstrous Carybdis,
you who give such rewards in return for your sweet life?
Had our marriage not been to your liking
because you bristled at the cruel rules of your stern father,
you could still conduct into your family's home
one who, as a servant, would attend you in a pleasing toil,
caressing your pale feet with clear water,
covering your couch with a purple blanket.

But why do I, frightened by evil, lament in vain to
the unmindful breezes, which, endowed with no senses,
can neither hear sounds sent out nor send them back?
But he already wheels about in the midst of the waves,
and no mortal man is seen in the empty wrack.
Thus, even cruel fortune mocking so in my extremity
begrudged her ears to our complaints.
Almighty Jupiter, had but the the ships
of Cecropia never touched the Gnosian shore,
bearing awful tributes to the ungovernable bull,
or had the faithless sailor never moored in Crete,
or had the evil guest, hiding hard-hearted plans in a charming countenance,
never reposed here within our home!

nam quo me referam? quali spe perdita nitor?
Idaeosne petam montes? at gurgite lato
discernens ponti truculentum dividit aequor.
an patris auxilium sperem? quemne ipsa reliqui
respersum iuvenem fraterna caede secuta?
coniugis an fido consoler memet amore?
quine fugit lentos incuruans gurgite remos?
praeterea nullo colitur sola insula tecto,
nec patet egressus pelagi cingentibus undis.
nulla fugae ratio, nulla spes: omnia muta,
omnia sunt deserta, ostentant omnia letum.
non tamen ante mihi languescent lumina morte,
nec prius a fesso secedent corpore sensus,
quam iustam a divis exposcam prodita multam
caelestumque fidem postrema comprecer hora.
quare facta virum multantes vindice poena
Eumenides, quibus anguino redimita capillo
frons exspirantis praeportat pectoris iras,
huc huc adventate, meas audite querellas,
quas ego, vae misera, extremis proferre medullis
cogor inops, ardens, amenti caeca furore.

For where shall I go back to?  On what sort of hope do I, ruined, depend on?
Shall I beg the mountains of Ida?  But by the broad sea
discerning the ferocious surface of the sea it divides.
Can it be that I hope for the father's help?  whom herself of the remnant
splattered youth by a brother's murder pursued?
by/to/of a spouse can it be that I trust/by loyal I myself might by consoled by
love?
does he flee to the whirlpool, bending the clinging oars?
besides by no house is the island habited,
neither does the mouth of the sea lie open to the encircling waves.
No reason for flight, no hope, everything silent,
Everything is desolate, everything shows ruin.
Not yet before me the lights grow faint with death,
not before will the senses withdraw from the wearied body,
which, a lawful penalty, I, sprung up, will demand from the gods 
and I implore the faith of the heavens in the coming hour.
How the punishing penalty of men, done by the defender 
Furies, by/to whom by/to a snaky hair encircled
foliage of exhaling he carries before the rages of hir heart,
here, here approach, hear my grievances,
which I, alas, poor wretch profer from my inmost marrow
I am gathered, weak, burning, blinded by frantic rage.
