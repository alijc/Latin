LXV. ad Ortalum 

Etsi me assiduo confectum cura dolore
     sevocat a doctis, Ortale, virginibus,
nec potis est dulcis Musarum expromere fetus
     mens animi, tantis fluctuat ipsa malis—
namque mei nuper Lethaeo in gurgite fratris
     pallidulum manans alluit unda pedem,
Troia Rhoeteo quem subter litore tellus
     ereptum nostris obterit ex oculis.
* * * * * * * * 
     numquam ego te, vita frater amabilior,
aspiciam posthac? at certe semper amabo,
     semper maesta tua carmina morte canam,
qualia sub densis ramorum concinit umbris
     Daulias, absumpti fata gemens Ityli—


Even if by constant sorrow me care calls me, consumed, aside
 by the experienced maidens, Ortalus, 
and it is not sweet to drunks of the muses to put out the fertile
 mind of the soul, with/by such evils she herself surges -
for of me recently in forgetful flood of a brother
 he washed, wetting a pallid foot with a wave,
T R that underneath the shore the earth 
 crushes the snatched away with our eyes.
*****
  I never you, live, brother, more amiable,
will I gaze on after this?  But surely I will always love,
  always your gloomy poems by death I will sing,
what sort of under the thick shadows of branches he chants
  Daulias, moaning dooms of Itylus.
