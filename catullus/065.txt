LXV. ad Ortalum 

Etsi me assiduo confectum cura dolore
     sevocat a doctis, Ortale, virginibus,
nec potis est dulcis Musarum expromere fetus
     mens animi, tantis fluctuat ipsa malis—
namque mei nuper Lethaeo in gurgite fratris
     pallidulum manans alluit unda pedem,
Troia Rhoeteo quem subter litore tellus
     ereptum nostris obterit ex oculis.
* * * * * * * * 
     numquam ego te, vita frater amabilior,
aspiciam posthac? at certe semper amabo,
     semper maesta tua carmina morte canam,
qualia sub densis ramorum concinit umbris
     Daulias, absumpti fata gemens Ityli—


Although care calls me, exhausted with constant sorrow, 
 away from the learned maidens, Ortalus, 
and my soul's mind can not show the sweet outpourings of the Muses
 - it roils with such evils -
for recently the flowing wave has washed my brother's pale foot
  in the River of Forgetfulness,
he whom, snatched away from our sight, the Trojan earth 
  crushes underneath the shore of Rhoeteum.
*****
  I'll never gaze on you again, brother,
more loving than life.  But surely I will always love you,
  always I'll sing songs made mournful by your death,
like those that the exhausted nightingale sings under branches' thick shadows,
 sighing the dooms of Itylus -



sed tamen in tantis maeroribus, Ortale, mitto
     haec expressa tibi carmina Battiadae,
ne tua dicta vagis nequiquam credita ventis
     effluxisse meo forte putes animo,
ut missum sponsi furtivo munere malum
     procurrit casto virginis e gremio,
quod miserae oblitae molli sub veste locatum,
     dum adventu matris prosilit, excutitur,
atque illud prono praeceps agitur decursu,
     huic manat tristi conscius ore rubor.


Yet in such griefs, Ortalus, I send
    these translated poems of Battiades to you,
lest you think that your remarks, entrusted in vain to a wandering wind,
     have perchance have slipped from my mind,
as an apple, sent on a secret mission by her lover,
    falls out of a maiden's chaste lap.
It was placed under the forgetful wretch's soft garment,
    and as she springs up at her mother's approach, it's shaken off,
and it's suddenly thrown to earth,
    at this her knowing blush spreads from her sad mouth.
