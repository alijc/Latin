LXV. ad Ortalum 

Etsi me assiduo confectum cura dolore
     sevocat a doctis, Ortale, virginibus,
nec potis est dulcis Musarum expromere fetus
     mens animi, tantis fluctuat ipsa malis—
namque mei nuper Lethaeo in gurgite fratris
     pallidulum manans alluit unda pedem,
Troia Rhoeteo quem subter litore tellus
     ereptum nostris obterit ex oculis.
* * * * * * * * 
     numquam ego te, vita frater amabilior,
aspiciam posthac? at certe semper amabo,
     semper maesta tua carmina morte canam,
qualia sub densis ramorum concinit umbris
     Daulias, absumpti fata gemens Ityli—


Although care calls me, exhausted with constant sorrow, 
 away from the learned maidens, Ortalus, 
and my soul's mind can not show the sweet outpourings of the Muses
 - it roils with such evils -
for recently the flowing wave has washed my brother's pale foot
  in the River of Forgetfulness,
he whom, snatched away from our sight, the Trojan earth 
  crushes underneath the shore of Rhoeteum.
*****
  I'll never gaze on you again, brother,
more loving than life.  But surely I will always love you,
  always I'll sing songs made mournful by your death,
like those that Daulias, spent, sings under the thick shadows of branches,
 sighing the dooms of Itylus -



sed tamen in tantis maeroribus, Ortale, mitto
     haec expressa tibi carmina Battiadae,
ne tua dicta vagis nequiquam credita ventis
     effluxisse meo forte putes animo,
ut missum sponsi furtivo munere malum
     procurrit casto virginis e gremio,
quod miserae oblitae molli sub veste locatum,
     dum adventu matris prosilit, excutitur,
atque illud prono praeceps agitur decursu,
     huic manat tristi conscius ore rubor.


but yet in such sadnesses, Ortalus, I send
    these lesser poems of Battiada to you,
lest you think that your witticisms, lent by a wandering wind,
     have vainly been forgotten by my strong mind,
as the dispatched evil of the groom with secret service
    runs ahead out of the chaste lap of the virgin,
that/because under the soft garment of the forgetful wretch it was placed,
    while by coming of the mother leaps forth, is shaken off,
and that by leaning forward/prone headlong/headfirst it is urged in running,
    to this sad mouth the partner flows redness.
