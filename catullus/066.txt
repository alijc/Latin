LXVI.

Omnia qui magni dispexit lumina mundi,
     qui stellarum ortus comperit atque obitus,
flammeus ut rapidi solis nitor obscuretur,
     ut cedant certis sidera temporibus,
ut Triviam furtim sub Latmia saxa relegans
     dulcis amor gyro devocet aereo:
idem me ille Conon caelesti in limine vidit
     e Beroniceo vertice caesariem
fulgentem clare, quam multis illa dearum
     levia protendens brachia pollicita est,
qua rex tempestate novo auctus hymenaeo
     vastatum finis iuerat Assyrios,
dulcia nocturnae portans vestigia rixae,
     quam de virgineis gesserat exuviis.
estne novis nuptis odio Venus? anne parentum
     frustrantur falsis gaudia lacrimulis,
ubertim thalami quas intra limina fundunt?
     non, ita me divi, vera gemunt, iuerint.
id mea me multis docuit regina querellis
     invisente novo proelia torva viro.
et tu non orbum luxti deserta cubile,
     sed fratris cari flebile discidium?
quam penitus maestas exedit cura medullas!
     ut tibi tunc toto pectore sollicitae
sensibus ereptis mens excidit! at ego certe
     cognoram a parva virgine magnanimam.
anne bonum oblita es facinus, quo regium adepta es
     coniugium, quod non fortior ausit alis?
sed tum maesta virum mittens quae verba locuta est!
     Iuppiter, ut tristi lumina saepe manu!
quis te mutavit tantus deus? an quod amantes
     non longe a caro corpore abesse volunt?
atque ibi me cunctis pro dulci coniuge divis
     non sine taurino sanguine pollicita es,
si reditum tetulisset. is haut in tempore longo
     captam Asiam Aegypti finibus addiderat.
quis ego pro factis caelesti reddita coetu
     pristina vota novo munere dissolvo.
invita, o regina, tuo de vertice cessi,
     invita: adiuro teque tuumque caput,
digna ferat quod si quis inaniter adiurarit:
     sed qui se ferro postulet esse parem?
ille quoque eversus mons est, quem maximum in oris
     progenies Thiae clara supervehitur,
cum Medi peperere novum mare, cumque iuventus
     per medium classi barbara navit Athon.

He who discerned all the lights of the spacious heavens,
  who ascertained the risings and the settings of the stars,
how the fiery splendor of the scorching sun is obscured,
  how the constellations go away in certain seasons,
how sweet love summons Trivia/Diana from her celestrial orbit,
  stealthily slipping her out of sight beneath the rock of Latmus:
that same renowned Conon saw in the heavenly house
  me, the flowing hair from Berenice's head,
brightly gleaming, hair that she promised to many goddesses,
  stretching out her delicate arms,
in the time that the king, enlarged by a new marriage,
  had gone to lay waste to land of the Assyrians,
carrying the sweet traces of the nocturnal battle
  in which he had borne off her maidenly spoils.
Is Venus hateful to new brides?  Are parents'
  joys are frustrated by the false tears
that pour out copiously within the chamber's threshold?
  By my gods, they do not truly lament, they will pass.
My queen taught this to me with her many complaints
  when her new husband went off to fierce battles.
And didn't you, deserted, mourn, not the empty bed,
  but the doleful separation of a dear brother?
How deeply care did eat away your sorrowful soul!
  As it then fell to you, upset with shredded feelings,
with your whole heart!  But surely I knew you,
  magnanimous, since you were a small child.
Have you forgotten the noble deed with which you gained a regal
  spouse, that no one else more boldly dared?
But then, sending your husband off, you spoke those melancholy words!
  Jupiter! How often you wiped your eyes with your hand!
Which great god changed you?  Can it be that lovers
  are no longer willing to be far from a dear body?
And there you promised me to all the gods for the sake of your sweet spouse,
  not without a bull's blood,
if he would return safely.  He had, in short order,
  added captive Asia to Egypt's bounds.
On account of this in a celestial union I,
  your former vow, was returned and to a new service released.
Reluctantly, o queen, did I leave your crown,
  reluctantly: I swear to you and to your head,
that if anyone swears in vain, may he get what he deserves:
  but who would claim himself equal to a sword?
Even that mountain range, the greatest in the world, that
  the shining progeny of Thia passes by, was uprooted
when the Medeans created a new sea, when their youth 
  sailed a foreign fleet through the Athos Mountains.

quid facient crines, cum ferro talia cedant?
     Iuppiter, ut Chalybon omne genus pereat,
et qui principio sub terra quaerere venas
     institit ac ferri stringere duritiem!
abiunctae paulo ante comae mea fata sorores
     lugebant, cum se Memnonis Aethiopis
unigena impellens nutantibus aera pennis
     obtulit Arsinoes Locridis ales equos,
isque per aetherias me tollens avolat umbras
     et Veneris casto collocat in gremio.
ipsa suum Zephyritis eo famulum legarat
     Graiia Canopitis incola litoribus.
hi dii ven ibi vario ne solum in lumine caeli
     ex Ariadnaeis aurea temporibus
fixa corona foret, sed nos quoque fulgeremus
     deuotae flavi verticis exuviae,
vuidulam a fluctu cedentem ad templa deum me
     sidus in antiquis diva novum posuit.
Virginis et saevi contingens namque Leonis
     lumina, Callisto iuncta Lycaoniae,
vertor in occasum, tardum dux ante Booten,
     qui vix sero alto mergitur Oceano.
