LXVI.

Omnia qui magni dispexit lumina mundi,
     qui stellarum ortus comperit atque obitus,
flammeus ut rapidi solis nitor obscuretur,
     ut cedant certis sidera temporibus,
ut Triviam furtim sub Latmia saxa relegans
     dulcis amor gyro devocet aereo:
idem me ille Conon caelesti in limine vidit
     e Beroniceo vertice caesariem
fulgentem clare, quam multis illa dearum
     levia protendens brachia pollicita est,
qua rex tempestate novo auctus hymenaeo
     vastatum finis iuerat Assyrios,
dulcia nocturnae portans vestigia rixae,
     quam de virgineis gesserat exuviis.
estne novis nuptis odio Venus? anne parentum
     frustrantur falsis gaudia lacrimulis,
ubertim thalami quas intra limina fundunt?
     non, ita me divi, vera gemunt, iuerint.
id mea me multis docuit regina querellis
     invisente novo proelia torva viro.
et tu non orbum luxti deserta cubile,
     sed fratris cari flebile discidium?

He who discovered all the lights of the great world,
  who ascertained the risings and the settings of the stars,
(him)flaming so that the splendor of the racing sun is obscured,
  so that the constellations go away in certain seasons,
so that, banishing Trivia, stones furtively under Latmius,
  sweet love summons in a airy circle:
likewise that famed Conon saw in a heavenly light/threshold
  the flowing hair out of the Beronician eddy/peak 
flashing clearly, (hair) that she promised with/by many things of goddesses,
  stretching forth smooth/light branches,
in which season the king, enlarged by a new marriage,
  had come to lay waste to land of the Assyrians,
bringing the sweet traces of a nocturnal battle,
  that he had waged concerning maidenly spoils.
Is not Venus by/to the new brides by/to hatred?  Can it be that the parents'
  joys are disappointed by false little tears,
that the bedrooms copiously pour out within the house?
  No, thus by me the gods, truths lament, will/would pass/walk.
My queen taught me  with many complaints
  visiting to/by a new man/husband savage battles.
And you did not mourn the bereft/childless man with a deserted bed,
  but the lamentable parting of a dear brother?
