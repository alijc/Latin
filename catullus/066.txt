LXVI.

Omnia qui magni dispexit lumina mundi,
     qui stellarum ortus comperit atque obitus,
flammeus ut rapidi solis nitor obscuretur,
     ut cedant certis sidera temporibus,
ut Triviam furtim sub Latmia saxa relegans
     dulcis amor gyro devocet aereo:
idem me ille Conon caelesti in limine vidit
     e Beroniceo vertice caesariem
fulgentem clare, quam multis illa dearum
     levia protendens brachia pollicita est,
qua rex tempestate novo auctus hymenaeo
     vastatum finis iuerat Assyrios,
dulcia nocturnae portans vestigia rixae,
     quam de virgineis gesserat exuviis.
estne novis nuptis odio Venus? anne parentum
     frustrantur falsis gaudia lacrimulis,
ubertim thalami quas intra limina fundunt?
     non, ita me divi, vera gemunt, iuerint.
id mea me multis docuit regina querellis
     invisente novo proelia torva viro.
et tu non orbum luxti deserta cubile,
     sed fratris cari flebile discidium?

He who discerned all the lights of the spacious heavens,
  who ascertained the risings and the settings of the stars,
how the fiery splendor of the scorching sun is obscured,
  how the constellations go away in certain seasons,
how sweet love summons Trivia/Diana from her celestrial orbit,
  stealthily slipping her out of sight beneath the rock of Latmus:
that same renowned Conon saw in the heavenly house
  me, the flowing hair from Berenice's head,
brightly gleaming, hair that she promised to many goddesses,
  stretching forth her smooth arms,
in the time that the king, enlarged by a new marriage,
  had gone to lay waste to land of the Assyrians,
carrying the sweet traces of a nocturnal battle,
  in which he had borne off her maidenly spoils.
Is Venus hateful to new brides?  Are parents'
  joys are frustrated by false tears,
that they pour out copiously within their chamber's threshold?
  By my gods, they do not truly lament, they would have passed.
My queen taught this to me with her many complaints
  when her new husband went off to fierce battles.
And didn't you, deserted, mourn, not the empty bed,
  but the doleful separation of a dear brother?
