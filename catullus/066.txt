LXVI.

Omnia qui magni dispexit lumina mundi,
     qui stellarum ortus comperit atque obitus,
flammeus ut rapidi solis nitor obscuretur,
     ut cedant certis sidera temporibus,
ut Triviam furtim sub Latmia saxa relegans
     dulcis amor gyro devocet aereo:
idem me ille Conon caelesti in limine vidit
     e Beroniceo vertice caesariem
fulgentem clare, quam multis illa dearum
     levia protendens brachia pollicita est,
qua rex tempestate novo auctus hymenaeo
     vastatum finis iuerat Assyrios,
dulcia nocturnae portans vestigia rixae,
     quam de virgineis gesserat exuviis.
estne novis nuptis odio Venus? anne parentum
     frustrantur falsis gaudia lacrimulis,
ubertim thalami quas intra limina fundunt?
     non, ita me divi, vera gemunt, iuerint.
id mea me multis docuit regina querellis
     invisente novo proelia torva viro.
et tu non orbum luxti deserta cubile,
     sed fratris cari flebile discidium?
quam penitus maestas exedit cura medullas!
     ut tibi tunc toto pectore sollicitae
sensibus ereptis mens excidit! at ego certe
     cognoram a parva virgine magnanimam.
anne bonum oblita es facinus, quo regium adepta es
     coniugium, quod non fortior ausit alis?
sed tum maesta virum mittens quae verba locuta est!
     Iuppiter, ut tristi lumina saepe manu!
quis te mutavit tantus deus? an quod amantes
     non longe a caro corpore abesse volunt?
atque ibi me cunctis pro dulci coniuge divis
     non sine taurino sanguine pollicita es,
si reditum tetulisset. is haut in tempore longo
     captam Asiam Aegypti finibus addiderat.
quis ego pro factis caelesti reddita coetu
     pristina vota novo munere dissolvo.
invita, o regina, tuo de vertice cessi,
     invita: adiuro teque tuumque caput,
digna ferat quod si quis inaniter adiurarit:
     sed qui se ferro postulet esse parem?
ille quoque eversus mons est, quem maximum in oris
     progenies Thiae clara supervehitur,
cum Medi peperere novum mare, cumque iuventus
     per medium classi barbara navit Athon.
quid facient crines, cum ferro talia cedant?
     Iuppiter, ut Chalybon omne genus pereat,
et qui principio sub terra quaerere venas
     institit ac ferri stringere duritiem!
abiunctae paulo ante comae mea fata sorores
     lugebant, cum se Memnonis Aethiopis
unigena impellens nutantibus aera pennis
     obtulit Arsinoes Locridis ales equos,
isque per aetherias me tollens avolat umbras
     et Veneris casto collocat in gremio.
ipsa suum Zephyritis eo famulum legarat
     Graiia Canopitis incola litoribus.
hi dii ven ibi vario ne solum in lumine caeli
     ex Ariadnaeis aurea temporibus
fixa corona foret, sed nos quoque fulgeremus
     deuotae flavi verticis exuviae,
vuidulam a fluctu cedentem ad templa deum me
     sidus in antiquis diva novum posuit.
Virginis et saevi contingens namque Leonis
     lumina, Callisto iuncta Lycaoniae,
vertor in occasum, tardum dux ante Booten,
     qui vix sero alto mergitur Oceano.

sed quamquam me nocte premunt vestigia divum,
     lux autem canae Tethyi restituit
(pace tua fari hic liceat, Ramnusia virgo,
     namque ego non ullo vera timore tegam,
nec si me infestis discerpent sidera dictis,
     condita quin veri pectoris evoluam),
non his tam laetor rebus, quam me afore semper,
     afore me a dominae vertice discrucior,
quicum ego, dum virgo quondam fuit omnibus expers
     unguentis, una milia multa bibi.

nunc vos, optato quas iunxit lumine taeda,
     non prius unanimis corpora coniugibus
tradite nudantes reiecta veste papillas,
     quam iucunda mihi munera libet onyx,
vester onyx, casto colitis quae iura cubili.
     sed quae se impuro dedit adulterio,
illius a mala dona levis bibat irrita pulvis:
     namque ego ab indignis praemia nulla peto.
sed magis, o nuptae, semper concordia vestras,
     semper amor sedes incolat assiduus.
tu vero, regina, tuens cum sidera divam
     placabis festis luminibus Venerem,
unguinis expertem non siris esse tuam me,
     sed potius largis affice muneribus.
sidera corruerint utinam! coma regia fiam,
     proximus Hydrochoi fulgeret Oarion!


He who discerned all the lights of the spacious heavens,
  who ascertained the risings and the settings of the stars,
how the fiery splendor of the scorching sun is obscured,
  how the constellations go away in certain seasons,
how sweet love summons Trivia/Diana from her celestrial orbit,
  stealthily slipping her out of sight beneath the rock of Latmus:
that same renowned Conon saw in the heavenly house
  me, the flowing hair from Berenice's head,
brightly gleaming, hair that she promised to many goddesses,
  stretching out her delicate arms,
in the time that the king, enlarged by a new marriage,
  had gone to lay waste to land of the Assyrians,
carrying the sweet traces of the nocturnal battle
  in which he had borne off her maidenly spoils.
Is Venus hateful to new brides?  Are parents'
  joys are frustrated by the false tears
that pour out copiously within the chamber's threshold?
  By my gods, they do not truly lament, they will pass.
My queen taught this to me with her many complaints
  when her new husband went off to fierce battles.
And didn't you, deserted, mourn, not the empty bed,
  but the doleful separation of a dear brother?
How deeply care did eat away your sorrowful soul!
  As it then fell to you, upset with shredded feelings,
with your whole heart!  But surely I knew you,
  magnanimous, since you were a small child.
Have you forgotten the noble deed with which you gained a regal
  spouse, that no one else more boldly dared?
But then, sending your husband off, you spoke those melancholy words!
  Jupiter! How often you wiped your eyes with your hand!
Which great god changed you?  Can it be that lovers
  are no longer willing to be far from a dear body?
And there you promised me to all the gods for the sake of your sweet spouse,
  not without a bull's blood,
if he would return safely.  He had, in short order,
  added captive Asia to Egypt's bounds.
On account of this in a celestial union I,
  your former vow, was returned and to a new service released.
Reluctantly, o queen, did I leave your crown,
  reluctantly: I swear to you and to your head,
that if anyone swears in vain, may he get what he deserves:
  but who would claim himself equal to a sword?
Even that mountain range, the greatest in the world, that
  the shining progeny of Thia passes by, was uprooted
when the Medeans created a new sea, when their youth 
  sailed a foreign fleet through the Athos Mountains.
What can hair do, when such as me fall to steel?
  Jupiter, let the entire nation of Chalybes perish,
and the one who first strove to seek veins under the earth
  and to shape unbending iron!
Locks of hair, at my severing, my sisters were mourning my fate, 
  when the Ethiopian Memnon's brother,
rushing forward with wings that beat the air,
  the winged horse, presented himself to Arsinoe Locride,
and he, picking me up, dashes off through the celestrial shadows
  and settles me in the chaste lap of Venus.
Zephyritis herself had sent her servant there,
  the Greek woman from Canopus, who lived by the sea.
The goddess Venus placed me, a new constellation, among the old ones,
  so that the golden wreath from Ariadne's temples,
fixed in the seasons, wouldn't be the only varying light in the sky,
  but that we might shine as well,
the pledged spoils of a blond head,
  wet from weeping, offered to the shrines of the gods.
For, butting against the lights of Virgo and of fierce Leo,
  harnessed to Callisto of Lycaonia,
I turn to the west, a guide in front of slow Bootes,
  who is barely dipped into the deep Ocean.

But though the footsteps of the gods stalk me in the night 
  and daytime restores me to old Tethys,
(by your grace let me here say, Nemesis,
  for I'd not conceal true matters from any fear,
even if the stars tear me to bits with hostile remarks,
  in fact I'll disclose them, settled with a true heart),
I am not so cheered by these things as I am tormented 
  that I will always be absent, that I'll be far from my lady's head,
with whom I, free from all perfumes, 
  alone drank many thousands while she was yet a maiden.

Now you, whom the torch has joined with the chosen light,
  don't hand your rejected bodies over to your single-minded spouses, 
laying bare your breasts from your garment before 
  it please you to let your onyx perfume box render delights to me,
your onyx box, you who seek your rights in a chaste bed.
  But the one who gives herself to foul adultery,
of her, ah, let the petty trifling dust swallow her vile gifts:
  for I ask no favors from unworthy people.
But rather, o brides, may concord and constant love
  forever dwell in your homes.
Truly you, queen, while gazing at the stars,
  will placate the divine Venus with a lamplit feast,
don't let me, who is yours, be free from oils,
  but rather affect me with lavish gifts.
If only the stars would fall!  Would that I became the regal hair,
  and Orion might gleam next to Aquarius!
