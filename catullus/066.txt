LXVI.

Omnia qui magni dispexit lumina mundi,
     qui stellarum ortus comperit atque obitus,
flammeus ut rapidi solis nitor obscuretur,
     ut cedant certis sidera temporibus,
ut Triviam furtim sub Latmia saxa relegans
     dulcis amor gyro devocet aereo:
idem me ille Conon caelesti in limine vidit
     e Beroniceo vertice caesariem
fulgentem clare, quam multis illa dearum
     levia protendens brachia pollicita est,
qua rex tempestate novo auctus hymenaeo
     vastatum finis iuerat Assyrios,
dulcia nocturnae portans vestigia rixae,
     quam de virgineis gesserat exuviis.
estne novis nuptis odio Venus? anne parentum
     frustrantur falsis gaudia lacrimulis,
ubertim thalami quas intra limina fundunt?
     non, ita me divi, vera gemunt, iuerint.
id mea me multis docuit regina querellis
     invisente novo proelia torva viro.
et tu non orbum luxti deserta cubile,
     sed fratris cari flebile discidium?

He who discovered all the lights of the great world,
  who calculated the risings and the settings of the stars,
flaming so that the splendor of the swift sun is obscured,
  so that the constellations pass away at certain times,
so that banishing Trivia furtively under the Latmian stone 
  sweet love summons with a airy/coppery ring:
likewise that Conon by a heavenly body on the threshold saw
  the flowing hair out of the Beronician eddy/peak 
flashing clearly, that by/to many things she of the goddesses
  stretching forth smooth branches she/he/it promised,
by which the king, enlarged in a storm by a new marriage,
  had walked the ravaged, the boundaries of Assyria.
bringing the sweet traces of the nocturnal brawl,
  that from the bride's booty he had carried.
Is not Venus by/to the new brides I by/to hatred?  Can it be of the parents
  the joys are disappointed by false little tears,
copiously (weeping) of the bedroom, which (tears) they pour withine the house?
  No, thus at/by me the gods, truths lament, will/would pass/walk.
It my things at/by me with many complaints the queen taught 
  visiting to/by a new man/husband savage battles.
And you did not shine > bereft/childless with a deserted bed,
  but of a dear brother doleful discord?
