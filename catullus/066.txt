LXVI.

Omnia qui magni dispexit lumina mundi,
     qui stellarum ortus comperit atque obitus,
flammeus ut rapidi solis nitor obscuretur,
     ut cedant certis sidera temporibus,
ut Triviam furtim sub Latmia saxa relegans
     dulcis amor gyro devocet aereo:
idem me ille Conon caelesti in limine vidit
     e Beroniceo vertice caesariem
fulgentem clare, quam multis illa dearum
     levia protendens brachia pollicita est,
qua rex tempestate novo auctus hymenaeo
     vastatum finis iuerat Assyrios,
dulcia nocturnae portans vestigia rixae,
     quam de virgineis gesserat exuviis.
estne novis nuptis odio Venus? anne parentum
     frustrantur falsis gaudia lacrimulis,
ubertim thalami quas intra limina fundunt?
     non, ita me divi, vera gemunt, iuerint.
id mea me multis docuit regina querellis
     invisente novo proelia torva viro.
et tu non orbum luxti deserta cubile,
     sed fratris cari flebile discidium?

He who discerned all the lights of the spacious heavens,
  who ascertained the risings and the settings of the stars,
how the fiery splendor of the scorching sun is obscured,
  how the constellations go away in certain seasons,
how sweet love summons Trivia/Diana from her celestrial orbit,
  stealthily slipping her out of sight beneath the rock of Latmus:
that same renowned Conon saw in the heavenly house
  me, the flowing hair from Berenice's head,
brightly gleaming, hair that she promised to many goddesses,
  stretching out her delicate arms,
in the time that the king, enlarged by a new marriage,
  had gone to lay waste to land of the Assyrians,
carrying the sweet traces of the nocturnal battle
  in which he had borne off her maidenly spoils.
Is Venus hateful to new brides?  Are parents'
  joys are frustrated by the false tears
that pour out copiously within the chamber's threshold?
  By my gods, they do not truly lament, they will pass.
My queen taught this to me with her many complaints
  when her new husband went off to fierce battles.
And didn't you, deserted, mourn, not the empty bed,
  but the doleful separation of a dear brother?


quam penitus maestas exedit cura medullas!
     ut tibi tunc toto pectore sollicitae
sensibus ereptis mens excidit! at ego certe
     cognoram a parva virgine magnanimam.
anne bonum oblita es facinus, quo regium adepta es
     coniugium, quod non fortior ausit alis?
sed tum maesta virum mittens quae verba locuta est!
     Iuppiter, ut tristi lumina saepe manu!
quis te mutavit tantus deus? an quod amantes
     non longe a caro corpore abesse volunt?
atque ibi me cunctis pro dulci coniuge divis
     non sine taurino sanguine pollicita es,
si reditum tetulisset. is haut in tempore longo
     captam Asiam Aegypti finibus addiderat.
quis ego pro factis caelesti reddita coetu
     pristina vota novo munere dissolvo.
invita, o regina, tuo de vertice cessi,
     invita: adiuro teque tuumque caput,
digna ferat quod si quis inaniter adiurarit:
     sed qui se ferro postulet esse parem?
ille quoque eversus mons est, quem maximum in oris
     progenies Thiae clara supervehitur,
cum Medi peperere novum mare, cumque iuventus
     per medium classi barbara navit Athon.

How deeply care does eat away your sorrowful soul!
  As it then fell to you, upset with shredded feelings,
with your whole heart! But I had surely
  learned generousity from the little maid.
Can it be that you have forgotten the good deed with which you gained a regal
  spouse, that a stronger man(?) would not dare with/to others?
But then, sending poison, your spoke those melancholy words!
  Jupiter, as you often wiped your eyes with your hand!
Who changed you, such a god?  Can it be your lovers
  were no longer willing to be far from your dear body?
And there you promised me by all the gods for a sweet spouse,
  not without a bull's blood,
if he would return safely.  He had, in short order,
  added captive Asia to Egypt's bounds.
Who I for deeds by a celestial meeting 
  her former vow returned and to a new service released.
Summon, o queen, what was taken from your crown,
  summon it: I swear to you and to your head,
may a worthy woman offer what if anyone swore in vain?
  But who would claim himself your equal with a sword?
That upturned mountains, the greatest on the rims, is likewise what
  the shining progeny of Thia passes by,
as the Medeans beget a new sea, whenever youth Athon
  sails through the middle from a foreign class / with a foriegn fleet.
