LXVI.

Omnia qui magni dispexit lumina mundi,
     qui stellarum ortus comperit atque obitus,
flammeus ut rapidi solis nitor obscuretur,
     ut cedant certis sidera temporibus,
ut Triviam furtim sub Latmia saxa relegans
     dulcis amor gyro devocet aereo:
idem me ille Conon caelesti in limine vidit
     e Beroniceo vertice caesariem
fulgentem clare, quam multis illa dearum
     levia protendens brachia pollicita est,
qua rex tempestate novo auctus hymenaeo
     vastatum finis iuerat Assyrios,
dulcia nocturnae portans vestigia rixae,
     quam de virgineis gesserat exuviis.
estne novis nuptis odio Venus? anne parentum
     frustrantur falsis gaudia lacrimulis,
ubertim thalami quas intra limina fundunt?
     non, ita me divi, vera gemunt, iuerint.
id mea me multis docuit regina querellis
     invisente novo proelia torva viro.
et tu non orbum luxti deserta cubile,
     sed fratris cari flebile discidium?

He who discerned all the lights of the spacious heavens,
  who ascertained the risings and the settings of the stars,
how the fiery splendor of the scorching sun is obscured,
  how the constellations go away in certain seasons,
how sweet love summons Trivia/Diana from her celestrial orbit,
  stealthily slipping her out of sight beneath the rock of Latmus:
that same renowned Conon saw in the heavenly house
  me, the flowing hair from Berenice's head,
brightly gleaming, hair that she promised to many goddesses,
  stretching out her delicate arms,
in the time that the king, enlarged by a new marriage,
  had gone to lay waste to land of the Assyrians,
carrying the sweet traces of the nocturnal battle
  in which he had borne off her maidenly spoils.
Is Venus hateful to new brides?  Are parents'
  joys are frustrated by the false tears
that pour out copiously within the chamber's threshold?
  By my gods, they do not truly lament, they will pass.
My queen taught this to me with her many complaints
  when her new husband went off to fierce battles.
And didn't you, deserted, mourn, not the empty bed,
  but the doleful separation of a dear brother?


quam penitus maestas exedit cura medullas!
     ut tibi tunc toto pectore sollicitae
sensibus ereptis mens excidit! at ego certe
     cognoram a parva virgine magnanimam.
anne bonum oblita es facinus, quo regium adepta es
     coniugium, quod non fortior ausit alis?
sed tum maesta virum mittens quae verba locuta est!
     Iuppiter, ut tristi lumina saepe manu!
quis te mutavit tantus deus? an quod amantes
     non longe a caro corpore abesse volunt?
atque ibi me cunctis pro dulci coniuge divis
     non sine taurino sanguine pollicita es,
si reditum tetulisset. is haut in tempore longo
     captam Asiam Aegypti finibus addiderat.
quis ego pro factis caelesti reddita coetu
     pristina vota novo munere dissolvo.
invita, o regina, tuo de vertice cessi,
     invita: adiuro teque tuumque caput,
digna ferat quod si quis inaniter adiurarit:
     sed qui se ferro postulet esse parem?
ille quoque eversus mons est, quem maximum in oris
     progenies Thiae clara supervehitur,
cum Medi peperere novum mare, cumque iuventus
     per medium classi barbara navit Athon.

How thoroughly care consume(d/s) sad innermost parts!
  as to you, upset, then with your whole heart
with snatched-away feelings it destroyed! But I surely
  had learned from the small maiden a generous.
Can it be that you have forgotten the good, with which you gained a regal
  spouse, that not stronger would dare with/to wings?
But then the sad woman, sending the man, woman who said the (sad?) words!
  Jupiter, while you often rubbed out the lamp with your hand!
Who changed you, such a god?  Can it be your lovers
  no longer from dear body wished to be absent?
And there >me to/by all the gods for sweet union/consort 
  not without to/by bull's blood you promised,
if it would have borne a return.  He not at all in a long time 
  had increased captured Asia to Egypt's territory.
By/to whom I for deeds by a celestial meeting delivered
  former vow to/by new service released.
Summon, o queen, from your peak of retired,
  summon: I swear to you and to your head,
may a worthy woman bring what if anyone swore in vain?
  But he who would claim with a sword to be your equal?
That upturned mountain likewise is what the greatest on the coasts
  the famous woman passes the progeny of Thia,
as the Medeas give birth to a new sea, at any time a youth
  through the middle to/by a class a foreign woman sails Athon.
