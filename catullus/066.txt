LXVI.

Omnia qui magni dispexit lumina mundi,
     qui stellarum ortus comperit atque obitus,
flammeus ut rapidi solis nitor obscuretur,
     ut cedant certis sidera temporibus,
ut Triviam furtim sub Latmia saxa relegans
     dulcis amor gyro devocet aereo:
idem me ille Conon caelesti in limine vidit
     e Beroniceo vertice caesariem
fulgentem clare, quam multis illa dearum
     levia protendens brachia pollicita est,
qua rex tempestate novo auctus hymenaeo
     vastatum finis iuerat Assyrios,
dulcia nocturnae portans vestigia rixae,
     quam de virgineis gesserat exuviis.
estne novis nuptis odio Venus? anne parentum
     frustrantur falsis gaudia lacrimulis,
ubertim thalami quas intra limina fundunt?
     non, ita me divi, vera gemunt, iuerint.
id mea me multis docuit regina querellis
     invisente novo proelia torva viro.
et tu non orbum luxti deserta cubile,
     sed fratris cari flebile discidium?

He who discovered all the lights of the spacious heavens,
  who ascertained the risings and the settings of the stars,
so that the fiery splendor of the scorching sun is obscured,
  so that the constellations go away in certain seasons,
so that, furtively banishing Trivia under the rock of Latmus,
  sweet love summons in a celestrial circle:
that same renowned Conon saw in the heavenly house
  the flowing hair from Berenice's head
clearly gleaming, hair that she promised to many goddesses,
  stretching forth her smooth arms,
in the time that the king, enlarged by a new marriage,
  had gone to lay waste to land of the Assyrians,
bringing the sweet traces of a nocturnal battle,
  that he had waged concerning maidenly spoils.
Is not Venus by/to the new brides by/to hatred?  Can it be that the parents'
  joys are disappointed by false little tears,
that the bedrooms copiously pour out within the house?
  No, thus by me the gods, truths lament, will/would pass/walk.
My queen taught me  with many complaints
  visiting to/by a new man/husband savage battles.
And you did not mourn the bereft/childless man with a deserted bed,
  but the lamentable parting of a dear brother?
