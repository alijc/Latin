LXVII. de ianua moechae cuiusdam 

O dulci iucunda virgo, iucunda parenti,
     salve, teque bona Iuppiter auctet ope,
ianua, quam Balbo dicunt servisse benigne
     olim, cum sedes ipse senex tenuit,
quamque ferunt rursus gnato servisse maligne,
     postquam es porrecto facta marita sene.
dic agedum nobis, quare mutata feraris
     in dominum veterem deseruisse fidem.
'Non (ita Caecilio placeam, cui tradita nunc sum)
     culpa mea est, quamquam dicitur esse mea,
nec peccatum a me quisquam pote dicere quicquam:
     verum istius populi ianua qui te facit,
qui quacumque aliquid reperitur non bene factum
     ad me omnes clamant: ianua, culpa tua est.'
Non istuc satis est uno te dicere verbo.
     sed facere ut quivis sentiat et videat.
'Qui possum? nemo quaerit nec scire laborat?'
     Nos volumus: nobis dicere ne dubita.
'Primum igitur, virgo quod fertur tradita nobis,
     falsum est. non illam vir prior attigerit,
languidior tenera cui pendens sicula beta.
     numquam se mediam sustulit ad tunicam;
sed pater illius gnati violasse cubile
     dicitur et miseram conscelerasse domum,
sive quod impia mens caeco flagrabat amore,
     seu quod iners sterili semine natus erat,
ut quaerendum unde foret nervosius illud,
     quod posset zonam solvere virgineam.'
Egregium narras mira pietate parentem.
     qui ipse sui gnati minxerit in gremium.
Atqui non solum hoc dicit se cognitum habere
     Brixia Cycneae supposita speculae,
flavus quam molli praecurrit flumine Mella,
     Brixia Veronae mater amata meae,
sed de Postumio et Corneli narrat amore,
     cum quibus illa malum fecit adulterium.


LXVII. Concerning the door of a certain slut

O, delight to a good husband, delight to a parent,
  greetings, may Jupiter bless you with good aid,
Door, they say you served Balbus well once,
  when the old man himself owned the house,
but conversely, they declare you served the son with spite
  after the old man was laid out and you fell to a bride.
Come, tell us, how you came to be changed
  to have forsaken your fealty to your aged lord.

"It isn't (thus may I please Caecilius, to whom I now belong)
  my fault, though it is said to be mine,
nor can anyone name any sin of mine:
  that truth of your people who made you, door,
who, whenever anything is found to be poorly done,
  all shout at me: 'Door, it's all your fault.'"

It is not enough for you to say one word to that,
  but to make anyone think and see.

"How can I?  No one asks or takes pains to know."

  We wish it: don't hesitate to speak to us.

"First off, therefore, a virgin, so they say, was brought to us.
  It is a lie.  Her first husband did not touch her,
his dick, hanging limper than a delicate beet,
  itself never lifted the front of his shirt.

But it's said that that man's father dishonored his bed
  and disgraced his wretched home,
either because his wicked mind blazed with secret love,
  or because the son had been born inert, with sterile seed,
from whence he must needs seek some bolder thing,
  that could undo a maiden's belt."

You tell about an extraordinary parent with remarkable devotion,
  who pissed in his own son's lap.

But Brixia, set under the watch tower of the Swan,
  says that she has yet knowledge not only of this,
(a blond man passes her on the calm Mella River,
  Brixia, the mother of my beloved Verona)
but she tells of the love of Postumius and Cornelius,
  with whom she has committed vile adultery.


dixerit hic aliquis: quid? tu istaec, ianua, nosti,
     cui numquam domini limine abesse licet,
nec populum auscultare, sed hic suffixa tigillo
     tantum operire soles aut aperire domum?
saepe illam audivi furtiva voce loquentem
     solam cum ancillis haec sua flagitia,
nomine dicentem quos diximus, utpote quae mi
     speraret nec linguam esse nec auriculam.
praeterea addebat quendam, quem dicere nolo
     nomine, ne tollat rubra supercilia.
longus homo est, magnas cui lites intulit olim
     falsum mendaci ventre puerperium.' 

Here anyone might say: What?  You, door, knew those things?
  You who are never allowed to be away from the master's threshold,
and cannot overhear, but, hinged to a beam, 
  only to block the sun or to lay open the house?

Often I have heard her, alone with her maidservants,
  telling these her shames in a furtive voice,
calling by name those whom we named, in as much as 
  she would trust me to be neither tongue or ear.
Besides, she added a certain man, whom I don't
  want to call by name, lest he raise his red eyebrows.
A tall man is he, on whom she once inflicted a nasty lawsuit -
  a false pregnancy with a deceitful womb.
