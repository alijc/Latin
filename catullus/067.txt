LXVII. de ianua moechae cuiusdam 

O dulci iucunda virgo, iucunda parenti,
     salve, teque bona Iuppiter auctet ope,
ianua, quam Balbo dicunt servisse benigne
     olim, cum sedes ipse senex tenuit,
quamque ferunt rursus gnato servisse maligne,
     postquam es porrecto facta marita sene.
dic agedum nobis, quare mutata feraris
     in dominum veterem deseruisse fidem.
'Non (ita Caecilio placeam, cui tradita nunc sum)
     culpa mea est, quamquam dicitur esse mea,
nec peccatum a me quisquam pote dicere quicquam:
     verum istius populi ianua qui te facit,
qui quacumque aliquid reperitur non bene factum
     ad me omnes clamant: ianua, culpa tua est.'
Non istuc satis est uno te dicere verbo.
     sed facere ut quivis sentiat et videat.
'Qui possum? nemo quaerit nec scire laborat?'
     Nos volumus: nobis dicere ne dubita.
'Primum igitur, virgo quod fertur tradita nobis,
     falsum est. non illam vir prior attigerit,
languidior tenera cui pendens sicula beta.
     numquam se mediam sustulit ad tunicam;


LXVII. Concerning the door of a certain slut

O, delight to a good husband, delight to a parent,
  greetings, may Jupiter bless you with good aid,
Door, they say you served Balbus well once,
  when the old man himself owned the house,
but conversely, they declare you served the son with spite
  after the old man was laid out and you fell to a bride.
Come, tell us, how you came to be changed
  to have forsaken your fealty to your aged lord.

"It isn't (thus may I please Caecilius, to whom I now belong)
  my fault, though it is said to be mine,
nor can anyone name any sin of mine:
  that truth of your people who made you, door,
who, whenever anything is found to be poorly done,
  all shout at me: 'Door, it's all your fault.'"

It is not enough for you to say one word to that,
  but to make anyone think and see.

"How can I?  No one asks or takes pains to know."

  We wish it: don't hesitate to speak to us.

"First off, therefore, a virgin, so they say, was brought to us.
  It is a lie.  Her first husband did not touch her,
his dick, hanging limper than a delicate beet,
  itself never lifted the front of his shirt.
