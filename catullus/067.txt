LXVII. de ianua moechae cuiusdam 

O dulci iucunda virgo, iucunda parenti,
     salve, teque bona Iuppiter auctet ope,
ianua, quam Balbo dicunt servisse benigne
     olim, cum sedes ipse senex tenuit,
quamque ferunt rursus gnato servisse maligne,
     postquam es porrecto facta marita sene.
dic agedum nobis, quare mutata feraris
     in dominum veterem deseruisse fidem.
'Non (ita Caecilio placeam, cui tradita nunc sum)
     culpa mea est, quamquam dicitur esse mea,
nec peccatum a me quisquam pote dicere quicquam:
     verum istius populi ianua qui te facit,
qui quacumque aliquid reperitur non bene factum
     ad me omnes clamant: ianua, culpa tua est.'
Non istuc satis est uno te dicere verbo.
     sed facere ut quivis sentiat et videat.
'Qui possum? nemo quaerit nec scire laborat?'
     Nos volumus: nobis dicere ne dubita.
'Primum igitur, virgo quod fertur tradita nobis,
     falsum est. non illam vir prior attigerit,
languidior tenera cui pendens sicula beta.
     numquam se mediam sustulit ad tunicam;


LXVII. Concerning the door of a certain slut

O, delight to a good husband, delight to a parent,
  greetings, may Jupiter bless you with good aid,
Door, they say you served Balbus well once,
  when the old man himself owned the house,
but conversely, they declare you served the son with spite
  after the old man was laid out and you fell to a bride.
Come, tell us, how you came to be changed
  to have forsaken your fealty to your aged lord.

"It isn't (thus may I please Caecilius, to whom I now belong)
  my fault, though it is said to be mine,
nor can anyone name any sin of mine:
  that truth of your people who made you, door,
who, whenever anything is found to be poorly done,
  all shout at me: 'Door, it's all your fault.'"

It is not enough for you to say one word to that,
  but to make anyone think and see.

"How can I?  No one asks or takes pains to know."

  We wish it: don't hesitate to speak to us.

"First off, therefore, a virgin, so they say, was brought to us.
  It is a lie.  Her first husband did not touch her,
his dick, hanging limper than a delicate beet,
  itself never lifted the front of his shirt.


sed pater illius gnati violasse cubile
     dicitur et miseram conscelerasse domum,
sive quod impia mens caeco flagrabat amore,
     seu quod iners sterili semine natus erat,
ut quaerendum unde foret nervosius illud,
     quod posset zonam solvere virgineam.'
Egregium narras mira pietate parentem.
     qui ipse sui gnati minxerit in gremium.
Atqui non solum hoc dicit se cognitum habere
     Brixia Cycneae supposita speculae,
flavus quam molli praecurrit flumine Mella,
     Brixia Veronae mater amata meae,
sed de Postumio et Corneli narrat amore,
     cum quibus illa malum fecit adulterium.

But that son's father to have dishonored the bed
  is said and to have disgraced his wretched home,
or if that/because a wicked mind with blind love blazes,
  of if that/because helpless with barren seed he had been born,
in order to seeking from where he might be ??? that thing,
  that/because he might be able to loosen the virgin's girdle."

You tell about an extraordinary parent with remarkable tenderness.
  Who himself of his own son pissed in his lap.
But yet not only says this that he has known
  Brixia of the Swan placed under of a glimmer of hope/watch tower,
blond man >whom(f) to soft ran/runs before by the river the Mella,
  Brixia of Verona the mother beloved of mine,
but from Postumius and Cornelius she talks to love,
  as by/to whom she made evil adultery.
