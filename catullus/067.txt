LXVII. de ianua moechae cuiusdam 

O dulci iucunda virgo, iucunda parenti,
     salve, teque bona Iuppiter auctet ope,
ianua, quam Balbo dicunt servisse benigne
     olim, cum sedes ipse senex tenuit,
quamque ferunt rursus gnato servisse maligne,
     postquam es porrecto facta marita sene.
dic agedum nobis, quare mutata feraris
     in dominum veterem deseruisse fidem.
'Non (ita Caecilio placeam, cui tradita nunc sum)
     culpa mea est, quamquam dicitur esse mea,
nec peccatum a me quisquam pote dicere quicquam:
     verum istius populi ianua qui te facit,
qui quacumque aliquid reperitur non bene factum
     ad me omnes clamant: ianua, culpa tua est.'
Non istuc satis est uno te dicere verbo.
     sed facere ut quivis sentiat et videat.
'Qui possum? nemo quaerit nec scire laborat?'
     Nos volumus: nobis dicere ne dubita.
'Primum igitur, virgo quod fertur tradita nobis,
     falsum est. non illam vir prior attigerit,
languidior tenera cui pendens sicula beta.
     numquam se mediam sustulit ad tunicam;


LXVII. On the door of a certain slut

O delightful maiden to a sweet, delightful to a parent,
  greetings, may Jupiter bless you with good power,
a door which with stammering they say to have bound benevolently
  once, while you sit the old man himself keeps,
and which they carry back to the son to have served spitefully,
  after you are by/to extended deed married to an old man.
Come, tell us, how/why you are brought changed
  into the old master to have departed/devoted yourself to faith.
"It isn't (thus may I please Caecilius, to whom I have now been handed over)
  my fault, though it is said to be mine,
nor sin from me whoever can say anything:
  that truth of yours the door of poplar who made you,
who with whatever anything is discovered not well made
  to me they all shout: door, it's your fault."
It is not to there enough by one word you to say.
  But to make so that whoever might think and might see.
"How can I? Does no one seek or takes pain to know?"
  We want: for us to speak that you have no doubt.
"Therefore first thing, maiden because she is brought delivered to us,
  she was deceived.  Not >that woman husband touched earlier,
weaker tender to whom hanging dick beet.
  never >self >middle endured to the shirt.
