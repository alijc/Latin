LXVIII. ad Manlium 

(a)
Quod mihi fortuna casuque oppressus acerbo
     conscriptum hoc lacrimis mittis epistolium,
naufragum ut eiectum spumantibus aequoris undis
     sublevem et a mortis limine restituam,
quem neque sancta Venus molli requiescere somno
     desertum in lecto caelibe perpetitur,
nec veterum dulci scriptorum carmine Musae
     oblectant, cum mens anxia pervigilat:
id gratum est mihi, me quoniam tibi dicis amicum,
     muneraque et Musarum hinc petis et Veneris.
sed tibi ne mea sint ignota incommoda, Mani,
     neu me odisse putes hospitis officium,
accipe, quis merser fortunae fluctibus ipse,
     ne amplius a misero dona beata petas.
tempore quo primum vestis mihi tradita pura est,
     iucundum cum aetas florida ver ageret,
multa satis lusi: non est dea nescia nostri,
     quae dulcem curis miscet amaritiem.
sed totum hoc studium luctu fraterna mihi mors
     abstulit. o misero frater adempte mihi,
tu mea tu moriens fregisti commoda, frater,
     tecum una tota est nostra sepulta domus,
omnia tecum una perierunt gaudia nostra,
     quae tuus in vita dulcis alebat amor. 
cuius ego interitu tota de mente fugavi
     haec studia atque omnes delicias animi.
quare, quod scribis Veronae turpe Catullo
     esse, quod hic quisquis de meliore nota
frigida deserto tepefactet membra cubili,
     id, Mani, non est turpe, magis miserum est.
ignosces igitur si, quae mihi luctus ademit,
     haec tibi non tribuo munera, cum nequeo.
nam, quod scriptorum non magna est copia apud me,
     hoc fit, quod Romae vivimus: illa domus,
illa mihi sedes, illic mea carpitur aetas;
     huc una ex multis capsula me sequitur.
quod cum ita sit, nolim statuas nos mente maligna
     id facere aut animo non satis ingenuo,
quod tibi non utriusque petenti copia posta est:
     ultro ego deferrem, copia siqua foret. [end of 68a]


LXVIII. to Manlius

Because you, overwhelmed by fortune and bitter mischance,
  send me this letter, composed in tears,
so that I might lift you up, wrecked and cast off by the foamy waves of the sea 
  and restore you from the threshold of death,
you whom Divine Venus does not allow to rest in a soft slumber,
  forsaken in your widower's bed.
Nor do the muses divert you with a sweet song of the ancient poets, 
  while your uneasy mind keeps vigil.
I am grateful that you call me friend
  and ask favors of both Venus and the Muses.
But so that my misfortunes not be unknown to you Manlius,
  and that you do not suppose that I hate the duties of a host,
hear, of those waves of fortune that I myself drown in,
  so that you'll no longer beg joyful gifts from a wretched man.
At the time when a man's toga was first handed to me,
  when a blooming age passed a pleasant spring,
I sported well enough: the goddess was not unknown to us
  who mixes a sweet bitterness with our cares.
But my brother's death has snatched all this zeal away from me 
  with lamentation.  O brother, taken away from wretched me,
in dying, brother, you have dashed my gifts to bits,
  our whole house is entombed together with you,
all our joys have died together with you,
  which your love nourished in your sweet life.
With his death I have completely routed from my mind
  these passions and all the pleasures of my soul.

And so, because you write that it's a shame for Catullus to be in Verona,
  because here someone of better note
would warm your freezing limbs in your lonely bed,
  that, Manlius, is not a shame, rather, it's a misfortune.
And so you'll excuse me if grief has taken from me
  these services that I do not bestow on you, as I cannot.
For, because there aren't a great many writings at my house,
  let this be, because we live in Rome: that house,
that home of mine, there my life is spent;
  only one of my many boxes of books has followed me here.
Since it is so, I'd not wish for you to think that we do 
  this with a spiteful mind or with a soul not noble enough,
because a sufficiency of either desire was not granted you:
  I'd bring off both, if there were enough.


(b)
Non possum reticere, deae, qua me Allius in re [start of 68 b]
iuuerit aut quantis iuverit officiis,
ne fugiens saeclis obliviscentibus aetas
illius hoc caeca nocte tegat studium:
sed dicam vobis, vos porro dicite multis
milibus et facite haec carta loquatur anus.
notescatque magis mortuus atque magis,
nec tenuem texens sublimis aranea telam
in deserto Alli nomine opus faciat.
nam, mihi quam dederit duplex Amathusia curam,
scitis, et in quo me torruerit genere,
cum tantum arderem quantum Trinacria rupes
lymphaque in Oetaeis Malia Thermopylis,
maesta neque assiduo tabescere lumina fletu
cessarent. tristique imbre madere genae.
qualis in aerii perlucens vertice montis
riuus muscoso prosilit e lapide,
qui cum de prona praeceps est valle volutus,
per medium densi transit iter populi,
dulce viatori lasso in sudore levamen,
cum gravis exustos aestus hiulcat agros:
hic, velut in nigro iactatis turbine nautis
lenius aspirans aura secunda venit
iam prece Pollucis, iam Castoris implorata,
tale fuit nobis Allius auxilium.
is clausum lato patefecit limite campum,
isque domum nobis isque dedit dominae,
ad quam communes exerceremus amores.
quo mea se molli candida diva pede
intulit et trito fulgentem in limine plantam
     innixa arguta constituit solea,
coniugis ut quondam flagrans advenit amore
     Protesilaeam Laodamia domum
inceptam frustra, nondum cum sanguine sacro
     hostia caelestis pacificasset eros.
nil mihi tam valde placeat, Ramnusia virgo,
     quod temere invitis suscipiatur eris.
quam ieiuna pium desiderat ara cruorem,
     docta est amisso Laudamia viro,
coniugis ante coacta novi dimittere collum,
     quam veniens una atque altera rursus hiems
noctibus in longis avidum saturasset amorem,
     posset ut abrupto vivere coniugio,
quod scibant Parcae non longo tempore abesse,
     si miles muros isset ad Iliacos.
nam tum Helenae raptu primores Argiuorum
     coeperat ad sese Troia ciere viros,
Troia (nefas!) commune sepulcrum Asiae Europaeque,
     Troia virum et virtutum omnium acerba cinis,
quaene etiam nostro letum miserabile fratri
     attulit. ei misero frater adempte mihi
ei misero fratri iucundum lumen ademptum,
     tecum una tota est nostra sepulta domus,
omnia tecum una perierunt gaudia nostra,
     quae tuus in vita dulcis alebat amor.

quem nunc tam longe non inter nota sepulcra
nec prope cognatos compositum cineres,
sed Troia obscena, Troia infelice sepultum
detinet extremo terra aliena solo.
ad quam tum properans fertur undique pubes
Graecae penetralis deseruisse focos,
ne Paris abducta gavisus libera moecha
otia pacato degeret in thalamo.
quo tibi tum casu, pulcerrima Laudamia,
ereptum est vita dulcius atque anima
coniugium: tanto te absorbens vertice amoris
aestus in abruptum detulerat barathrum,
quale ferunt Grai Pheneum prope Cylleneum
siccare emulsa pingue palude solum,
quod quondam caesis montis fodisse medullis
audit falsiparens Amphitryoniades,
tempore quo certa Stymphalia monstra sagitta
perculit imperio deterioris eri,
pluribus ut caeli tereretur ianua divis,
Hebe nec longa virginitate foret.
sed tuus altus amor barathro fuit altior illo,
qui tamen indomitam ferre iugum docuit.


I cannot conceal, godesses, how in this matter Allius
did aid me, or with how many favors he did aid me,
lest the fleeing age, for forgotten generations, 
should conceal his zeal in this unseeing night:
but I will tell you: speak in time to come to many
thousands and make this old-maidenly letter give speech.
And let the dead become known more and more,
and let not a lofty spider work a finely woven cobweb
upon the forgotten name of Allius.
For you know how two-faced Amathusia gave me trouble,
and in what manner she overwhelmed me,
when I blazed like a Trinacrian cliff
and like the Malian spring in Oetaean Thermopylae,
and my sorrowful eyes didn't leave off constantly dissolving
in tears, or my cheeks from flowing with a rain of sorrow.
As a clear stream springs forth from the mossy rock
on a mountain peak high in the sky,
which, after rolling headlong down a steep valley,
pases the road in the middle of a poplar thicket,
sweet solace to a weary sweating traveler,
when a stifling heat splits open the dried out fields:
as to sailors, tossed by a black whirlwind,
a fair breeze comes, blowing more gently,
now with a prayer to Pollux, now with an entreaty to Castor,
such to us was Allius' aid.
He opened up the closed plain with a broad path,
and he gave his house to us and to my lady,
where we might cultivate our common loves.
And my fair goddess betook herself on tender feet,
onto the well-worn threshold she set her bright sole,
  supported by an melodious sandal,
just as Laodamia once, burning with love for her husband,
  came to Protesilaus' home, a household vainly started,
since no sacrifice had yet appeased
  the heavenly lords with its sacred blood.
Nothing gives me great pleasure, Ramnusian maiden,
  that is rashly taken up by these unwilling lords.
How hungrily had the altar called for righteous blood,
  Laodamia was taught by her departed husband,
compelled to give up the neck of her new spouse
  before the winter, come once and come again,
when she might sate her eager love in the long nights,
  to let her survive her broken marriage.
The Fates knew it to be not far off
  for a soldier who had gone to the walls of Troy.
For then, with Helen's kidnapping, Troy had begun
  to rouse to herself the foremost men of Argos,
Troy (wicked!) the common tomb of Asia and Europe,
  bitter Troy, the pyre of all courage and virtue,
she who even now has brought miserable death to our brother.
  Woe! my brother, taken from wretched me
Woe! delightful light withdrawn from my wretched brother,
  together with you our whole house is a tomb,
together with you our joys have been destroyed,
  which your sweet love nourished in your life.

So long now among unmarked graves
and not laid near his kindred's ashes,
but foul Troy, baleful Troy holds him,
buried alone in a far distant foreign land.
To which the young warriors of Greece were then borne in haste 
from every side, forsaking their household hearths,
to keep delighted Paris from passing his idle times
with his licentious abducted slut in a peaceful bedroom.
By this calamity then, beautiful Laudamia,
was your marriage, sweeter than life and soul, snatched away:
passion, devouring you so in a whirlpool of love,
had carried you into a broken chasm,
as the Greeks say that Pheneos near Cyllene 
dries out the soil from drained fertile swamp.
Because Amphitryon's pretended son is heard
to have once dug out the hewn marrows of the mountain,
when he struck down the Stymphalian monsters, 
shot with sure arrows by command of the lesser master,
so that the door of heaven might be worn out by more gods,
and Hebe would not stay long in maidenhood.
But you, who then taught the unbroken heifer to bear the yoke,
your deep love was deeper than that chasm.


nam nec tam carum confecto aetate parenti
una caput seri nata nepotis alit,
qui cum divitiis vix tandem iuventus avitis
nomen testatas intulit in tabulas,
impia derisi gentilis gaudia tollens,
suscitat a cano volturium capiti:
nec tantum niveo gavisa est ulla columbo
compar, quae multo dicitur improbius
oscula mordenti semper decerpere rostro,
quam quae praecipve multivola est mulier.
sed tu horum magnos vicisti sola furores,
ut semel es flavo conciliata viro.
aut nihil aut paulum cui tum concedere digna
lux mea se nostrum contulit in gremium,
quam circumcursans hinc illinc saepe Cupido
fulgebat crocina candidus in tunica.
quae tamen etsi uno non est contenta Catullo,
rara verecundae furta feremus erae
ne nimium simus stultorum more molesti.
saepe etiam Iuno, maxima caelicolum,
coniugis in culpa flagrantem concoquit iram,
noscens omnivoli plurima furta Iovis.
atqui nec divis homines componier aequum est


For neither so much the head of the tardy grandson,
beloved by his aged father (at the end of his life)
his only daughter nurses,
who, with his grandfather's wealth the youth at last only just
put his name onto his witnessed will,
robbing the derided former heir of his wicked joys,
shoos the vulture away from his gray head:

nor such with a snow-white pigeon did any woman rejoice
the like, who is said by many more wickedly
with a biting beak to always tear away kisses/mouths
than she is a woman most wantonly desirous:

But you alone (woman) conquered the great rages of these men,
as you are once united with a blond husband.

To whom it is either nothing or little to then withdraw, 
my worthy light has gathered itself into our lap,
how much running hither and yon, fair Cupid
often shone in a saffron-colored shirt.

Who, although she is not satisfied with Catullus alone,
the occasional thefts of the shy mistress,
lest we be annoyed by the custom of too many fools.

Besides Juno, greatest of the celestials,
often stomachs her burning rage at her guilty spouse,
when she learns of wanton Jove's many intrigues.

But men are not to be set as equal to the gods...
