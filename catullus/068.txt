LXVIII. ad Mallium 

Quod mihi fortuna casuque oppressus acerbo
     conscriptum hoc lacrimis mittis epistolium,
naufragum ut eiectum spumantibus aequoris undis
     sublevem et a mortis limine restituam,
quem neque sancta Venus molli requiescere somno
     desertum in lecto caelibe perpetitur,
nec veterum dulci scriptorum carmine Musae
     oblectant, cum mens anxia pervigilat:
id gratum est mihi, me quoniam tibi dicis amicum,
     muneraque et Musarum hinc petis et Veneris.
sed tibi ne mea sint ignota incommoda, Mani,
     neu me odisse putes hospitis officium,
accipe, quis merser fortunae fluctibus ipse,
     ne amplius a misero dona beata petas.
tempore quo primum vestis mihi tradita pura est,
     iucundum cum aetas florida ver ageret,
multa satis lusi: non est dea nescia nostri,
     quae dulcem curis miscet amaritiem.
sed totum hoc studium luctu fraterna mihi mors
     abstulit. o misero frater adempte mihi,
tu mea tu moriens fregisti commoda, frater,
     tecum una tota est nostra sepulta domus,
omnia tecum una perierunt gaudia nostra,
     quae tuus in vita dulcis alebat amor. 

LXVIII. to Mallius

what to gloomy/harsh me, overwhelmed by fortune and chance,
  this letter written down with tears you send,
>ship-wrecked/ruined in order that >cast off by the foamy waves of the sea 
  I might lift up and from death's threshold I might revive/restore,
whom neither Divine Venus with soft sleep to rest
  >forsaken in her bed by a single man endures,
nor >ancient to/by sweet poem of the muse of authors
  they delight while the uneasy mind keeps vigil:
it is pleasing to me, >/by me, because to yourself you say friend,
  and gifts of the muses from here you beg and of Venus.

but lest my ailments be unknown to you, Manius,
  or not >/by me to have hated you (might) think the kindness of the guest/host,
take/accept to/by whom I might drown myself in fortune's waves,
  lest more from a wretched man you beg with a happy gift.

by/to/in the time in which first clean clothing was delivered,
  >pleasant when a blooming age spends spring,
many things I mocked enough: it is not our unaware goddess,
  who stirs up a sweet bitterness.

but >all this zeal by brotherly grief to me death
  has snatched away.  O stolen brother by wretched to me,
you, dying, have broken my advantages, brother,
  with you our whole house is only ruined/interred,
all our joys with you only have died,
  which your love in sweet life was nourishing.
