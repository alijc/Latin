LXVIII. ad Mallium 

Quod mihi fortuna casuque oppressus acerbo
     conscriptum hoc lacrimis mittis epistolium,
naufragum ut eiectum spumantibus aequoris undis
     sublevem et a mortis limine restituam,
quem neque sancta Venus molli requiescere somno
     desertum in lecto caelibe perpetitur,
nec veterum dulci scriptorum carmine Musae
     oblectant, cum mens anxia pervigilat:
id gratum est mihi, me quoniam tibi dicis amicum,
     muneraque et Musarum hinc petis et Veneris.
sed tibi ne mea sint ignota incommoda, Mani,
     neu me odisse putes hospitis officium,
accipe, quis merser fortunae fluctibus ipse,
     ne amplius a misero dona beata petas.
tempore quo primum vestis mihi tradita pura est,
     iucundum cum aetas florida ver ageret,
multa satis lusi: non est dea nescia nostri,
     quae dulcem curis miscet amaritiem.
sed totum hoc studium luctu fraterna mihi mors
     abstulit. o misero frater adempte mihi,
tu mea tu moriens fregisti commoda, frater,
     tecum una tota est nostra sepulta domus,
omnia tecum una perierunt gaudia nostra,
     quae tuus in vita dulcis alebat amor. 

LXVIII. to Mallius

Why do you send this letter, composed with tears,
  to me, bitter and overwhelmed by fortune and mischance,
for me to lift up, shipwrecked and cast off by the foamy waves of the sea 
  and restore from death's threshold,
one whom Divine Venus does not allow to rest in a soft slumber
  forsaken in his celibate bed.
Nor do the muses delight with a sweet song of ancient scribes, 
  while the uneasy mind keeps vigil.
I am grateful/thankful, because you call me friend
  and ask favors of both Venus and the Muses.
But lest my misfortunes be unknown to you Manlius,
  or lest you think that I hate the duties of a host,
take, by those waves of fortune that I myself might drown in,
  lest you further beg happy gifts from a wretched man.
At the time when clean clothing (a man's toga?) was first handed to me,
  >pleasant, when a blooming age passed the spring,
I mocked many things well enough: it is not an unaware goddess [of us]
  who stirs up a sweet bitterness with/to cares.
But a brother's death has snatched all this zeal away to(!) me 
  with lamentation.  O brother, taken away from wretched me,
in dying, brother, you have dashed my gifts to bits,
  our whole house is entombed together with you,
all our joys have died together with you,
  which your love in sweet life was nourishing.
