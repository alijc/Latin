LXVIII. ad Manlium 

Quod mihi fortuna casuque oppressus acerbo
     conscriptum hoc lacrimis mittis epistolium,
naufragum ut eiectum spumantibus aequoris undis
     sublevem et a mortis limine restituam,
quem neque sancta Venus molli requiescere somno
     desertum in lecto caelibe perpetitur,
nec veterum dulci scriptorum carmine Musae
     oblectant, cum mens anxia pervigilat:
id gratum est mihi, me quoniam tibi dicis amicum,
     muneraque et Musarum hinc petis et Veneris.
sed tibi ne mea sint ignota incommoda, Mani,
     neu me odisse putes hospitis officium,
accipe, quis merser fortunae fluctibus ipse,
     ne amplius a misero dona beata petas.
tempore quo primum vestis mihi tradita pura est,
     iucundum cum aetas florida ver ageret,
multa satis lusi: non est dea nescia nostri,
     quae dulcem curis miscet amaritiem.
sed totum hoc studium luctu fraterna mihi mors
     abstulit. o misero frater adempte mihi,
tu mea tu moriens fregisti commoda, frater,
     tecum una tota est nostra sepulta domus,
omnia tecum una perierunt gaudia nostra,
     quae tuus in vita dulcis alebat amor. 
cuius ego interitu tota de mente fugavi
     haec studia atque omnes delicias animi.
quare, quod scribis Veronae turpe Catullo
     esse, quod hic quisquis de meliore nota
frigida deserto tepefactet membra cubili,
     id, Mani, non est turpe, magis miserum est.
ignosces igitur si, quae mihi luctus ademit,
     haec tibi non tribuo munera, cum nequeo.
nam, quod scriptorum non magna est copia apud me,
     hoc fit, quod Romae vivimus: illa domus,
illa mihi sedes, illic mea carpitur aetas;
     huc una ex multis capsula me sequitur.
quod cum ita sit, nolim statuas nos mente maligna
     id facere aut animo non satis ingenuo,
quod tibi non utriusque petenti copia posta est:
     ultro ego deferrem, copia siqua foret. [end of 68a]


LXVIII. to Manlius

Because you, overwhelmed by fortune and bitter mischance,
  send me this letter, composed in tears,
so that I might lift you up, wrecked and cast off by the foamy waves of the sea 
  and restore you from the threshold of death,
you whom Divine Venus does not allow to rest in a soft slumber,
  forsaken in your widower's bed.
Nor do the muses divert you with a sweet song of the ancient poets, 
  while your uneasy mind keeps vigil.
I am grateful that you call me friend
  and ask favors of both Venus and the Muses.
But so that my misfortunes not be unknown to you Manlius,
  and that you do not suppose that I hate the duties of a host,
hear, of those waves of fortune that I myself drown in,
  so that you'll no longer beg joyful gifts from a wretched man.
At the time when a man's toga was first handed to me,
  when a blooming age passed a pleasant spring,
I sported well enough: the goddess was not unknown to us
  who mixes a sweet bitterness with our cares.
But my brother's death has snatched all this zeal away from me 
  with lamentation.  O brother, taken away from wretched me,
in dying, brother, you have dashed my gifts to bits,
  our whole house is entombed together with you,
all our joys have died together with you,
  which your love nourished in your sweet life.
With his death I have completely routed from my mind
  these passions and all the pleasures of my soul.

And so, because you write that it's a shame for Catullus to be in Verona,
  because here someone of better note
would warm your freezing limbs in your lonely bed,
  that, Manlius, is not a shame, rather, it's a misfortune.
And so you'll excuse me if grief has taken from me
  these services that I do not bestow on you, as I cannot.
For, because there aren't a great many writings at my house,
  let this be, because we live in Rome: that house,
that home of mine, there my life is spent;
  only one of my many boxes of books has followed me here.
Since it is so, I'd not wish for you to think that we do 
  this with a spiteful mind or with a soul not noble enough,
because a sufficiency of either desire was not granted you:
  I'd bring off both, if there were enough.


Non possum reticere, deae, qua me Allius in re [start of 68 b]
     iuuerit aut quantis iuverit officiis,
ne fugiens saeclis obliviscentibus aetas
     illius hoc caeca nocte tegat studium:
sed dicam vobis, vos porro dicite multis
     milibus et facite haec carta loquatur anus.

I cannot conceal, godesses, how in this matter Allius
  did aid me, or with how many favors he did aid me,
lest the fleeing age, for forgotten generations, 
  should conceal his zeal in this unseeing night:
but I will tell you: speak in time to come to many
  thousands and make this old-maidenly letter give speech.
  

notescatque magis mortuus atque magis,
nec tenuem texens sublimis aranea telam
in deserto Alli nomine opus faciat.
nam, mihi quam dederit duplex Amathusia curam,
scitis, et in quo me torruerit genere,
cum tantum arderem quantum Trinacria rupes
lymphaque in Oetaeis Malia Thermopylis,
maesta neque assiduo tabescere lumina fletu
cessarent. tristique imbre madere genae.
qualis in aerii perlucens vertice montis
riuus muscoso prosilit e lapide,
qui cum de prona praeceps est valle volutus,
per medium densi transit iter populi,
dulce viatori lasso in sudore levamen,
cum gravis exustos aestus hiulcat agros:
hic, velut in nigro iactatis turbine nautis
lenius aspirans aura secunda venit
iam prece Pollucis, iam Castoris implorata,
tale fuit nobis Allius auxilium.
is clausum lato patefecit limite campum,
isque domum nobis isque dedit dominae,
ad quam communes exerceremus amores.

And let the dead become more and more known,
and let the work not make a fine airy web of spider's silk
in the departed name [in the desert, in name only], Allius.
For, Amathusia gave me what double care,
y'all know, and in which/where she bake[s/d] to bear me,
when so much I might blaze as much as the Trinacrian cliff
and the nymph Malia in Oetaeis Thermopylis,
sad(f) and not continually to dissolve the lights by weeping
they'd be remiss/leave off.  And to/by a sorrowful cheek/eye to be wet.
What sort in airy? shining through/translucent mountain peak
a stream out of mossy stone leaps up,
which (stone/man) when from headlong leaning forward valley is snaked,
through the middle of the solid/thick-planted poplar the road crosses,
sweet solace to a weary traveler in labor/sweat,
when a passion/fire splits open heavy burned up fields:
here/this, as if in black/dark whirlwind a sailor having been thrown
gentler/ly breathing a breath/breeze following comes
already the prayer of Pollux, already implored of Castor,
by such was to/by us Allius aid.
He with a broad path opened up the closed plain,
and he gave his lady's house to us,
to whom we cultivate impartial loves.
