LXVIII. ad Mallium 

Quod mihi fortuna casuque oppressus acerbo
     conscriptum hoc lacrimis mittis epistolium,
naufragum ut eiectum spumantibus aequoris undis
     sublevem et a mortis limine restituam,
quem neque sancta Venus molli requiescere somno
     desertum in lecto caelibe perpetitur,
nec veterum dulci scriptorum carmine Musae
     oblectant, cum mens anxia pervigilat:
id gratum est mihi, me quoniam tibi dicis amicum,
     muneraque et Musarum hinc petis et Veneris.
sed tibi ne mea sint ignota incommoda, Mani,
     neu me odisse putes hospitis officium,
accipe, quis merser fortunae fluctibus ipse,
     ne amplius a misero dona beata petas.
tempore quo primum vestis mihi tradita pura est,
     iucundum cum aetas florida ver ageret,
multa satis lusi: non est dea nescia nostri,
     quae dulcem curis miscet amaritiem.
sed totum hoc studium luctu fraterna mihi mors
     abstulit. o misero frater adempte mihi,
tu mea tu moriens fregisti commoda, frater,
     tecum una tota est nostra sepulta domus,
omnia tecum una perierunt gaudia nostra,
     quae tuus in vita dulcis alebat amor. 

LXVIII. to Mallius

Because you, overwhelmed by fortune and bitter mischance,
  send me this letter, composed in tears,
so that I might support you, wrecked and cast off by the foamy waves of the sea 
  and restore you from the threshold of death,
you whom Divine Venus does not allow to rest in a soft slumber
  forsaken in your widower's bed.
Nor do the muses divert you with a sweet song of the ancient poets, 
  while your uneasy mind keeps vigil.
I am grateful that you call me friend
  and ask favors of both Venus and the Muses.
But so that my misfortunes not be unknown to you Mallius,
  and that you do not suppose that I hate the duties of a host,
hear, of those waves of fortune that I myself drown in,
  so that you'll no longer beg joyful gifts from a wretched man.
At the time when a man's toga was first handed to me,
  when a blooming age passed a pleasant spring,
I mocked many things well enough: the goddess was not unknown to us
  who mixes a sweet bitterness with our cares.
But my brother's death has snatched all this zeal away from me 
  with lamentation.  O brother, taken away from wretched me,
in dying, brother, you have dashed my gifts to bits,
  our whole house is entombed together with you,
all our joys have died together with you,
  which your love nourished in your sweet life.
