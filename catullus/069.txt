LXIX. ad Rufum

Noli admirari, quare tibi femina nulla,
Rufe, velit tenerum supposuisse femur,
non si illam rarae labefactes munere vestis
aut perluciduli deliciis lapidis.
laedit te quaedam mala fabula, qua tibi fertur
ualle sub alarum trux habitare caper.
hunc metuunt omnes, neque mirum: nam mala valde est
bestia, nec quicum bella puella cubet.
quare aut crudelem nasorum interfice pestem,
aut admirari desine cur fugiunt.

LXIX. to Rufus

Leave off wondering why no woman,
Rufus, wants to put her tender thigh under you,
even though you move her with the gift of a fine robe
or with the delights of a crystal jewel.
A certain evil story harms you, which says that
a stink of wild goat lives in the hollow under your arms.
All men fear this, and no wonder: for it is verily an evil 
beast, and not one that a pretty lass would lie down with.
And so either destroy this cruel curse of noses,
or stop wondering why they run away.
