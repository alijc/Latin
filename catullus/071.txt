LXXI.

Si cui iure bono sacer alarum obstitit hircus,
aut si quem merito tarda podagra secat,
aemulus iste tuus, qui vestrem exercet amorem,
mirifice est a te nactus utrumque malum.
nam quotiens futuit, totiens ulciscitur ambos:
illam affligit odore, ipse perit podagra.

If the curse of armpit goat-smell justly thwarts any man,
or if limping gout deservedly torments anyone,
it's that measly rival of yours, the one who busies himself with your love,
who has, amazingly, gotten and both evils from you.
For each time that he fucks, he is avenged on both:
he prostrates her with his smell, while he's destroyed by gout.
