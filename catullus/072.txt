LXXII. ad Lesbiam

Dicebas quondam solum te nosse Catullum,
     Lesbia, nec prae me velle tenere Iovem.
dilexi tum te non tantum ut vulgus amicam,
     sed pater ut gnatos diligit et generos.
nunc te cognovi: quare etsi impensius uror,
     multo mi tamen es vilior et levior.
qui potis est, inquis? quod amantem iniuria talis
     cogit amare magis, sed bene velle minus.

LXXII. to Lesbia

You used to say that you 'knew' only Catullus,
    Lesbia, and wouldn't prefer to embrace Jupiter over me.
I esteemed you then, not as the average man loves his girlfriend,
    but as a father loves his sons and sons-in-law.
Now I know you: and so I am scorched all the more,
    and yet to me you are more trifling and fickle by far.
Who could do this? you say. Because such an offense 
    compels a lover to love you more, but respect you less.
