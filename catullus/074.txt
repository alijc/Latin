74. ad Gellium 

Gellius audierat patruum obiurgare solere,
si quis delicias diceret aut faceret.
hoc ne ipsi accideret, patrui perdepsuit ipsam
uxorem, et patruum reddidit Arpocratem.
quod voluit fecit: nam, quamvis irrumet ipsum
nunc patruum, verbum non faciet patruus.  

To Gellius

Gellius had heard that his uncle was wont to scold,
if anyone >pets he might say or do.
This lest to himself it might happen, of uncle it dishonors/f@cks 
wife herself, and >uncle returns >Arpocrate.
What/Because wished made: for, however much might screw/bugger >himself
now >uncle, uncle won't make a word.
