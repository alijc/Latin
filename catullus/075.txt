75. ad Lesbiam 

Huc est mens deducta tua, mea Lesbia, culpa
atque ita se officio perdidit ipsa suo,
ut iam nec bene velle queat tibi, si optima fias,
nec desistere amare, omnia si facias.  

To Lesbia

My mind is drawn here, my Lesbia, by your fault
and has so lost itself in its service to you,
that now it could not wish you well, if you were perfect,
nor cease to love you, whatever you do.
