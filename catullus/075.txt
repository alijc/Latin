75. ad Lesbiam 

Huc est mens deducta tua mea, Lesbia, culpa
atque ita se officio perdidit ipsa suo,
ut iam nec bene velle queat tibi, si optima fias,
nec desistere amare, omnia si facias.  

To Lesbia

Here is your mind drawn, Lesbia, by my fault
and so by her duty/kindness she destroyed herself,
so that already and not well to wish she can to you, if you were good,
and not to cease to love, if you were to do everything.
