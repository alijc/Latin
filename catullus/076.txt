LXXVI. ad deos 

Si qua recordanti benefacta priora voluptas
est homini, cum se cogitat esse pium,
nec sanctam violasse fidem, nec foedere nullo
divum ad fallendos numine abusum homines,
multa parata manent in longa aetate, Catulle,
ex hoc ingrato gaudia amore tibi.
nam quaecumque homines bene cuiquam aut dicere possunt
aut facere, haec a te dictaque factaque sunt.
omnia quae ingratae perierunt credita menti.
quare iam te cur amplius excrucies?
quin tu animo offirmas atque istinc teque reducis,
et dis invitis desinis esse miser? 

LXXVI. to the gods

If any pleasure comes to a man in remembering good deeds 
done in the past, as he considers himself conscientious,
and hasn't dishonored the sacred trust, nor, spent,
defiles any pact of the gods to trip men up,
then many ready joys endure for you life-long, Catullus,
from this thankless love of yours.
For whatever men can well say or do for any man, 
these things have been said and done by you.
All these perish, when entrusted to an ungrateful mind.
Why then do you torment yourself even more?
Why don't you firm up your soul and draw back from there,
and give over being wretched, since the gods are unwilling.
