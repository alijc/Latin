LXXVI. ad deos 

Si qua recordanti benefacta priora voluptas
est homini, cum se cogitat esse pium,
nec sanctam violasse fidem, nec foedere nullo
divum ad fallendos numine abusum homines,
multa parata manent in longa aetate, Catulle,
ex hoc ingrato gaudia amore tibi.
nam quaecumque homines bene cuiquam aut dicere possunt
aut facere, haec a te dictaque factaque sunt.
omnia quae ingratae perierunt credita menti.
quare iam te cur amplius excrucies?
quin tu animo offirmas atque istinc teque reducis,
et dis invitis desinis esse miser? 

LXXVI. to the gods

If any former well-served pleasure comes
to a mindful man, while he thinks that he's devout,
and doesn't dishonor the sacred trust, or defile in any way
the exhausted god for deceiving men with divine will,
may many ready joys abide for ages long, Catullus,
from this thankless deed with love to you.

For whichever women can either speak or do well to anyone, 
these things are both spoken and done by you.

All these trusted things pass away to an ungrateful mind.

How, why should you still torment yourself more?

Why do you not persevere with your soul and from there and restore yourself,
and cease being wretched to/by the unwilling gods.
