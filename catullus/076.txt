LXXVI. ad deos 

Si qua recordanti benefacta priora voluptas
est homini, cum se cogitat esse pium,
nec sanctam violasse fidem, nec foedere nullo
divum ad fallendos numine abusum homines,
multa parata manent in longa aetate, Catulle,
ex hoc ingrato gaudia amore tibi.
nam quaecumque homines bene cuiquam aut dicere possunt
aut facere, haec a te dictaque factaque sunt.
omnia quae ingratae perierunt credita menti.
quare iam te cur amplius excrucies?
quin tu animo offirmas atque istinc teque reducis,
et dis invitis desinis esse miser? 

LXXVI. to the gods

If any pleasure comes to a man in remembering good deeds 
done in the past, as he considers himself conscientious,
and hasn't dishonored the sacred trust, nor, spent,
defiles any pact of the gods to trip men up,
then many ready joys endure for you life-long, Catullus,
from this thankless love of yours.
For whatever men can well say or do for any man, 
these things have been said and done by you.
All these perish, when entrusted to an ungrateful mind.
Why then do you torment yourself even more?
Why don't you firm up your soul and draw back from there,
and give over being wretched, since the gods are unwilling.

difficile est longum subito deponere amorem,
difficile est, verum hoc qua lubet efficias:
una salus haec est. hoc est tibi pervincendum,
hoc facias, sive id non pote sive pote.
o di, si vestrum est misereri, aut si quibus umquam
extremam iam ipsa in morte tulistis opem,
me miserum aspicite et, si vitam puriter egi,
eripite hanc pestem perniciemque mihi,
quae mihi subrepens imos ut torpor in artus
expulit ex omni pectore laetitias.
non iam [illud] quaero, contra me ut diligat illa,
aut, quod non potis est, esse pudica velit:
ipse valere opto et taetrum hunc deponere morbum,
o di, reddite mi hoc pro pietate mea.  

It's hard to put aside a long-held love abruptly,
It's hard, however you work out this truth.
There is this saving grace only, it is for you to be achieved -
may you do this, whether or not it can be done.

Gods! if it is in you to be pitied, or if ever by/to which ones
now in her you have brought final aid in death,
gaze on my wretched self and, if I have led my life properly,
take this pestilence and plague away from me,
as the torpor creeping into my inmost joints 
has completely driven joy out of my breast.

No longer do I seek that, for her to love me in return,
or, because it cannot be, for her to be minded to be chaste:
I myself choose to be strong and to put aside this foul disease,
Gods! restore this to me for my piety.
