LXXVI. ad deos 

Si qua recordanti benefacta priora voluptas
est homini, cum se cogitat esse pium,
nec sanctam violasse fidem, nec foedere nullo
divum ad fallendos numine abusum homines,
multa parata manent in longa aetate, Catulle,
ex hoc ingrato gaudia amore tibi.
nam quaecumque homines bene cuiquam aut dicere possunt
aut facere, haec a te dictaque factaque sunt.
omnia quae ingratae perierunt credita menti.
quare iam te cur amplius excrucies?
quin tu animo offirmas atque istinc teque reducis,
et dis invitis desinis esse miser? 

LXXVI. to the gods

If by which remembering benefitted earlier pleasure
is to man, with self he thinks to be pius/faithful,
and not to dishonor holy faith, nor to defile to no one
a god about to deceive by/to divinity >abuse men,
many prepared things might pour in a long age, Catullus,
out of this ungrateful thing joy by love to you.
For whichever things >men well to anyone either can say
or do, these things by you are both said and done.
All things which of an ungrateful mind they pass away trusted.
Why should you still torment yourself more why?
Why do you not secure with your soul and from there and restore yourself,
and abandon to/by the reluctant gods to be wretched.
