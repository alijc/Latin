LXXIX. ad Lesbium

Lesbius est pulcer. quid ni? quem Lesbia malit
     quam te cum tota gente, Catulle, tua.
sed tamen hic pulcer vendat cum gente Catullum,
     si tria natorum suavia reppererit.

to Lesbius

Lesbius is handsome, of course, and Lesbia prefers him
     over you and all your people, Catullus.
But all the same this handsome man would sell Catullus along with his people,
     if he could obtain the kisses of three acquaintances.
