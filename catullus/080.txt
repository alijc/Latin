LXXX. ad Gellium 

Quid dicam, Gelli, quare rosea ista labella
hiberna fiant candidiora nive,
mane domo cum exis et cum te octava quiete
e molli longo suscitat hora die?
nescio quid certe est: an vere fama susurrat
grandia te medii tenta vorare viri?
sic certe est: clamant Victoris rupta miselli
ilia, et emulso labra notata sero.

What could I say, Gellius, how those rosy lips of yours 
would be made more radiant by wintery snow,
as you leave home in the morning and as the hour
wakes you from your afternoon nap, late in the gentle day?
I certainly don't know what: or does full-grown rumor really whisper
that you swallow stretched/held things in the middle of a man?
This much is sure: poor Victor's torn guts cry out,
and lips observed drained late in the day.
