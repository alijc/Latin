LXXX. ad Gellium 

Quid dicam, Gelli, quare rosea ista labella
hiberna fiant candidiora nive,
mane domo cum exis et cum te octava quiete
e molli longo suscitat hora die?
nescio quid certe est: an vere fama susurrat
grandia te medii tenta vorare viri?
sic certe est: clamant Victoris rupta miselli
ilia, et emulso labra notata sero.

LXXX. to Gellius

I'd like to ask you, Gellius, what makes those rosy lips of yours 
brighter than the winter's snow,
when you leave home in the morning and when the hour
wakes you from your gentle afternoon nap, late in the day?
I surely don't know what it is: or does the rumor rightly whisper
that you swallow what's long and full in the middle of a man?
This much is sure: it's proclaimed by poor Victor's bursted manly parts,
and your lips marked with what was drained, late in the day.
