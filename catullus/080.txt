LXXX. ad Gellium 

Quid dicam, Gelli, quare rosea ista labella
hiberna fiant candidiora nive,
mane domo cum exis et cum te octava quiete
e molli longo suscitat hora die?
nescio quid certe est: an vere fama susurrat
grandia te medii tenta vorare viri?
sic certe est: clamant Victoris rupta miselli
ilia, et emulso labra notata sero.

what will I say, Gellius, how would those rosy lips of yours 
be made more radiant by wintery snow,
early in the morning as you go out of your house and with you with the 8th rest
out of soft tedious day the hour awakens?
I don't know what is certain: or realy fame/rumor buzzes
old/grand stretched/kept (rumor) you of the middle of men to swallow?
This much is sure: they cry of Victor broken guts of a wretched man,
and ??? bowls/lips observed late in the day.
