LXXXII. ad Qvintium

Quinti, si tibi vis oculos debere Catullum
     aut aliud si quid carius est oculis,
eripere ei noli, multo quod carius illi
     est oculis seu quid carius est oculis.

LXXXII. to Quintius

Quintius, if you want Catullus to owe his eyes to you
  or something else if anything is more dear than eyes,
refuse to take away from him, what is much dearer to him
  than his eyes if anything is dearer than eyes.
