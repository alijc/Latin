LXXXIII. ad Lesbiam

Lesbia mi praesente viro mala plurima dicit:
haec illi fatuo maxima laetitia est.
mule, nihil sentis? si nostri oblita taceret,
sana esset: nunc quod gannit et obloquitur,
non solum meminit, sed, quae multo acrior est res,
irata est. hoc est, uritur et loquitur.

LXXXIII. to Lesbia

Lesbia, for me the present circumstance to/by man says the most evil things:
these to that fool(ish) is the greatest joy.
You mule, do you feel nothing?  If having forgotten/forgetful of us she would be
silent,
she'd be sane/well: now because/what she whimpers/snarls and interrupts,
not only she remembered/heeded, but, who/which much bitterer is the thing,
she flew into a rage.  This is, she is burned and speaks.
