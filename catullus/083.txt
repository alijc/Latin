LXXXIII. ad Lesbiam

Lesbia mi praesente viro mala plurima dicit:
haec illi fatuo maxima laetitia est.
mule, nihil sentis? si nostri oblita taceret,
sana esset: nunc quod gannit et obloquitur,
non solum meminit, sed, quae multo acrior est res,
irata est. hoc est, uritur et loquitur.

LXXXIII. to Lesbia

Lesbia speaks evil of me to her husband's face:
she is the greatest joy to that fool.
You ass, don't you notice anything?  If she forgot us and kept quiet,
she'd be OK: now because she snarls and rails,
not only did she remember, but, what's even worse,
she flew into a rage.  That is, she's scorched and therefore speaks.
