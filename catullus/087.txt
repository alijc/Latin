LXXXVII. ad Lesbiam

Nulla potest mulier tantum se dicere amatam
     vere, quantum a me Lesbia amata mea est.
nulla fides ullo fuit umquam foedere tanta,
     quanta in amore tuo ex parte reperta mea est.

LXXXVII. to Lesbia

No woman can so much call herself beloved
   in truth, as much by me Lesbia is my beloved.
No faithfulness by any man was ever to be defiled? so,
   how great in love to move away out of your part is my discovery.
