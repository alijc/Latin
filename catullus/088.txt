LXXXVIII. ad Gellium

Quid facit is, Gelli, qui cum matre atque sorore
     prurit, et abiectis pervigilat tunicis?
quid facit is, patruum qui non sinit esse maritum?
     ecquid scis quantum suscipiat sceleris?
suscipit, o Gelli, quantum non ultima Tethys
     nec genitor Nympharum abluit Oceanus:
nam nihil est quicquam sceleris, quo prodeat ultra,
     non si demisso se ipse voret capite.

LXXXVIII, to Gellius

what does he do, Gellius, who is aroused by his mother and sister,
   and stays awake all night with his underclothes thrown off?
what does he do, who doesn't allow his uncle to be married?
   do you know at all how much wickedness he undertakes/receives?
he undertakes/receives, Gellius, not as far as to Tethys' furthest bounds
   and neither does Ocean, the father of the Nymphs, wash it away:
for nothing is anything of the wickedness by which he goes beyond,
   not even if he were to swallow himself with his lowered head.
