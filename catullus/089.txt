LXXXIX. ad Gellium

Gellius est tenuis: quid ni? cui tam bona mater
     tamque valens vivat tamque venusta soror
tamque bonus patruus tamque omnia plena puellis
     cognatis, quare is desinat esse macer?
qui ut nihil attingat, nisi quod fas tangere non est,
     quantumvis quare sit macer invenies.

to Gellius

Gellius is thin: why not? to him such a good mother
  and he might live so well and such an attractive sister
and such a good uncle and such all things filled with little
  relations, why he ceases to be scrawny?
who in order to touch nothing, unless because it is not divine law to touch,
  although you will find why he is scrawny.
