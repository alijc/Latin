LXXXIX. ad Gellium

Gellius est tenuis: quid ni? cui tam bona mater
     tamque valens vivat tamque venusta soror
tamque bonus patruus tamque omnia plena puellis
     cognatis, quare is desinat esse macer?
qui ut nihil attingat, nisi quod fas tangere non est,
     quantumvis quare sit macer invenies.

to Gellius

Gellius is thin: And why not? He has such an obliging mother
  and lives so well, and such an attractive sister
and such an obliging uncle and all such things filled with young
  relations, why he should he stop being scrawny?
Who, to touch nothing, unless it is taboo to touch,
  you'll find ever so much why he is scrawny.
