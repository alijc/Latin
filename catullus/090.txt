XC. ad Gellium

Nascatur magus ex Gelli matrisque nefando
     coniugio et discat Persicum aruspicium:
nam magus ex matre et gnato gignatur oportet,
     si vera est Persarum impia religio,
gratus ut accepto veneretur carmine divos
     omentum in flamma pingue liquefaciens.

Let a magician be born from the wicked wedlock of Gellius
   and his mother, and let him learn the divination of the Persians:
for it is meet for a magician to be born of of a mother and son,
   if the Persians' wicked religion is true,
to pleasingly worship the gods with an acceptable song 
   while the fat in the flame melts into grease.
