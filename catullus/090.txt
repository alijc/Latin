XC. ad Gellium

Nascatur magus ex Gelli matrisque nefando
     coniugio et discat Persicum aruspicium:
nam magus ex matre et gnato gignatur oportet,
     si vera est Persarum impia religio,
gratus ut accepto veneretur carmine divos
     omentum in flamma pingue liquefaciens.

Let a wise man/magician be born out of Gellius and his mother's wicked
   wedlock and let he learn the Persian of soothsayers:
for a magician out of mother and son let be born it is meet,
   if true is of the Persians' wicked religion,
he is pleasing in order to worship the gods with a pleasing song 
   the fat in the flame melting into grease.
