XCI. ad Gellium

Non ideo, Gelli, sperabam te mihi fidum
in misero hoc nostro, hoc perdito amore fore,
quod te cognossem bene constantemve putarem
aut posse a turpi mentem inhibere probro;
sed neque quod matrem nec germanam esse videbam
hanc tibi, cuius me magnus edebat amor.
et quamvis tecum multo coniungerer usu,
non satis id causae credideram esse tibi.
tu satis id duxti: tantum tibi gaudium in omni
culpa est, in quacumque est aliquid sceleris.

XCI. to Gellius

For no reason, Gellius, did I hope that you would be true to me
in this my pitiable, this my squandered love,
because I had understood you well or thought you constant
or able to restrain your soul from foul disgrace;
but because I saw one who was neither your mother nor your sister,
one whose great love was consuming me.
And however much I might have been yoked with you by much enjoyment,
I hadn't believed that this would be cause enough for you.
you did it well enough: for you there is so much joy in every
fault in which there's any sin.
