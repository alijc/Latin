XCI. ad Gellium

Non ideo, Gelli, sperabam te mihi fidum
in misero hoc nostro, hoc perdito amore fore,
quod te cognossem bene constantemve putarem
aut posse a turpi mentem inhibere probro;
sed neque quod matrem nec germanam esse videbam
hanc tibi, cuius me magnus edebat amor.
et quamvis tecum multo coniungerer usu,
non satis id causae credideram esse tibi.
tu satis id duxti: tantum tibi gaudium in omni
culpa est, in quacumque est aliquid sceleris.

XCI. to Gellius

not for that reason, Gellius, I hoped you to me loyal
in this my wretched, this ruined/lost love to be going to be,
that/because/what you I had learned well or thought constant
or to be able to from shame >mind to restrain by disgrace;
but neither that/because/what >mother nor sister to be I saw
>this to you, whose great love was consuming me.
And >whomever with you by much use/experience I was shagged/united,
you have led it enough: so much to you joy in everything
is a fault, in whichever way is anything a sin.
