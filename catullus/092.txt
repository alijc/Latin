XCII. ad Lesbia

Lesbia mi dicit semper male nec tacet umquam
     de me: Lesbia me dispeream nisi amat.
quo signo? quia sunt totidem mea: deprecor illam
     assidue, verum dispeream nisi amo.


XCII. to Lesbia

Lesbia always speaks ill of me and never shuts up about me:
   I'd be lost if Lesbia didn't love me.
Where's the proof?  For it's just the same with me: I exsecrate her
   all the time, I'd be truly lost if I didn't love her.
