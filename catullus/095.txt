XCV. ad Gaium Helvium Cinnam

Zmyrna mei Cinnae nonam post denique messem
     quam coepta est nonamque edita post hiemem,
milia cum interea quingenta Hortensius uno
     * * * * * * * * 
Zmyrna cavas Satrachi penitus mittetur ad undas,
     Zmyrnam cana diu saecula pervoluent.
at Volusi annales Paduam morientur ad ipsam
     et laxas scombris saepe dabunt tunicas.

XCVb.

Parva mei mihi sint cordi monimenta ...,
     at populus tumido gaudeat Antimacho.


XCV. to Gaius Helvius Cinna

My Cinna's Smyrna in the end after the ninth harvest
   that was begun and after the ninth winter was rising,
meanwhile Hortensius, with a thousand five hundred and one...
   ******

Smyrna >hollows Satrachi deep inside was sent to the waves,
  >Smyrna white ages by day ???.
But the Volusi annals >Padua will die to it
   and they often give loose tunics to mackerels.

XCVb.

Let my heart's small monument be my own...,
   but let the people rejoice for Antimachus.
