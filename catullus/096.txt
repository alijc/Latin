XCVI. ad Gaium Licinium Calvum

Si quicquam mutis gratum acceptumque sepulcris
     accidere a nostro, Calve, dolore potest,
quo desiderio veteres renovamus amores
     atque olim missas flemus amicitias,
certe non tanto mors immatura dolori est
     Qvintiliae, quantum gaudet amore tuo.


XCVI. to Gaius Licinius Calvus

If anything pleasing and welcome can happen
   to the silent tombs by means of our sorrow, Calvus,
by which desire we revive the ancient loves
   and we once weep/might have breathed dismissed friendships,
surely not as much untimely death  in grief is
   of Quintilia, as it rejoices in your love.
