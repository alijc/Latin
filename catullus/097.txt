XCVII. ad Aemilium

Non (ita me di ament) quicquam referre putavi,
     utrumne os an culum olfacerem Aemilio.
nilo mundius hoc, nihiloque immundius illud,
     verum etiam culus mundior et melior:
nam sine dentibus est. hic dentis sesquipedalis,
     gingivas vero ploxeni habet veteris,
praeterea rictum qualem diffissus in aestu
     meientis mulae cunnus habere solet.
hic futuit multas et se facit esse venustum,
     et non pistrino traditur atque asino?
quem siqua attingit, non illam posse putemus
     aegroti culum lingere carnificis?

XCVII. to Aemilius

I did not (may the gods so love me) think to report anything,
   whether I smelled the mouth or the butt with Aemilius.
The first is fouler than nothing, and the second cleaner,
   in truth the butt is cleaner and more healthy:
for it has no teeth.  He has ancient teeth,
   a foot and a half long, and gums indeed of bodywork,
besides a pissing she-mule's girl bits, split/put off in passion,
   are wont to have that sort of gaping mouth 
He has had sex with many women and makes himself seem charming,
  and is not handed over to the ass's workhouse?
whom if by any woman it touches, we wouldn't think that she could
  lick a sick scoundrel' butt?
