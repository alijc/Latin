XCVII. ad Aemilium

Non (ita me di ament) quicquam referre putavi,
     utrumne os an culum olfacerem Aemilio.
nilo mundius hoc, nihiloque immundius illud,
     verum etiam culus mundior et melior:
nam sine dentibus est. hic dentis sesquipedalis,
     gingivas vero ploxeni habet veteris,
praeterea rictum qualem diffissus in aestu
     meientis mulae cunnus habere solet.
hic futuit multas et se facit esse venustum,
     et non pistrino traditur atque asino?
quem siqua attingit, non illam posse putemus
     aegroti culum lingere carnificis?

XCVII. to Aemilius

I did not (may the gods so love me) think to report anything,
   whether it was Aemilius' mouth or his butt that I smelled.
The first is fouler than anything, and the second cleaner,
   in truth the butt is cleaner and better:
for it has no teeth.  He has ancient teeth,
   a foot and a half long, and gums truly like a wagonbox,
moreover a pissing she-mule's vulva, open in her heat,
   is wont to have that sort of gaping mouth 
Has he had sex with many women and makes himself seem charming,
  and is not handed over to the ass's workhouse?
whom if by any woman it touches, wouldn't we think that she could
  lick a sick scoundrel' butt?
