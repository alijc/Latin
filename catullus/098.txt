XCVIII. ad Victium

In te, si in quemquam, dici pote, putide Victi,
     id quod verbosis dicitur et fatuis.
ista cum lingua, si usus veniat tibi, possis
     culos et crepidas lingere carpatinas.
si nos omnino vis omnes perdere, Victi,
     hiscas: omnino quod cupis efficies.


XCVIII. to Victius

Stinky Victius, what is said by windy and silly men
  can be said about you, if it can be said about anyone.
With that tongue of yours, if the habit came to you, you could
  lick butts and sandals made of leather.
If you wish us all to be utterly destroyed, Victius,
  just open your mouth: you'll totally have your wish.
