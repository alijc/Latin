XCVIII. ad Victium

In te, si in quemquam, dici pote, putide Victi,
     id quod verbosis dicitur et fatuis.
ista cum lingua, si usus veniat tibi, possis
     culos et crepidas lingere carpatinas.
si nos omnino vis omnes perdere, Victi,
     hiscas: omnino quod cupis efficies.


XCVIII. to Victus

about/to you, if about/to anyone, it can be said, stinking Victus,
  that it to/by verbose and foolish men it is said.
that tongue of yours, if the use might come to you, you'd be able
  to lick butts and sandals made of leather.
if we entirely all power to be lost, Victus,
  you open your mouth: you entirely accomplish what you want.
