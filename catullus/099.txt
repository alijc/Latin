XCIX. ad Iuventium

Surripui tibi, dum ludis, mellite Iuventi,
     suaviolum dulci dulcius ambrosia.
verum id non impune tuli: namque amplius horam
     suffixum in summa me memini esse cruce,
dum tibi me purgo nec possum fletibus ullis
     tantillum vestrae demere saevitiae.
nam simul id factum est, multis diluta labella
     guttis abstersisti omnibus articulis,
ne quicquam nostro contractum ex ore maneret,
     tamquam commictae spurca saliva lupae.
praeterea infesto miserum me tradere amori
     non cessasti omnique excruciare modo,
ut mi ex ambrosia mutatum iam foret illud
     suaviolum tristi tristius elleboro.
quam quoniam poenam misero proponis amori,
     numquam iam posthac basia surripiam.


XCIX. to Juventius

I stole from you, sweet Juventius, while you played,
  a tender kiss, sweeter than ambrosia, from my sweetie.
In truth I didn't get it scot free: for I'm sure I spent
  more than an hour hanging on the tallest cross,
until I purge(d) myself of you and I can't
  snip the least bit of your rage away with any tears.
For as soon as the deed was done, with/from many jugs/drops/specks
  you have wiped off your washed/moistened lips with all your fingers,
lest anything dishonorable from my mouth remain,
  like the filthy spittle of a foul whore.
Besides you never stopped betraying my wretched self to hostile love
  and tormenting me in every way,
so that out of/from ambrosia >altered already/now 
  that tender kiss is to sad me sadder than hellebore.
Because which punishment to wretched love you display,
  no longer will I ever steal kisses after this.
