XCIX. ad Iuventium

Surripui tibi, dum ludis, mellite Iuventi,
     suaviolum dulci dulcius ambrosia.
verum id non impune tuli: namque amplius horam
     suffixum in summa me memini esse cruce,
dum tibi me purgo nec possum fletibus ullis
     tantillum vestrae demere saevitiae.
nam simul id factum est, multis diluta labella
     guttis abstersisti omnibus articulis,
ne quicquam nostro contractum ex ore maneret,
     tamquam commictae spurca saliva lupae.
praeterea infesto miserum me tradere amori
     non cessasti omnique excruciare modo,
ut mi ex ambrosia mutatum iam foret illud
     suaviolum tristi tristius elleboro.
quam quoniam poenam misero proponis amori,
     numquam iam posthac basia surripiam.


XCIX. to Juventius

I stole from you, sweet Juventius, while you played,
  a tender kiss, sweeter than sweet ambrosia.
In truth I didn't get it scot free: for I thought that I spent
  more than an hour hanging from the tallest cross,
until I excused myself to you.  Nor could I 
  snip the least bit of your rage away with any tears.
For as soon as the deed was done, with/from many drops
  you wiped your drenched lips with all your fingers,
lest any wrinkling thing from my mouth remain,
  like the filthy spittle of a foul whore.
Besides you never stopped betraying my wretched self to injurious Love
  and tormenting me in every way,
so that you'd be for me that other tender kiss
  from ambrosia now more bitter than bitter hellebore.
Because you set such a penalty for your wretched love,
  henceforth I'll never steal another kiss again.
