C. ad Marcum Caelium furum

Caelius Aufillenum et Qvintius Aufillenam
     flos Veronensum depereunt iuvenum,
hic fratrem, ille sororem. hoc est, quod dicitur, illud
     fraternum vere dulce sodalicium.
cui faveam potius? Caeli, tibi: nam tua nobis
     perspecta ex igni est unica amicitia,
cum vesana meas torreret flamma medullas.
     sis felix, Caeli, sis in amore potens.

C. to the thief Marcus Caelius

Caelius and Qvintius love the Aufilleni,
    the flower of the youth of Verona, to distraction
this one the brother, and that the sister.  This is, what is said, 
     indeed that delightful brotherly fellowship.
Whom should I favor more?  You, Caelius: for your uncommon friendship
    towards us was observed out of passion,
since a frenzied flame roasts my inmost parts.
    May you be happy, Caelius, may you be strong in love.
