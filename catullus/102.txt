CII. ad Cornelium Nepotem

Si quicquam tacito commissum est fido ab amico,
     cuius sit penitus nota fides animi,
meque esse invenies illorum iure sacratum,
     Corneli, et factum me esse puta Arpocratem.

To Cornelius

If anything was quietly entrusted by a faithful friend,
  whose inmost loyalty of soul is known,
you will find that I too am one of those bound by law,
  Cornelius, and think you that I have become the god of silence.
