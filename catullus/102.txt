CII. ad Cornelium Nepotem

Si quicquam tacito commissum est fido ab amico,
     cuius sit penitus nota fides animi,
meque esse invenies illorum iure sacratum,
     Corneli, et factum me esse puta Arpocratem.

To the prodigal?/playboy Cornelius

If anything was entrusted by a secret faithful friend,
  whose might be inner/inside familiar/known loyalty of soul/mind,
and you will find that I am of those by law sacred,
  Cornelius, and you must think that I have become Arpocrata.
