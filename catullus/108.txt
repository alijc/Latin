FRATER AVE, ATQUE VALE.

MultAs per gentEs et multa per aequora vectus
 adveniO hAs miserAs, frAter, ad InferiAs,
ut tE postrEmO dOnArem mUnere mortis
 et mUtam nEquIquam adloquerer cinerem,
quandoquidem fortUna mihI tEtE abstulit ipsum,
 heu miser indignE frAter adempte mihI.
Nunc tamen intereA haec, prIscO quae mOre parentum
 Tradita sunt trIstI mUnere ad InferiAs,
 Accipe in perpetuum, frAter, avE atque vAle.

Greetings, brother, and farewell

Borne through many nations and over many seas,
 I come, brother,  to these wretched offerings to the dead,
so that I might present you with the gifts of death 
 and address your silent ashes in vain,
since fortune has stolen you yourself from me,
 alas, poor brother unjustly carried away from me.
Now however meanwhile these, that to/by our parents' former habit/custom 
 were handed over to/by sad gift to dead offerings,
Accept forever, brother, greetings and farewell.
