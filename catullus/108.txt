CVIII. ad Cominium

Si, Comini, populi arbitrio tua cana senectus
spurcata impuris moribus intereat,
non equidem dubito quin primum inimica bonorum
lingua exsecta avido sit data vulturio,
effossos oculos voret atro gutture coruus,
intestina canes, cetera membra lupi.

to Cominius

If, Cominius, your gray old age, soiled with foul habits,
had perished by the judgement of the people,
indeed I have no doubt that (the chief of good things)
your harmful tongue would have been cut out and given to a greedy vulture,
that a raven with a grisly gullet would swallow your gouged out eyes,
dogs your guts, and wolves your other organs.
