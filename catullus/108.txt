CVIII. ad Cominium

Si, Comini, populi arbitrio tua cana senectus
spurcata impuris moribus intereat,
non equidem dubito quin primum inimica bonorum
lingua exsecta avido sit data vulturio,
effossos oculos voret atro gutture coruus,
intestina canes, cetera membra lupi.

to Cominius

If, Cominius, your gray old age, soiled with foul habits,
were ever done in by the judgement of the people,
indeed I have no doubt that first your tongue, harmful to good men,
would be cut out and given to a greedy vulture,
that a raven would swallow your gouged out eyes down his grisly gullet,
dogs your guts, and wolves your other organs.
