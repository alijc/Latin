CX. ad Aufilenam

Aufilena, bonae semper laudantur amicae:
     accipiunt pretium, quae facere instituunt.
tu, quod promisti, mihi quod mentita inimica es,
     quod nec das et fers saepe, facis facinus.
aut facere ingenuae est, aut non promisse pudicae,
     Aufillena, fuit: sed data corripere
fraudando officiis, plus quam meretricis avarae
     quae sese toto corpore prostituit.

To Aufillena

Aufillena, good courtesans are always praised:
  they get their price for what they undertake to do.
You, because you made promises to me that you broke, are nasty,
  because you don't give out and often run off with the fee, you commit a crime.
An honest woman would do the deed, while a chaste one wouldn't have promised it,
  Aufillena: but to steal what was given
by cheating makes you more than a greedy harlot
  who prostitutes herself with her whole body.
