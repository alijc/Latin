CX. ad Aufilenam

Aufilena, bonae semper laudantur amicae:
     accipiunt pretium, quae facere instituunt.
tu, quod promisti, mihi quod mentita inimica es,
     quod nec das et fers saepe, facis facinus.
aut facere ingenuae est, aut non promisse pudicae,
     Aufillena, fuit: sed data corripere
fraudando officiis, plus quam meretricis avarae
     quae sese toto corpore prostituit.

To Aufillena

Aufillena, obliging girlfriends are always praised:
  they get their price, whatever they set.
You, because you made promises to me that you broke, are my enemy,
  because you often avow and don't give out, you commit an outrage.
An honest woman would do the deed, while a chaste one wouldn't have promised it,
  Aufillena: but to take what was given
by cheating one's duties, more than a greedy harlot's
  who prostitutes herself with her whole body.
