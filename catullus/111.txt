CXI. ad Aufilenam

Aufilena, viro contentam vivere solo,
     nuptarum laus ex laudibus eximiis:
sed cuivis quamvis potius succumbere par est,
     quam matrem fratres efficere ex patruoâ€¦


to Aufilena

Aufilena, to live contented with a single man,
    is the best grounds for praise for brides:
but it's better to lie under any man in the world,
    than for a mother to make cousins from her uncle...
