CXI. ad Aufilenam

Aufilena, viro contentam vivere solo,
     nuptarum laus ex laudibus eximiis:
sed cuivis quamvis potius succumbere par est,
     quam matrem fratres efficere ex patruoâ€¦


to Aufilena

Aufilena, to live restrained by a single man,
    is the best grounds for praise for brides:
but it's better for a spouse to yield to any man at all,
    than for a brother to procure his mother from his uncle...
