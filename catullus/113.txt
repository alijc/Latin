CXIII. ad Gaium Helvium Cinnam

Consule Pompeio primum duo, Cinna, solebant
     Maeciliam: facto consule nunc iterum
manserunt duo, sed creverunt milia in unum
     singula. fecundum semen adulterio.


to Gaius Helvius Cinna

The first time around Consul Pompey and his mate, Cinna, were wont
to do Maecilia: after being made consul again now
they remained two, but seemed a thousand each.
Semen grows fertile through adultery.
