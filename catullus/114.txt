CXIV. ad Mentulam

Firmanus saltu non falso Mentula diues
     fertur, qui tot res in se habet egregias,
aucupium omne genus, piscis, prata, arva ferasque.
     nequiquam: fructus sumptibus exsuperat.
quare concedo sit diues, dum omnia desint.
     saltum laudemus, dum modo ipse egeat.

to Mentula

Rich Mentula, who himself has so many excellent things,
is supported by an honest to goodness estate in Fermo,
with every kind of game-bird, fish, meadows, plowed fields and beasts.
But in vain: its profits don't cover its expenses.
Therefore I allow that he might be rich, so long as everything is  wanting.
We commend the estate, so long as he himself lacks the means.
