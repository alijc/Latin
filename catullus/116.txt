CXVI. ad Gellium

Saepe tibi studioso animo venante requirens
carmina uti possem mittere Battiadae,
qui te lenirem nobis, neu conarere
tela infesta mittere in usque caput,
hunc video mihi nunc frustra sumptum esse laborem,
Gelli, nec nostras hic valuisse preces.
contra nos tela ista tua evitabimus amitha
at fixus nostris tu dabis supplicium.

Often, seeking poems to send to Battiades
for you, who hunt with a zealous mind, 
with which I might mollify you to us, and try not
to cast annoying barbs all the way to your head
(which has, I now see, taken up the effort in vain),
Gellius, and that our prayers have not in this way borne fruit.
Instead we will avoid these barbs that you've thrown
but pierced by ours you will suffer punishment.
