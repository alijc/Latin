CXVI. ad Gellium

Saepe tibi studioso animo venante requirens
carmina uti possem mittere Battiadae,
qui te lenirem nobis, neu conarere
tela infesta mittere in usque caput,
hunc video mihi nunc frustra sumptum esse laborem,
Gelli, nec nostras hic valuisse preces.
contra nos tela ista tua evitabimus amitha
at fixus nostris tu dabis supplicium.

often to you, hunting with an eager mind, seeking
songs/poems st that I can send to Battiada,
who >you I might mollify to us, or/and not to try
web/darts dangerous to send into all the way head,
>thins I see to me now in vain it have taken up the labor,
Gellius, and not >our requests/prayers here to prevail.
against us these darts of yours we will avois my aunt(!)
but fixed to our you will give suffering/supplication/punishment.
