LIV. de Octonis capite

Othonis caput oppido est pusillum,
et eri rustice semilauta crura,
subtile et leve peditum Libonis,
si non omnia, displicere vellem
tibi et Sufficio seni recocto...
irascere iterum meis iambis
inmerentibus, unice imperator.

LIV. on the eight heads????

Otho's head is altogether tiny,
and its owner's rusticly half-washed shins,
fine and light of feet of Libo,
if not all things, I'd like to displease
you and I am sufficient to a reheated old man ...
to get mad again to my iams
undeserving, especially you are to be commanded.
