DESCRIPTIO INSVLAE

Britannia, insularum optima,
in occidentali occeano inter Galliam et Hiberniam sita,
octingenta milia in longum, ducenta uero in latum continens, 25
quicquid mortalium usui congruit indeficienti fertilitate ministrat.
Omni etenim genere metalli fecunda,
campos late pansos habet, colles quoque praepollenti culturae aptos,
in quibus frugum diuersitates ubertate glebae temporibus suis proueniunt.
Habet et nemora uniuersis ferarum generibus repleta,
quorum in saltibus et alternandis animalium pastibus gramina conueniunt
et aduolantibus apibus flores diuersorum colorum mella distribuunt.
Habet etiam prata sub aeriis montibus amoeno situ uirentia,
in quibus fontes lucidi, per nitidos riuos leni murmure manantes,
pignus suauis soporis in ripis accubantibus irritant.

A DESCRIPTION OF THE ISLAND

Britain, the noblest of islands,
is situated in the western ocean between Gaul and Ireland,
enclosing a length of eight hundred miles and a width of two hundred,
and supplies whatever is suited for mortals' use with its unfailing fertility.
It is indeed rich in every sort of metal, and has wide expansive plains,
and also hills suitable for flourishing cultivation,
in which, with the fertility of soil, a diversity of crops prospers
in their own seasons.
Also, it has forests filled with every sort of wild beast,
in whose glades are both grass fit for alternating pastures of animals
and flowers of diverse colors that  distribute honey to bees that fly to them.
It also has, charmingly sited under towering mountains, verdent meadows
in which clear springs, flowing with gentle murmurs in shining streams,
invoke a pledge of pleasant sleep to those who lie on their banks.

Porro lacubus atque piscosis fluuiis irrigua est
et absque meridianae plagae freto, quo ad Gallias nauigatur,
tria nobilia flumina, Tamensis uidelicet et Sabrinae nec non et Humbri,
uelut tria brachia extendit,
quibus transmarina commercia ex uniuersis nationibus eidem nauigio feruntur.
Bis denis etiam bisque quaternis ciuitatibus olim decorata erat,
quarum quaedam dirutis moeniis in desertis locis squalescunt,
quaedam uero adhuc integrae templa sanctorum cum turribus perpulcra 40
proceritate erecta continent,
in quibus religiosi coetus uirorum ac mulierum obsequium Deo iuxta Christianam
traditionem praestant.
Postremo quinque inhabitatur populis, Normannis uidelicet atque Britannis,
Saxonibus, Pictis, et Scotis;
ex quibus Britones olim ante ceteros a mari usque ad mare insederunt
donec ultione diuina propter ipsorum superbiam superueniente
Pictis et Saxonibus cesserunt.
Qualiter uero et unde applicuerunt restat nunc perarare ut in subsequentibus explicabitur.

What's more, it is well watered with lakes and rivers teeming with fish and,
in addition to the channel to its south, over which one can sail to Gaul,
extends three remarkable rivers, the Thames and the Severn, obviously,
and the Humber no less, just like three arms,
over which overseas commerce from all nations can be carried on the same ship.
It had formerly been graced with eight and twenty cities,
some of which are turning into deserted places, with razed walls,
while others indeed thus far preserve intact shrines of saints
with beautiful towers erected on a height,
in which religious companies of men and women offer obedience to God
according to the Christian tradition.
Lastly, it is inhabited by five peoples, the Normans obviously,
also the Britons, Saxons, Picts and Scots;
of these the Britons once occupied the land from sea to sea before the others
until, when divine retribution came down on them on account of their pride,
they yielded to the Picts and Saxons.
Truly, it remains now to inscribe how and from where they landed,
to set it forth in what follows.
