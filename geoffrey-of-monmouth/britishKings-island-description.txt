DESCRIPTIO INSVLAE

Britannia, insularum optima,
in occidentali occeano inter Galliam et Hiberniam sita,
octingenta milia in longum, ducenta uero in latum continens, 25
quicquid mortalium usui congruit indeficienti fertilitate ministrat.
Omni etenim genere metalli fecunda,
campos late pansos habet, colles quoque praepollenti culturae aptos,
in quibus frugum diuersitates ubertate glebae temporibus suis proueniunt.
Habet et nemora uniuersis ferarum generibus repleta,
quorum in saltibus et alternandis animalium pastibus gramina conueniunt
et aduolantibus apibus flores diuersorum colorum mella distribuunt.
Habet etiam prata sub aeriis montibus amoeno situ uirentia,
in quibus fontes lucidi, per nitidos riuos leni murmure manantes,
pignus suauis soporis in ripis accubantibus irritant.

A DESCRIPTION OF THE ISLAND

Britain, the noblest of islands,
is situated in the western ocean between Gaul and Ireland,
enclosing a length of eight hundred miles and a width of two hundred,
and supplies whatever is suited for mortals' use with its unfailing fertility.
It is indeed rich in every sort of metal, and has wide expansive plains,
and also hills suitable for flourishing cultivation,
in which, with the fertility of soil, a diversity of crops prospers
in their own seasons.
Also, it has forests filled with every sort of wild beast,
in whose glades are both grass fit for alternating pastures of animals
and flowers of diverse colors that  distribute honey to bees that fly to them.
It also has, charmingly sited under towering mountains, verdent meadows
in which clear springs, flowing with gentle murmurs in shining streams,
invoke a pledge of pleasant sleep to those who lie on their banks.

Porro lacubus atque piscosis fluuiis irrigua est
et absque meridianae plagae freto, quo ad Gallias nauigatur,
tria nobilia flumina, Tamensis uidelicet et Sabrinae nec non et Humbri,
uelut tria brachia extendit,
quibus transmarina commercia ex uniuersis nationibus eidem nauigio feruntur.
Bis denis etiam bisque quaternis ciuitatibus olim decorata erat,
quarum quaedam dirutis moeniis in desertis locis squalescunt,
quaedam uero adhuc integrae templa sanctorum cum turribus perpulcra 40
proceritate erecta continent,
in quibus religiosi coetus uirorum ac mulierum obsequium Deo iuxta Christianam
traditionem praestant.
Postremo quinque inhabitatur populis, Normannis uidelicet atque Britannis,
Saxonibus, Pictis, et Scotis;
ex quibus Britones olim ante ceteros a mari usque ad mare insederunt
donec ultione diuina propter ipsorum superbiam superueniente
Pictis et Saxonibus cesserunt.
Qualiter uero et unde applicuerunt restat nunc perarare ut in subsequentibus explicabitur.

Further, it is well watered with lakes and rivers teeming with fish
and apart from the strait of southern region, by which to Gaul is sailed,
three remarkable rivers, clearly the Thames and Severn and no less the Humber,
just as it extends three branches,
by which overseas commerce from all nations to the same ship are
brought/carried.
It had once been graced with twice ten still and twice four cities,
of which certain(ff) toby having been razed walls in deserted places start to
get dirty,
certain which(ff) indeed thus far untouched(ff) shrines of saints with beautiful
towers toby height erected preserve,
in which religious companies of men and women obedience to God like
Christian tradition they excel.
Lastly, it is inhabited by five peoples, the Normans clearly, and the Britons,
Saxons, Picts and Scots;
from which the Britons formerly before the rest from sea to sea settled
until with divine vengeance arriving on account of their pride
they submitted to the Picts and Saxons.
Just as indeed and whence they landed it remains now to inscribe
so that in following it will be explained.
