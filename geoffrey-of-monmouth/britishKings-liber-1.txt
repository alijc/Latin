Aeneas post Troianum bellum excidium urbis cum Ascanio filio diffugiens Italiam nauigio adiuit.

BOOK I

After the Trojan War, Aeneas fled the destruction of his city with his son
Ascanius, and came to Italy by ship.
There, after he was received with honor by King Latinus,
Turnus, the king of the Rutulians, grew jealous of him and engaged him in battle.
Therefore in fighting these men,
Aeneas prevailed, killed Turnus, and won the kingdom of Italy and Lavinia,
the daughter of Latinus.
In the end, when the day of Aeneas' funeral rites came, Ascanius, elevated to royal power,
founded Alba on the Tiber and had a son, named Silvius.
This man was partial to furtive venery, and
married a granddaughter of Lavinia and got her pregnant.
And when this was discovered by his father Ascanius,
he ordered his wise men to ascertain the gender of the child that the girl had conceived.
