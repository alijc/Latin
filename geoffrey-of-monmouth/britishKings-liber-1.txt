LIBER I

Aeneas post Troianum bellum excidium urbis cum Ascanio filio diffugiens Italiam nauigio adiuit.
Ibi cum a Latino rege honorifice receptus esset,
inuidit Turnus rex Rutulorum et cum illo congressus est.
Dimicantibus ergo illis,
praeualuit Aeneas peremptoque Turno regnum Italiae et Lauiniam filiam Latini adeptus est.
Denique, suprema die ipsius superueniente, Ascanius,
regia potestate sublimatus,
condidit Albam super Tyberim genuitque filium cui nomen erat Siluius.
Hic, furtiuae ueneri indulgens, nupsit cuidam nepti Lauiniae eamque fecit praegnantem.
Cumque id Ascanio patri compertum esset,
praecepit magis suis explorare quem sexum puella concepisset.

BOOK I

After the Trojan War, Aeneas fled the destruction of his city with his son
Ascanius, and came to Italy by ship.
There, after he was received with honor by King Latinus,
Turnus, the king of the Rutulians, grew jealous of him and engaged him in battle.
Therefore in fighting these men,
Aeneas prevailed, killed Turnus, and won the kingdom of Italy and Lavinia,
the daughter of Latinus.
In the end, when the day of Aeneas' funeral rites came, Ascanius, elevated to royal power,
founded Alba on the Tiber and had a son, named Silvius.
This man was partial to furtive venery, and
married a granddaughter of Lavinia and got her pregnant.
And when this was discovered by his father Ascanius,
he ordered his wise men to ascertain the gender of the child that the girl had conceived.

Certitudine ergo rei comperta,
dixerunt magi ipsam grauidam esse puero qui patrem et matrem interficeret,
pluribus quoque terris in exilium peragratis ad summum tandem culmen honoris perueniret.
Nec fefellit eos uaticinium suum.
Nam ut dies partus accessit, edidit mulier puerum et in natiuitate eius mortua est;
traditur autem ille obstetrici et uocatur Brutus.
Postremo, cum ter quini anni emensi essent,
comitabatur iuuenis patrem in uenando ipsumque inopino ictu sagittae interfecit;
nam dum famuli ceruos in occursum eorum ducerent, Brutus,
telum in ipsos dirigere affectans, genitorem sub pectore percussit.
Quo mortuo, expulsus est ab Italia,
indignantibus parentibus ipsum tantum facinus fecisse.
Exulatus ergo adiuit partes Graeciae et inuenit progeniem Heleni filii Priami,
quae sub potestate Pandrasi regis Graecorum in seruitutem tenebatur;
Pirrus etenim filius Achillis post euersionem Troiae
praedictum Helenum compluresque alios secum in uinclis abduxerat et
ut necem patris sui in ipsos uindicaret in captionem teneri praeceperat.

And so, when they were sure, 
the wise men said that she was pregnant with a boy who would kill his father and mother,
and would also travel to and fro over many lands in exile
before finally achieving the utmost peak of honor.
And their prophesy did not deceive them.
For when the day of the birth arrived, the woman bore a boy and died in birthing him;
but he was handed to a midwife and named Brutus.
Finally, after thrice five years had passed,
the youth goes hunting with his father and kills him with a wayward arrow;
for while the servants were driving the deer towards their encounter, Brutus,
in directing his shaft into them, pierced his progenitor under the breast.
And, after his father died, he was banished from Italy,
with his grandparents despising him for having committed so great a crime.
And so, the exile visited regions of Greece and discovered the descendents of Helenus, the son
of Priam,
that were being held in servitude under the reign of Pandrasus, the king of the Greeks;
indeed, after the destruction of Troy, Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles,
had carried off the aforementioned Helenus in chains, along with many others,
and had ordered them to be held in captivity, to avenge his father's slaughter.


Agnita igitur ueterum conciuium prosapia, moratus est Brutus apud eos.
In tantum autem militia et probitate uigere coepit ita
ut a regibus et principibus prae omni iuuentute patriae amaretur;
erat enim inter sapientes sapiens, inter bellicosos bellicosus,
et quicquid auri uel argenti siue ornamentorum adquirebat totum militibus erogabat.
Diuulgata itaque per uniuersas nationes ipsius fama,
Troiani coeperunt ad eum confluere,
orantes ut ipso duce a seruitute Graecorum liberarentur,
quod leuiter fieri asserebant,
cum in tantum iam infra patriam multiplicati essent ita ut septem milia,
exceptis paruulis et mulieribus, computarentur.
Praeterea erat quidam nobilissimus iuuenis in Graecia nomine Assaracus
qui partibus eorum fauebat.
Ex Troiana namque matre natus erat fiduciamque in illis habebat maximam
ut auxilio eorum inquietudini Graecorum resistere quiuisset.
Arguebat enim eum frater suus propter tria castella
quae sibi moriens pater donauerat
et ea auferre conabatur quia ex concubina natus fuerat.
Erat autem frater patre et matre Graecus
asciueratque regem ceterosque Graecos parti suae fauere.
Inspiciens ergo Brutus et uirorum multitudinem
et Assaraci castella quae sibi patebant,
securius petitioni illorum adquieuit.

And so, after recognizing their lineage from his ancient countrymen, Brutus stayed on with them.
And he commenced to thrive so much in courage and honesty 
that he was loved by kings and princes above every youth in the land;
for he was wise among wise men, warlike among warlike ones,
and whatever gold or silver or jewels he obtained he paid it all out to his soldiers.
And so as his fame spread through all the nations, the Trojans began to flock to him,
begging that he lead them and liberate them from the servitude of the Greeks,
which they declared would be easily done,
since after leaving their native land they had already multiplied so much
that they were reckoned at seven thousand, not counting women and children.
In addition, there was a certain noble youth in Greece, Assaracus by name, who favored their faction.
For he'd been born of a Trojan mother and he had the greatest confidence in them,
that he'd be able, with their aid, to resist the disturbances of the Greeks.
For his brother was denouncing him on account of three castles
that their father had granted to him when he died
and his brother was trying to take them because Assaracus had been born out of wedlock.
But the brother was Greek on both sides of the family
and had induced the king and the other Greeks to favor his side.
And so Brutus considered both the multitude of men
and Assaracus' castles, which were open to him,
and confidently acquiesced to their petition.


Erectus igitur in ducem, conuocat undique Troianos et oppida Assaraci munit.
Ipse autem et Assaracus cum tota multitudine uirorum et mulierum
quae eis adhaerebat nemora et colles occupant.
Deinde litteras suas regi in haec uerba direxit:

'Pandraso regi Graecorum Brutus dux reliquiarum Troiae salutem.
Quia indignum fuerat gentem praeclaro genere Dardani ortam aliter in regno tuo
tractari quam serenitas nobilitatis eius expeteret, sese infra abdita nemorum recepit;
praeferebat namque ferino ritu, carnibus uidelicet et herbis,
uitam cum libertate sustentare quam uniuersis deliciis refocillata diutius sub
iugo seruitutis tuae permanere.
Quod si celsitudinem potentiae tuae offendit, non est ei imputandum sed uenia adhibenda,
cum cuiusque captiui communis sit intentio uelle ad pristinam dignitatem redire.
Misericordia igitur super eam motus, amissam libertatem largiri digneris
et saltus nemorum quos ut seruitutem diffugeret occupauit eam habitare permittas.
Sin autem, concede ut ad aliarum terrarum nationes cum licentia tua abscedant'.

And so he was elevated to their leader
and assembled Trojans from all over to fortify Assaracus' towns.
But he himself and Assaracus, along with the whole multitude of men
and the women who were attached to them, occupied the forests and hills.
Then he directed a letter to the king, in these words:

'To Pandrasus, the king of the Greeks,
Brutus the leader of the remnants of the Trojans sends greetings.
Because it was shameful for a people descended from the noble ancestry of
Dardanus to be treated in your kingdom contrary to the way
that the favorable conditions of its nobility would demand,
they have withdrawn into the concealment of the forests;
for they prefer to sustain life like wild beasts, with flesh and herbs,
with liberty than to remain longer under the yoke of your servitude,
even if refreashed by all delicacies.
But if it offends Your Highness, they should not be accused but rather forgiven,
since it is the intention of each public captive to wish to return to their former dignity.
Therefore, moved with sympathy for them, may you deem it worthy to grant them their lost liberty
and permit them to inhabit the glades of the forests that they have seized in order to flee servitude.
But if you cannot do so, grant them leave to depart to peoples of other lands.'


Pandrasus ergo, agnita litterarum sententia,
ultra modum admiratus est ipsos quos in seruitutem tenuerat tanta audacia habundasse
ut ei talia mandata dirigerent.
Conuocato itaque procerum suorum consilio,
exercitum colligere decreuit ut ipsos persequeretur.
Dum autem deserta quibus eos adesse  auctumauerat per oppidum Sparatinum peteret,
egressus est Brutus cum tribus milibus uirorum
ipsumque nichil huiusmodi praemeditatum ex inprouiso inuasit.
Audito namque aduentu ipsius, sese in praedicto oppido praeterita proxima nocte inmiserat
in ipsos inermes et sine ordine ituros inopinam irruptionem faceret.
Impetu itaque facto, inuadunt acriter Troiani et stragem ingerere nituntur.
Porro Graeci confestim stupefacti in omnes partes dilabuntur
et rege suo praecedente fluuium Akalon, qui prope fluebat, transire festinant;
at in transeundo infra uoraginem fluctus periclitantur.
Quos diffugientes Brutus infestat, infestatos uero partim in undis partim super ripam prosternit,
et nunc hac nunc illac discurrens duplicem necem ipsis ingestam esse laetatur.
Quod ut Antigonus frater Pandrasi intuitus est,
ultra modum doluit reuocauitque uagantes socios in turmam
et celeri impetu in saeuientes Troas reuersus est;
malebat namque resistendo interire quam ignauam fugam faciens luteis gurgitibus submergi.

Therefore after Pandrasus learned the contents of the letter,
he was astounded beyond measure that those whom he had held in servitude were
so filled with audacity as to send him such a mandate.
And so he convened a council of his nobles
and resolved to assemble an army to attack them.
But when, on his way to the deserted places where he thought them to be,
he passed the town of Sparatinum, Brutus marched out with three thousand men
and fell upon him without warning.
Indeed, when he heard of their approach the night before,
he had inserted himself in that town in order to launch a surprise attack on them
when they were defenseless and disordered in their advance.
And so when the assault had been made,
the Trojans attacked fiercely and tried to wipe them out.
After that the Greeks were immediately stunned and fled in all directions and,
with their king leading the way, rushed to cross the River Akalon, which flowed nearby;
but in the crossing they were imperiled by a whirlpool.
And Brutus harassed them as they scattered, indeed,
he struck some of them down in the waves and others on the bank,
and racing about now this way and now that,
he rejoiced that a twofold death had been thrust upon them.
When Pandrasus' brother Antigonus saw this,
he suffered beyond measure and called his scattered comrades back into formation
and in a swift charge swung back against the raging Trojans;
indeed he preferred perishing in resistance to making a cowardly flight
and drowning in a muddy whirlpool.

Densa igitur acie incedens,
socios uiriliter resistere hortatur letiferaque tela totis uiribus contorquet.
Sed parum uel minime profecit; nam Troes armis muniti erant, ceteri uero inermes.
Vnde audatiores insistentes caedem miserandam inferebant
nec eos hoc modo infestare quieuerunt donec cunctis fere
interfectis Antigonum et Anacletum eiusdem socium retinuerunt.

Brutus uero, potitus uictoria, oppidum sexcentis militibus muniuit
petiuitque nemorum abdita ubi Troiana plebs praesidium illius expectabat.
At Pandrasus, ob fugam suam fratrisque captionem anxiatus,
nocte illa populum dilapsum resociare uacauit
et cum postera lux redisset obsidere oppidum cum resociato populo progressus est;
arbitrabatur enim Brutum inmisisse se infra ipsum cum Antigono
ceterisque captiuis quos ceperat.
Vt igitur moenibus accessit,
explorato castelli situ distribuit exercitum suum per turmas et per diuersas
partes in circuitu locauit.
Indixit etiam ut alii egressum inclusis abnegarent,
alii cursus fluminum auerterent,
alii crebris arietibus ceterisque machinationibus murorum compagem dissoluerent.
Qui praecepta eius effectibus exequentes omni nisu contendebant
quibus modis obsessos crudelius infestarent.

And so, advancing in close formation,
he urged his comrades to resist like men and brandished his deadly weapons with all his might.
But he accomplished little enough;
for while the Trojans were fortified with weapons, the others were unarmed.
Hence the bolder men pressed on and carried out a pitiable slaughter 
and did not rest from harassing them in this way until nearly all of them had been killed.
But they took Antigonus and his comrade Anacletus prisoner.

Indeed, Brutus, having won the victory, fortified the town with six hundred soldiers
and sought out the forests where the Trojan civilians hid, awaiting his protection.
But Pandrasus, anxious for his own flight and his brother's capture,
had time to reunite his scattered people that night
and, when dawn returned, advanced to besiege the town with his allies;
for he believed that Brutus had shut himself up in it with Antigonus
and the rest of the captives that he had taken.
Therefore as he approached the walls,
after reconnoitering the site of the fortress, he divided his army into troops
and stationed them in different positions around it.
He likewise ordered some to deny egress to those within,
others to divert the course of the rivers,
and others to destroy parts of the walls with thick battering rams and other war-engines.
And those who carried out his commands contended with every exertion
in which ways they might harass the besieged more cruelly.



Superueniente autem nocte, audatiores eligebant qui dum ceteri labore fessi
quietem caperent soporis castra et tentoria ab hostium furtiua incursione
tuerentur.

At obsessi, in edito murorum astantes, totis uiribus nituntur ut ipsorum
machinationes contrariis machinationibus repellant et nunc tela nunc sulphureas
taedas eicientes sese unanimiter defendere intendunt.
Cum autem parata testudine murus suffoderetur,
Graeco igne atque calidarum aquarum aspergine hostes retrocedere cogebant.
Cibi tandem penuria et cotidiano labore afflicti, legatum ad Brutum miserunt,
postulantes ut eis in auxilium festinaret;
timebant enim ne in debilitatem redacti oppidum deserere cogerentur.
Brutus ergo, opem subuectare affectans, internis anxietatibus cruciatur quia tot
milites non habebat quot sibi ad campestre proelium committendum sufficerent.


Now when night was falling, they chose the bolder men to guard the camp and
tents from any stealthy incursion, while the rest, weary with toil, seized
the rest of deep sleep.

But the besieged stood on the top of the city walls and struggled with all their
might to fend off their adversary's engines of war with their own, and exerted
themselves to a man, casting now darts, now pitch torches to defend
themselves.  But even after the wall was undermined with a 'tortoise' that had
been built, they used Greek fire and a spray of boiling water to force the enemy
to withdraw.  In the end, weakened by their lack of food and daily toil, they
sent a messenger to Brutus, asking him to rush to them in aid; for they feared
that they'd be reduced to weakness and forced to quit the town.  And so Brutus,
wanting to carry aid up to them, was tormented with an inner anxiety because he
didn't have as many soldiers as he needed to engage in open battle.


Callido deinde usus consilio,
proponit castra hostium noctu adire ipsosque soporatos,
deceptis eorundem uigilibus, interficere.
Quoniam autem id fieri non posse callebat absque alicuius Graeci assensu et auxilio,
Anacletum socium Antigoni ad se uocauit
illumque euaginato gladio in hunc modum affatus est:

'Egregie iuuenis, finis uitae tuae Antigonique adest nisi ea quae tibi
praecipiam executurus uoluntati meae fideliter adquieueris.
Affecto enim in hac sequenti nocte castra Graecorum adire
ut ipsos inopina caede afficiam,
sed timeo ne eorum uigiles, comperto dolo, inceptum meum impediant.
Quia ergo uerti arma in illos prius oporteret, desiderarem eos per te decipere ut tutiorem aditum aggrediendi ceteros haberem.
Tu uero, callide negotium huiusmodi agens,
in secunda noctis hora uade ad obsidionem,
et quemque fallacibus uerbis demulcendo dices te Antigonum a carceribus meis abduxisse usque ad conuallem nemorum et in eadem illum inter frutices delituisse nec longius abire posse propter compedes quibus eum impeditum simulaueris.
Deinde duces eos ad exitum nemoris quasi ipsum liberaturos, ubi cum armata manu adero paratus illos perimere'.

Anacletus igitur, uiso gladio qui inter haec uerba morti suae imminebat,
continuo perterritus iureiurando promisit sese praeceptum illud executurum si sibi et Antigono diuturnior uita concederetur.
Confirmato denique foedere, in secunda noctis hora, quae iam instabat, uersus obsidionem iussum iter arripuit. 
Cum tandem prope castra incederet, occurrunt undique uigiles qui abdita locorum explorabant;
 quaerunt quoque aduentus ipsius causam et utrum ad prodendum exercitum aduenisset. 
Quibus ille, ingentem laeticiam simulans, in haec uerba respondit:

Then, making use of a crafty plan, he proposed to attack the enemy camp by
night and to kill the sleeping men, after eluding their sentries.
But since he couldn't figure out how it could be done without
the assent and aid of some Greek, he summoned Anacletus, the comrade of
Antigonus, and addressed him, with sword unsheathed, in this way:

'Excellent young man, the end of your life and that of Antigonus is at hand,
unless you agree to faithfully carry out what I am going to order you to do.
For in this coming night I mean to attack the Greeks' camp
to afflict those men with sudden death,
but I fear that their sentries might discover the deceit and forestall my undertaking.
Therefore it behooves me to turn arms against them first, and I want
to trick the men through you, and have a safe means of attacking the others.
Indeed, sneakily performing this sort of business,
go to the stockade in the second hour of the night,
and tell them, pretending with charming treacherous words,
that you have released Antigonus from my captivity
and have brought him to a forested valley and hidden him in the bushes,
and that he can go no further because he's encumbered with shackles.
Then you will lead them to the entrance of the forest as if going to free him,
where I will be with an armed band, prepared to destroy them.'

And so Anacletus, looking at the sword that, along with these words, threatened his
death, was terrified and immediately swore an oath, promising that he would
carry out that command, if he and Antigonus be granted their lives.
In the end, with the compact assured, in the second hour of the night, which
was already approaching, he took the commanded trip back to the stockade.
When he finally got close to the camp sentries, who were scouting hidden positions,
rushed at him from every side; and they demanded the reason for his arrival
and whether he had come to betray the army.
And he, pretending an unnatural joy, answered them in these words:


'Non equidem proditor meae gentis uenio, sed carcerem Troianorum euadens
ad uos orans diffugio ut mecum ad uestrum Antigonum ueniatis,
quem ex uinculis Bruti eripui.
Illum quidem, pondere compedum detentum,
paulo ante in exitu nemoris inter frutices delitere iussi
donec aliquos inuenirem quos ad liberandum eum conducerem'.

Dubitantibus autem illis utrum uerum diceret,
superuenit unus qui eum agnouerat et salutato ipso indicauit sociis quis esset.
At illi, nichil haesitantes, ceteros qui aberant ocius conuocauerunt
et secuti sunt eum usque ad siluam qua Antigonum delitere praedixerat.
Illis denique inter frutices progredientibus,
emergit se Brutus cum armatis cateruis et
facto impetu ipsos ocius perterritos dirissima caede affecit.
Deinde profectus est ad obsidionem et diuisit
socios suos per tres turmas praecepitque
ut singulae singulas partes castrorum sapienter et sine tumultu adirent
nec intromissae caedem alicui ingererent
donec ipse cum sua cohorte tentorio regis potitus lituum suum in signum ipsis sonaret.

'Truly, I come not as a traitor to my people,
but escaping in flight from the Trojans' captivity,
and begging you to come with me to your Antigonus,
whom I have rescued from Brutus' chains.
Indeed, he was hampered by the weight of his shackles, and 
a little while ago I told him to hide in the bushes at the entrance of the forest,
until I could find someone to bring to liberate him.'

Now while they were deliberating whether he spoke the truth,
a man arrived who knew him. And after greeting him revealed who he was to his companions.
And they, without hesitation, swiftly gathered the other men, who were absent,
and followed him right up to the forest, where he had said that Antigonus was hiding.
Finally, when they advanced among the bushes,
Brutus appeared with armed bands and in an assault
swiftly afflicted the terrified men with a dreadful slaughter.
Then he set out to the stockade and divided his companions into three troops and
ordered each of them to occupy a separate part of the camp, senisibly and without commotion 
and not to thrust a massacre onto any part that they'd entered
until he, with his cohort, had taken possession of the king's tent and
sounded a signal on his trumpet to them.


Porro, ut ipsos quicquid acturi erant edocuit, confestim mittunt se leniter
infra castra et iussas partes adepti promissum signum expectant; quod Brutus
eis dare non distulit postquam stetit ante tentorium Pandrasi, quod super
omnia adire aestuabat. Quo audito, enses ocius euaginant, cubilia sopitorum
ingrediuntur, letiferos ictus ingeminant, et nullam pietatem habentes castra 
in hunc modum deambulant. Ad gemitus ergo morientium euigilant ceteri
uisisque laniatoribus uelut oues ex inprouiso a lupis occupatae stupefacti
fiunt; nichil enim praesidii expectabant, cum neque arma capiendi neque
fugam faciendi congruum spacium haberent. Discurrunt etiam sine armis
inter armatos quo impetus eos ducebat, sed irruentibus ceteris continuo 
dilacerantur. Qui semiuiuus euadebat, auiditate fugae festinans, scopulis
uel fruticibus allidebatur et infelicem animam cum sanguine emittebat.
Qui solo clipeo uel quolibet alio tegmine munitus inter eosdem scopulos
incidebat, timore mortis celer, sub obscura nocte cadebat;
cadenti quoque uel brachia uel crura frangebantur.
Cui neutrum horum contingebat, inscius 
quo fugam faceret, in prope fluentibus fluuiis submergebatur.
Vix aliquis illaesus abibat quin aliquo infortunio periclitaretur.
Oppidani quoque agnito commilitonum aduentu egressi cladem quae dabatur dupplicabant.

After he instructed them on what to do, they straightway slipped into the camp,
and, after occupying their designated positions, waited for the promised signal;
which Brutus gave them as soon as he stood before Pandrasus' tent,
which he was burning to attack.
And on hearing it they swiftly unsheathed their swords,
entered the sleeping men's quarters, redoubled deadly blows,
and ranged through the camp in this way without pity.
And so the others woke to the groans of the dying, and were stupefied,
seeing their butchers just like sheep unexpectedly seized by wolves;
for they looked for no aid, not having time to either take up arms or flee.
They dashed about hither and yon, the unarmed among the armed,
wherever the impulse led them,
but they were torn to pieces whenever the Trojans attacked.
And whoever escaped, half-alive and avidly hastening to flight,
was battered by rocks or bushes and cast away his hapless life with his blood.
And whoever was protected only by a shield or some other armor
fell among the same rocks, swift with the fear of death, fell in the dark night;
and in the fall either arms or legs were broken.
And whoever neither of these happened to,
not knowing where to flee to, was sunk into nearby flowing rivers.
Hardly anyone got away uninjured and all were imperiled with some misfortune.
And when those in the town learned that their comrades had come,
they marched out and doubled the calamity that had been bestowed.


At Brutus, tentorium regis ut praedictum est nactus,
ipsum uincire et conseruare uacauit;
deliberabat enim se magis uita illius quam morte adepturum quod affectauerat.
Turma autem quae cum eo erat non cessabat stragem facere;
quae partem quam sortita fuerat usque ad internitionem deleuerat.
Vt igitur noctem in hunc modum consumpserunt et sub luce
aurorae tanta ruina patuit populi, Brutus, maximo gaudio fluctuans, socciis
peractae caedis spolia peremptorum iuxta libitum suum tractare permittit;
deinde cum rege oppidum ingreditur, expectaturus dum gazas distribuerent.
Quibus impertitis,
muniuit iterum castellum et cadauera dari sepulturae praecepit,
resociatisque cateruis ad nemora cum laeta remeauit uictoria.
Quae ut tantam laeticiam animis cunctorum infudit,
inclitus dux maiores natu conuocauit quaesiuitque ab illis quid a Pandraso petendum laudarent; 
nam cum in potestate eorum positus esset,
per omnia peticioni ipsorum adquiesceret si liber abire sineretur.
Mox illi, diuersis affectibus diuersa cupientes,
pars partem regni ad inhabitandum petere hortatur,
pars uero licentiam abeundi et ea quae itineri suo utilia forent.

Now once Brutus gained control of the king's tents, as has we have already
said, he was able to tie him up and hold on to him;
for he decided that he wanted the king's life more than his death.
But the troop of soldiers that accompanied him kept up the slaughter;
and they ravaged their assigned location, right up until daybreak.
And so, as the people spent the night in this way and spread such destruction
until the light of dawn, Brutus, swelling with great joy,
allowed the soldiers who had carried out the slaughter
to drag off the spoils of the slain at their pleasure;
then he entered the town with the king,
to wait until they should divvy up the treasury.
And when these had been handed out,
he refortified the citadel and ordered the corpses to be buried,
and with his companies reunited, returned to the forest in joyful victory.
And as that victory poured such joy into the hearts of all the men,
the renowned general called together those of notable birth and
asked them what they'd recommend to be demanded of Pandrasus;
for since he was in their power,
he'd completely acquiesce to their petition
if he were allowed to depart as a free man.
They wanted different things due to differing feelings -
one side urged him to ask the king for a region to live in,
while another wanted the liberty to leave and provisions for their journey.


Cumque diu in ambiguo extitissent, surrexit unus ex illis,
Mempricius nomine, rogatoque silentio audientibus ceteris ait:

'Vt quid haesitatis, patres, in his quae saluti uestrae reor esse habenda?
Vnum petendum est, licentia uidelicet eundi,
si uobis posterisque uestris aeternam pacem habere desideraueritis.
Nam si eo pacto uitam concesseritis Pandraso
ut per eum partem Graeciae adepti inter Danaos manere uelitis,
nunquam diuturna pace fruemini
dum fratres et filii et nepotes eorum quibus hesternam intulistis stragem
uobis uel inmixti uel uicini fuerint.
Semper enim necis parentum suorum memores, aeterno uos habebunt odio;
quibusque etiam nugis incitati, uindictam sumere nitentur.
Nec uobis, pauciorem turbam habentibus,
ea uis est ut tot ciuium inquietationi resistere queatis.
Quod si decertatio inter uos accesserit,
numerus eorum cotidie augebitur, uester uero minuetur.
Laudo igitur ut petatis ab illo filiam suam primogenitam, quam Innogin uocant,
ad opus ducis nostri, et cum ea aurum et argentum,
naues et frumentum et quodcunque itineri nostro necessarium erit;
et si id impetrare poterimus, licentia sua alias nationes petamus'.


And after they'd gone back and forth for a long time,
one of them, Mempricius by name, stood up and asked for silence,
then spoke to the others:

'Why do you hesitate, fathers, in these matters that
I believe need to be considered for your safety?
Clearly only one thing needs to be sought, permission to depart,
if you desire to have a lasting peace for yourselves and your descendents.
For if you trade Pandrasus' life for an agreement
to remain in a part of Greece acquired among the Greeks,
you will never enjoy a long-lasting peace
so long as the brothers and sons and grandsons of those whom you slaughtered
yesterday will live either mixed with you or nearby.
For they will always have the memories of the deaths of their parents,
and forever hold you in odium;
and when aroused by mere trifles, they will be pressed to exact vengeance.
And you, with a smaller population, don't have the power
to be able to withstand the harassment of so many citizens.
But if fighting breaks out among you,
their numerical strength will daily increase, while yours will lessen.
Therefore I recommend that you ask him for his first-born daughter,
whom they call Innogin, for our leader's need, and along with her,
gold and silver, ships and supplies and whatever will be needed for our journey;
and if we can obtain it, let us make for other nations with his leave.'


Vt his et consimilibus finem dicendi fecit,
acquieuit ei tota multitudo atque suasit
ut Pandrasus in medium adduceretur et nisi huic peticioni faueret
saeuissima morte dampnaretur.
Nec mora, adductus est et in cathedra celsior ceteris positus.
Edoctus quoque quibus tormentis affligendus erat
nisi faceret quae iubebatur, in hunc modum respondit:

"Quoniam aduersi dii me meumque fratrem Antigonum in manus uestras tradiderunt,
parendum est peticioni uestrae, ne uitam,
quae nobis arbitrio uestro et adimi et concedi potest,
si repulsam passi fueritis amittamus.
Nichil enim uita praestantius, nichil iocundius censeo,
nec est mirandum si illam exteris rebus redimere uelim.
Quamquam tamen inuitus praeceptis uestris oboediam,
solatium habere uideor quia fiham meam tantae probitatis adolescenti daturus sum,
quem ex genere Priami et Anchisae creatum et nobilitas quae in ipso pullulat et
fama nobis cognita declarat.
Quis etenim alter exules Troiae,
in seruitutem tot et tantorum principum positos,
eorumdem uinculis eriperet?
quis cum illis regi Graecorum resisteret aut cum tam paucis tantam armatorum
copiam proelio prouocaret initoque congressu regem eorum uinctum duceret?
Quia ergo tantus iuuenis tanta probitate michi resistere potuit,
do ei filiam meam Innogin;
do etiam aurum et argentum, naues, frumentum uinum et oleum,
et quicquid itineri eius necessarium esse dixeritis.
Et si a proposito uestro diuertentes cum Graecis commanere uolueritis,
tertiam regni mei partem uobis ad inhabitandum concedo;
sin autem, promissa mea effectu prosequar,
et ut securiores sitis uobis quasi obses manebo dum omnia perficiam'.


As he came to an end, saying these and similar things,
the whole crowd acquiesced to him and urged
that Pandrasus be led into their midst and sentenced to a cruel death,
unless he accepted this petition.
And he was led up without delay and placed on a seat higher than the others.
When he'd been informed of the tortures that would be imposed on him
unless he did as he was ordered, he replied in this way:

"Since the gods have turned against me and my brother Antigonus
and have delivered us into your hands,
it behooves us to obey your petition, lest we lose our lives,
which can be either granted and revoked by your will, if we refuse you.
For nothing is better than life, nothing, I think, sweeter,
and it should be no wonder that I'd wish to buy it back with external property.
Nevertheless, reluctant as I am to obey your commands,
I seem to take solace that I'll give my so virtuous daughter to a young man
sprung from Priam and Anchises' line, with a nobility that springs forth
in him and a reputation that makes itself known to us.
Who else could have rescued the exiles of Troy from their chains,
when placed in the servitude of so many great chiefs?
Who could have withstood the king of the Greeks with those men,
or have challenged so many armed men in battle with so few,
and led away their king in fetters after the contest was entered?
Therefore because such an upright youth could withstand me,
I give him my daughter Innogin;
I give besides gold and silver, ships, grain, wine and oil,
and whatever you say is needed for your journey.
And if you turn from your intention and wish to dwell among the Greeks,
I'll give a third part of my kingdom for you to inhabit;
but if otherwise, I will fulfill the promise that I made,
and to keep you safer, I'll remain your hostage until I've accomplished it all."

Conuentione itaque facta, diriguntur legati per uniuersa Graeciae litora colligere naues.
Quae ut collectae fuerunt, trecentae uiginti quatuor numero praesentantur,
omni genere farris onerantur; filia Bruto maritatur;
quisque prout dignitas expetebat auro et argento donatur.
Peractis cunctis, rex liber a carcere, Troes ab eius potestate secundis uentis abscedunt.
At Innogin, in excelsa puppi stans, saepius inter brachia Bruti in extasi collabitur;
fusis quoque cum singultu lacrimis, parentes ac patriam deserere conqueritur,
nec oculos a litore auertit dum litora oculis patuerunt.
Quam Brutus blandiciis mitigans nunc dulces amplexus,
nunc dulcia basia innectit,
nec coeptis suis desistit donec fletu fatigata sopori summittitur.

And so, when the assembly was over, envoys were sent throughout Greece to
obtain ships.
And when they'd been collected, they came to three hundred and twenty-four,
loaded with every sort of grain.
The king's daughter was married to Brutus and
each man was given as much gold and silver as his rank required.
When all had been carried out the king was freed from captivity and the Trojans
departed from his dominion on a favorable wind.
But Innogin, standing on the high poop deck, oftimes collapsed into
Brutus' arms in terror;
and sobbing with flowing tears, lamented leaving her parents and homeland,
and did not turn her eyes from the shore so long as land was visible.
Brutus, soothing her with sweet flatteries, now embraced her, 
now tied sweet kisses on her,
and did not cease what he'd begun until, wearied by weeping, she was relieved by sleep.


Inter haec et alia duobus diebus et una nocte prospero uentorum flatu cucurrerunt applicueruntque
in quandam insulam uocatam Leogetia, quae antiquitus ab incursione
piratarum uastata a nemine inhabitabatur.
In illam ergo misit Brutus trecentos armatos ad explorandum quid inhabitaret;
qui neminem reperientes feras diuersi generis infra saltus ac nemora inuentas caede afficiunt.
Venerunt ad quandam ciuitatem desertam in qua templum Dianae reppererunt.
In eodem imago deae responsa dabat si forte ab aliquo peteretur.
Onerati tandem reperta uenatione,
reuertuntur ad naues suas patriaeque situm et ciuitatem consociis praedicant.
Suggerunt duci templum adire atque litatis donis a numine loci inquirere
quae patria eis sedem certae mansionis praeberet;
communicatoque omnium assensu, assumpsit Brutus secum Gerionem augurem
et duodecim maiores natu petiuitque templum cum omnibus quae
ad sacrificium necessaria erant.

Meanwhile they sped along for another two days and a night on favorable winds
and landed at a certain island called Leogetia, which was uninhabited,
having formerly been ravaged by an incursion of pirates. 
And so Brutus sent three hundred armed men onto this island to scout out what
might live there; and they discovered no-one, but came upon wild animals
of varius sorts among the glades and woods and slaughtered them.
They came to a certain deserted city in which they discovered a temple of Diana.
In this same temple was an image of the goddess, that would give answers if
anyone chanced to ask it.
At last, after loading up on game, they returned to their ship
and told their companions about the site and the city.
They suggested to their leader that he go to the temple and make offerings,
to inquire of the divinity of the place which land would provide
them a habitation of a fixed abode; and when he'd gotten the assent of all,
Brutus took the augur Gerio and twelve elders up with him
and made for the temple with everthing that was needed for a sacrifice.


Quo ubi uentum est, circundati timpora uittis ante aditum ueterrimo ritu tribus diis,
Ioui uidelicet et Mercurio nec non et Dianae, tres focos statuerunt;
singulis singula libamina dederunt.
Ipse Brutus ante aram deae,
uas sacrificii plenum uino et sanguine candidae ceruae dextra tenens,
erecto uultu ad effigiem numinis silentium in haec uerba dissoluit:

'Diua potens nemorum, terror siluestribus apris,
  cui licet amfractus ire per aethereos
 infernasque domos, terrestria iura reuolue
  et dic quas terras nos habitare uelis.
 Dic certam sedem qua te uenerabor in aeuum,
  qua tibi uirgineis templa dicabo choris".

Haec ubi nouies dixit, circuiuit aram quater fuditque uinum quod tenebat 300
in foco atque procubuit super pellem ceruae, quam ante aram extenderat,
inuitatoque sompno tandem obdormiuit. 

And when they got there they bound fillets round their temples
and set up, before the entrance in an ancient rite, three braziers
to three gods, Jove, naturally, and Mercury and not least Diana;
and bestowed a drink-offering on each one.
Brutus himself stood before the altar of the goddess,
holding in his right hand a sacrificial vessel filled with wine
and the blood of a white hind, lifted his face to the image of the divinity
and broke the silence with these words:

'Powerful goddess of the forests, terror of the woodland boars,
  who may make a circuit through celestial
 and infernal houses, unwind earthly laws
  and tell which lands you wish us to dwell in.
 Declare a settled home where I will do homage to you for all time,
  where I will consecrate temples to you with choirs of maidens.'

When he'd said this nine times, he circled the altar four times
and poured the wine that he was carrying into the brazier
and sank down upon the skin of a hind that he'd laid out before the altar.
There he sought sleep, and finally drifted off.

=================================================
Erat tunc quasi tercia hora noctis,
qua dulciore sopore mortales premuntur. Tunc uisum est illi deam astare
ante ipsum et sese in hunc modum affari:

"Brute, sub occasu solis trans Gallica regna
  insula in occeano est undique clausa mari;
 insula in occeano est habitata gigantibus olim,
  nunc deserta quidem, gentibus apta tuis.
 Hanc pete; namque tibi sedes erit illa perhennis.
  Hic fiet natis altera Troia tuis. 310
 Hic de prole tua reges nascentur, et ipsis
  tocius terrae subditus orbis erit".

Tali uisione expergefactus dux in dubio mansit an sompnus fuerat
quem uidit an dea uiua uoce praedixerat patriam quam aditurus erat.
Vocatis tandem sociis, indicauit per ordinem quod sibi dormienti contigerat.
At illi, maximo gaudio fluctuantes,
hortantur ut ad naues repedent et dum uentus secundus esset
citissimis uelis uersus occasum eant ad inquirendum quod diua spoponderat.
=================================================
It was then about the third hour of the night,
when mortal men are overwhelmed by sweet slumber.
Then it seemed to him that the goddess stood before him
and addressed him in this way:

"Brutus, near where the sun sets, beyond the kingdoms of the Gauls,
  there is an island in the ocean completely surrounded by the sea;
 an island in the ocean that once was inhabited by giants,
  but now, indeed, is deserted, that is suitable for your people.
 Make for it; for it will be your everlasting home.
  Here another Troy will be created for your children.
 Here kings will be born from your offspring, and
  the whole earth will be subdued by them."

After he woke from such a vision the leader remained in doubt as to
whether it had been a dream that he saw,
or whether the goddess with her actual voice had foretold his homeland
that he was going to visit.
After some time, he summoned his companions
and revealed, point by point, what had happened to him while he slept.
And they, swelling with great joy,
urged that they return to their ships and head towards the west 
with their swiftest sails as soon as the wind was favorable,
to search for what the goddess had promised.
=================================================
Nec mora, remeant ad socios altumque ingrediuntur.
Sulcantes aequora, cursu triginta dierum uenerunt ad Affricam,
nescii adhuc quorsum proras uerterent.
Deinde uenerunt ad aras Philistinorum et
ad lacum Salinarum et nauigauerunt inter Russicadam et montes Azarae.
Ibi ab incursione piratarum maximum passi sunt periculum;
uictoriam tamen adepti, spoliis eorum et rapinis ditati sunt.

Porro, flumen Maluae transeuntes, applicuerunt in Mauritaniam.
Deinde, penuria cibi et potus coacti, egressi sunt ex nauibus
et dispositis turmis uastauerunt patriam a fine usque ad finem.
Refertis uero nauibus, petierunt columpnas Herculis,
ubi apparuerunt eis monstra maris uocata Sirenes,
quae ambiendo naues fere ipsas obruerunt;
utcumque tamen elapsi, uenerunt ad Tyrrenum aequor.
Ibi iuxta littora inuenerunt quatuor generationes de exulibus Troiae ortas quae Antenoris fugam comitatae erant.
=================================================
They returned to their companions without delay and launched into the deep.
Plowing through the sea, in the course of thirty days they came to Africa,
without as yet knowing which way they should steer their prows.
Then they came to the altars of the Philistines and the Salt Lake
and sailed between Russicada and the Azara Mountains.
There they endured great peril from an attack of pirates;
yet they gained the victory, and were enriched with their spoils.

After that they passed the river of Malva and landed in Mauritania.
Then, compelled by a want of food and water, they disembarked,
sent out a squadon and laid waste to the countryside, from end to end.
With their ships crammed full, they made for the Pillars of Hercules,
where they saw the sea monsters called the Sirens,
who surrounded their ships and nearly stove them in;
nevertheless they escaped and came to the Tyrrhenian Sea.
There near the shores they discovered four generations descended from exiles
from Troy who had followed Antenor in flight.
=================================================

Erat eorum dux Corineus dictus, uir modestus, consilii optimus, magnae uirtutis et audaciae;
qui si cum aliquo gigante congressum faceret, ilico obruebat eum ac si cum puero contenderet.
Agnita itaque ueteris originis prosapia, associauerunt illum sibi nec non et populum cui praesidebat.
Hic, de nomine ducis postmodum Cornubiensis uocatus, Bruto in omni decertatione prae ceteris auxilium praestabat.
Deinde uenerunt ad Aequitaniam et hostium Ligeris ingressi anchoras fixerunt.
Morati sunt ibi septem diebus situmque regni explorauerunt.

Regnabat tunc in Aequitania Goffarius Pictus, eiusdem patriae rex;
cui ut fama indicauit externam gentem cum magna classe in fines regni sui applicuisse,
misit legatos ad inquirendum utrum pacem uel guerram aduectasset.
Nuncii ergo classem petentes obuiauerunt Corineo,
egresso iam cum ducentis uiris ut infra nemora uenationem adquireret.
=================================================
Their leader was called Corineus, a reserved man,
the best man for advice, great strength and daring;
and if he were to get in a fight with some giant,
he'd straightway overwhelm him, as if contending with a boy.
And so, after recognizing their ancient shared lineage,
the Trojans joined with him and also with the people that he protected.
These people, later called Cornish after the name of their leader,
aided Brutus more than the others in every fight.
Then they came to the Aquitane and, advancing to the mouth
of the Loire, they dropped anchor.
They stayed there seven days and explored the situation of the kingdom.

Goffary the Pict, the king of that country, was ruling then in the Aquitane.
News was brought to him that a foreign nation with a great fleet had landed
within the borders of his kingdom, and he sent envoys to inquire whether
it had brought peace or war.
And so the messengers who were making for the fleet met Corineus,
who had already advanced with the forward guard to hunt in the forest.
=================================================

Mox allocuti eum quaerunt cuius licentia saltus regis ingressus feras necaret;
statutum enim ab antiquo fuerat neminem sine principis iussu debere prosternere.
Quibus cum Corineus respondisset licentiam huius rei nequaquam debere haberi,
irruit unus ex illis, Imbertus nomine, et curuato arcu sagittam in ipsum direxit.
Vitauit eam Corineus cucurritque ocius in Imbertum et arcu
quem tenebat caput ei in frusta contriuit.
Diffugierunt ergo ceteri, uix ex manibus eius elapsi,
atque Goffario necem socii nuntiauerunt.
Contristatus ilico dux Pictauensium collegit exercitum grandem
ut in ipsos mortem nuntii sui uindicaret.
At Brutus, diuulgato eius aduentu, naues munit,
mulieres et paruulos infra ipsas iubet manere,
ipse cum tota multitudine cui uigor florebat obuius exercitui progreditur.
=================================================
They immediatley spoke to him, asking who had given him permission to
enter the king's forest and kill the wild beasts;
for from old custom it had been settled that nobody
should strike them without the prince's command.
And when Corineus responded that no-one should need the king's permission,
one of them, called Imbertus, dashed up and drew his bow and loosed an
arrow at him. 
Corineus dodged the arrow and charged Imbertus and
beat his head to shreds with the bow that he was holding.
And so the others scattered, barely escaping his hands,
and brought Goffary word of the murder of their companion.
Saddened, the leader of the Picts immediately mustered his full army
in order to avenge the death of his messenger.
But Brutus, on news of their coming, fortified the ships and
ordered the women and little ones to stay on them,
while he himself marched out to meet the opposing army with a whole crowd,
flourishing with vigor.
=================================================

Inito tandem certamine, dira pugna utrobique committitur;
et cum multum diei in agendo caedem consumpsissent,
puduit Corineum Aequitanos tam audacter resistere nec Troianos cum triumpho insistere.
Vnde resumpta audatia seuocauit suos in dexteram partem proelii
et facto agmine celerem impetum in hostes fecit;
et ut infra eorundem turmas sese densa acie intromisit,
non cessauit hostes prosternere donec penetrata cohorte cunctos in fugam coegit.
Fortuna ei amisso gladio bipennem amministrauerat,
cum qua quemcumque attingebat a summo usque ad imum disiungebat.
Miratur Brutus, mirantur socii, mirantur etiam hostes audaciam uiri et uirtutem.
Qui bipennem inter fugientes cohortes librans timorem non minimum cum his uerbis
inferebat:
=================================================
At length combat was joined, and both sides engaged in a dreadful battle;
and after they'd used up a most of the day in slaughtering each other,
Corineus was ashamed that the Aquitanes were resisting so boldly,
and that the Trojans didn't press on with a victory.
But when he'd recovered his confidence he called his men over to the right wing
of the battle, formed a line and made a swift attack upon the enemy;
and as he attacked those same troops with a solid front,
he didn't leave off striking down the enemy until he'd forced every man
in the cohort that he'd breached into flight.
After losing his sword he chanced upon a double-edged battle ax,
with which he split anyone that he came upon from head to toe.
Brutus marvelled, his companions marvelled, even the enemy marvelled at the
boldness and courage of the man.
And even as he swung his battle ax among the fleeing cohorts,
he brought on no less fear with his words:
=================================================

'Quo fugitis timidi, quo fugitis segnes? Reuertimini, o reuertimini
 et congressum cum Corineo facite. Proh pudor! Tot milia me solum
 diffugitis? At tamen habetote solatium fugae uestrae quod ego uos
 insequor, qui tociens soleo Tyrrenos gigantes in fugam propellere, qui
 ternos atque quaternos ad Tartara detrudere'.

Ad haec uerba illius reuertitur quidam consul, uocabulo Suhardus,
cum trecentis militibus et impetum fecit in eum.
Cuius ictum Corineus praetenso clipeo excipiens non oblitus est bipennis quam
tenebat sed erecta illa percussit eum in summitatem galeae percussumque a summo
usque ad imum in ambas partes dissecuit.
Sed et confestim irruens in ceteros bipennem rotat, stragem acerrimam facit,
et nunc hac nunc illac discurrens
nec ictus recipere diffugit nec hostes prosternere quiescit.
Huic brachium cum manu amputat, illi scapulas a corpore separat,
alii caput uno ictu truncat, alteri crura a summo dissecat.
=================================================
 'Where are you running off to, cowards? Where are you fleeing to, sluggards?
  Come back here, come back and do battle with Corineus.  For shame!
  So many thousands scattered by only me?
  But still, take comfort in your flight, because it's me who pursues you,
  I who so often was wont to force Tyrrhenian giants into flight,
  who drove them to the Underworld three or four at a time.'

At these words of his a certain magistrate, called Suhardus, turned around
and charged him, along with three hundred soldiers.
But Corineus warded off his stroke with his shield, held out before him.
And, not forgetting the battle ax that he was holding,
he raised it and struck him on the top of his helmet and the blow
split him in two, from head to toe.
And at once rushing at the others whirling his battle ax,
he performed a most bitter slaughter, dashing about, now here, now there,
he neither fended blows off nor rested in laying the enemy low.
He lopped off this one's arm and hand, separated that one's shoulders from his
body, cut off another's head with a single blow, sliced the next one's legs off.
=================================================

Omnes in illum solum et ipse solus in omnes irruebat.
Quod Brutus aspiciens, motus amore uiri,
cucurrit cum una turma ut ei auxilium subuectaret.
Tunc oritur clamor inter diuersas gentes, tunc crebri ictus inferuntur,
tunc in utraque parte fit caedes dirissima.
Nec mora, uictoria potiuntur Troes et regem Goffarium cum Pictauensibus suis in fugam propellunt.
Qui uix euadens partes Galliarum adiuit ut a cognatis et notis succursum haberet.
Erant tunc temporis duodecim reges in Gallia,
quorum regimine tota patria pari dignitate regebatur;
qui benigne suscipientes eum promittunt sese unanimiter expulsuros ex finibus Aequitaniae externam gentem quae aduenerat. 

At Brutus, ob praedictam uictoriam laetus, peremptorum spoliis socios ditat,
ditatos autem iterum in turmas resociat, resociatos per patriam ducit,
affectans eam penitus desolare et naues suas uniuersis diuiciis replere.
Accumulato igitur igne, ciuitates undique incendit,
absconditas quoque opes ab eisdem extrahit, agros etiam depopulat,
stragem miserandam ciuibus atque plebanis infert,
uolens infelicem gentem usque ad unum delere.
=================================================
They all ganged up on that man and he fought back on his own.
When Brutus observed this he, moved with love for the man,
raced up with a single troop to lend him aid.
Then a battle-cry rose up among the different tribes,
then constant blows rained down, 
then a dreadful slaughter fell on both sides.
And without delay, the Trojans gained a victory and drove King Goffary to
flight, together with his Poitevins.
Escaping by the skin of his teeth,
he went to other parts of Gaul to get help from friends and relatives.
At that time there were twelve kings in Gaul
who ruled the whole country with equal standing;
they accepted him courteously and promised that they would, to a man,
drive the freshly arrived foreign tribe out of the country of Aquitaine.

Now Brutus, joyful on account of the aforesaid victory,
enriched his companions with the spoils of those who had been killed,
and joined the enriched men up again into troops,
and led the joined-up men across the country,
wanting to utterly despoil it and to fill up his ships with all its riches.
And so he gathered up fire and burnt down the cities on every side,
extracting the wealth hidden in them, also laid waste to the fields,
and brought about a miserable massacre among the citizens and commoners,
wanting to annihilate the wretched people to the last man.
=================================================

Ac dum tali clade totius fere Aequitaniae partes affecisset,
uenit ad locum ubi nunc est ciuitas Turonorum,
quam ut Omerus testatur ipse postmodum construxit.
Vt igitur loca conuenientia refugio inspexit,
metatus est ibi castra sua ut si opus accidisset sese infra ipsa reciperet.
Vrgebatur namque timore propter aduentum Goffarii,
qui cum regibus et principibus Galliae et maxima armatorum copia prope eundem locum aduenerat ut cum illo bellum committeret.
Peractis deinde castris, expectauit ibi biduo Goffarium,
confidens in prudentia sua atque audatia iuuentutis cui praesidebat.

Goffarius ergo, audita ibidem praesentia Troianorum, nec noctu nec
die cessauit incedere donec castra Bruti prope aspexit.
Toruo igitur lumine intuens, paulisper subridens in haec uerba erupit:

      Proh fatum triste!
      Castra etiam sua in regno meo fecerunt ignobiles exules.
      Armate uos, uiri, armate et per densatas turmas incedite.
      Nulla mora erit quin semimares istos uelut oues capiemus
      atque captos per regna nostra mancipabimus'.
=================================================
And after inflicting such carnage on nearly all of Aquitaine,
he came to the place where the city of Tours now stands
(which he himself later built, as Homer attests).
As he consequently considered the place appropriate for a refuge,
he laid out his camp there, so he could withdraw into it, if the need arose.
Indeed, he was spurred by a fear of Goffary's coming, as he was nearby,
with kings and princes of Gaul and a huge number of armed men,
in order to engage in war with him.
After the camp was completed, he waited there for Goffary for two days,
confident in his prudence and the daring of the youths that he commanded.

Now when Goffary heard that the Trojans were at that very place, he didn't rest,
advancing day and night, until he came within sight of Brutus' camp.
And so, gazing with a pitiless eye and a brusque smile,
he burst out with these words:

   Oh sorrowful fate!
   The ignoble exiles have made their camp in my own kingdom.
   Arm yourselves, men, arm and advance in close formation.
   In no time at all we'll round up those pansies like sheep,
   and sell the captives throughout our kingdom.
=================================================

Armauerunt itaque se omnes quos secum adduxerat
et per duodena agmina statuti uersus hostes suos incedunt.
Contra quos Brutus etiam dispositis cateruis non muliebriter graditur
sed turmas suas quid acturae essent sapienter docens qualiter debeant
et inuadere et resistere edicit.
Vt ergo congressum inceperunt,
praeualuerunt in initio Troes et caedem acerrimam ex hostibus faciunt.
Ceciderunt namque ex eis fere duo milia hominum;
unde ceteri stupefacti fere in fugam uersi fuerunt.
Sed ubi maior numerus hominum habundat, euenire solet triumphum accedere.
Galli igitur, quoniam tricies plures erant ceteris,
quamquam primo oppressi fuerant,
tandem tamen resociati impetum fecerunt undique in Troas et illata strage
ipsos castra ingredi coegerunt.

Victoriam itaque adepti, obsederunt eos infra castra,
meditantes se nequaquam prius illinc abscedere antequam ipsi inclusi
uel colla uincienda catenis traderent
uel longa fame afflicti saeuissima morte tormentarentur.
=================================================
And so everyone that he'd brought armed themselves and,
formed into twelve columns, advanced towards their enemy.
And likewise Brutus stationed men to face them and advanced,
not in a womanly fashion, but wisely instructing his troops
what was to be done and instructing them what should be done
when he told them to attack or stand firm.
Then the battle was joined.
In the beginning the Trojans prevailed and made a bitter slaughter of the enemy,
mowing down nearly two thousand of their men;
From this the rest, in stupification, nearly turned and fled.
But when one side has a greater number of men, that side tends to be victorious.
And so even though the Gauls had been overwhelmed at first,
because there were thirty times as many of them,
they were still able to reform and attack the Trojans from all sides and,
throwing them into confusion, forced them back into their camp.

And so, having gained the victory, they blocked them up within their camp,
thinking that they wouldn't on any account leave there until those shut up
either surrendered their necks to be bound in chains
or, afflicted with long lasting hunger, were tormented with a cruel death.
=================================================

Sequenti interea nocte Corineus iniuit consilium cum Bruto:
se uelle scilicet per quaedam diuorcia in eadem nocte egredi
et infra nemus quod prope fuerat usque ad diem delitere;
et dum Brutus cum diluculo egressus cum hostibus dimicaret,
ipse cum cohorte sua a dorso superueniret et facto impetu stragem ingereret.
Placuit itaque Bruto sententia Corinei;
qui ut praedixerat callide egressus est cum tribus milibus occultaque nemorum petiuit.
Adueniente autem postera die,
statuit Brutus suos per turmas et apertis castris pugnaturus egreditur.
Occurrunt igitur confestim Galli et facto agmine cum ipso congrediuntur.
Concidunt ilico in utraque parte multa milia uirorum dum mutua uulnera dantur,
quia nullus aduersario suo parcebat.
Erat ibi quidam Tros nomine Turnus, Bruti nepos,
quo forcior siue audatior nullus excepto Corineo aderat.
=================================================
In the meantime, Corineus formed a plan with Brutus the next night:
he would leave camp on a sideroad that very night to hide among
the nearby woods until day;
and when Brutus marched out at dawn to do battle with enemy,
he himself would come up from behind with his cohort to attack
and slaughter them.
And so Corineus' way of thinking pleased Brutus;
and as he had proposed he snuck out with three thousand men and
made for hiding places in the woods.
Now when the next day came, Brutus marshalled his men,
threw the gates open and marched out to fight.
And so the Gauls at once rushed in and formed up and joined battle with him.
Many thousands soon fell as wounds were inflicted on both sides,
since no-one was sparing of his adversary.
Brutus' nephew, a Trojan named Turnus, was there,
and there was no man stronger or braver than he, save Corineus.
=================================================

Hic solus solo gladio suo sexcentos uiros peremit,
sed ab irruentibus Gallis cicius quam debuisset interfectus est.
De nomine ipsius praedicta ciuitas Turonis uocabulum nacta est,
quia ibidem sepultus fuit.
Cum igitur utraeque turmae acrius pugnarent,
superuenit ex inprouiso Corineus et a tergo hostes celeriter inuasit.
Audatiores proinde insurgentes ceteri ex altera parte incumbunt
stragemque facere contendunt.
=================================================
He himself killed six-hundred men with only his sword,
but was killed by the attacking Gauls all too soon.
From his own name the aforementioned city of Tours got its name,
because he was buried in that very place.
And so while both sides fought on fiercely,
Corineus arrived from out of nowhere and at once attacked the enemy from behind.
Then the rest rose up more boldly and attacked from the other side,
striving for a slaughter.
=================================================

Itaque Galli solo clamore Corineiensium, qui a tergo inuaserant, stupefacti sunt
et arbitrantes plures aduenisse quam aduenerant campum deserere festinant.
Quos Troes usque ferientes insequuntur, insequendo uero prosternunt,
nec prosternere cessauerunt donec uictoriam habuerunt.
Brutus itaque, licet tantus triumphus illi maximum intulisset gaudium,
dolore tamen angebatur quia numerus suorum cotidie minuebatur,
Gallorum autem semper multiplicabatur.
In dubio tandem existens utrum diutius eos oppugnaret,
praeelegit naues suas salua adhuc maiori parte sociorum
nec non et reuerentia uictoriae adire atque
insulam quam ei diuinus praedixerat monitus exigere.
=================================================
And so the Gauls, stupified by the mere war-cries of Corineus' men,
who had attacked them from behind, and thinking that more had arrived than
truly had, hastened to quit the field.
And the Trojans pursued them, slaying them at every point
and bowling them over in the pursuit,
and didn't let up until they gained the day.
And so, even though such a triumph had brought Brutus great delight,
he was nevertheless troubled because his own numbers were falling daily,
while those of the Gauls steadily increased.
In the end, in doubt whether or not to press the attack,
he chose to return to his ships, while the larger part of his companions,
and the regard for his victory, were intact,
and to push on to the island that the divine prophecy had foretold to him.
=================================================

Nec plura, petiuit suorum assensu classem suam
et repleuit eam ex uniuersis diuiciis quas acquisiuerat et ipsam ingressus est.
Prosperis quoque uentis promissam insulam exigens, in Totonesio littore applicuit.
Erat tunc nomen insulae Albion; quae a nemine,
exceptis paucis gigantibus, inhabitabatur.
Amoeno tamen situ locorum et copia piscosorum fluminum nemoribusque praeelecta,
affectum habitandi Bruto sociisque inferebat.
Peragratis ergo quibusque prouinciis,
repertos gigantes ad cauernas montium fugant,
patriam donante duce sorciuntur, agros incipiunt colere, domos aedificare,
ita ut in breui tempore terram ab aeuo inhabitatam censeres.
Denique Brutus de nomine suo insulam Britanniam appellat sociosque suos Britones.
=================================================
And in short, he headed for his fleet with the assent of his men
and loaded all the riches that he'd gained into it and got onboard.
Driven by favorable winds to the promised island, he made landfall at Totnes.
At that time the name of the island was Albion;
it had no inhabitants, save for a few giants.
Yet, with an excellent location and plenty of fish-filled rivers and forests,
it led Brutus and his comrades to want to dwell there.
And so, after travelling through each of the provinces
and chasing any giants that they found off to caves in the mountains,
they divided the land, with their leader's blessing,
and began to till fields and build houses, so that in a short time
you'd have thought that the land had been inhabited for generations.
In the end Brutus called the island Britain, from his own name,
and his companions Britons.
=================================================

Volebat enim ex diriuatione nominis memoriam habere perpetuam.
Vnde postmodum loquela gentis,
quae prius Troiana siue curuum Graecum nuncupabatur, dicta fuit Britannica.
At Corineus portionem regni quae sorti suae cesserat ab appellatione etiam sui
nominis Corineiam uocat,
populum quoque suum Corineiensem, exemplum ducis insecutus.
Qui cum prae omnibus qui aduenerant electionem prouinciarum posset habere,
maluit regionem illam quae nunc uel a cornu Britanniae
uel per corruptionem praedicti nominis Cornubia appellatur.
Delectabat enim eum contra gigantes dimicare,
quorum copia plus ibidem habundabat quam in ulla prouinciarum
quae consociis suis distributae fuerant.
Erat ibi inter ceteros detestabilis quidam nomine Goemagog,
staturae duodecim cubitorum, 
qui tantae uirtutis existens quercum semel excussam uelut uirgulam corili euellebat.
=================================================
For he wanted to have, from this derivation, everlasting memory of his name.
From this his people's speech, which had earlier been called Trojan,
or crooked Greek, was afterwards called British.
Now Corineus named the share of the kingdom that fell to his lot Corineia,
also from his own name, and his people likewise Cornish,
following his leader's example.
And since he had first pick of the provinces,
he chose the region which is now called Cornwall,
either from the horn of Britain or through a corruption of the aforesaid name.
For it delighted him to do battle with giants,
and there were more of them in that place than in any of the provinces
that had been assigned to his companions.
There was, among other detestibles, one named Goemagog,
twelve cubits in height, proving to be so strong that he would pull out
an oak-tree as if it were a sprig of primrose.



Hic quadam die,
dum Brutus in portu quo applicuerat festiuum diem deis celebraret,
superuenit cum uiginti gigantibus atque dirissima caede Britones affecit.
At Britones, undique tandem confluentes, praeualuerunt
in eos et omnes praeter Goemagog interfecerunt. Hunc Brutus uiuum 475
reseruari praeceperat, uolens uidere luctationem ipsius et Corinei, qui cum
talibus congredi ultra modum aestuabat. Itaque Corineus, maximo gaudio
fluctuans, succinxit se et abiectis armis ipsum ad luctandum
uocat.

Hic quadam die, dum Brutus in portu quo applicuerat festiuum diem deis celebraret, superuenit cum uiginti gigantibus atque dirissima caede Britones affecit. At Britones, undique tandem confluentes, praeualuerunt in eos et omnes praeter Goemagog interfecerunt.

Itaque Corineus, maximo gaudio fluctuans, succinxit se et abiectis armis ipsum ad luctandum prouocat. Inito deinde certamine, instat Corineus, instat gigas, et alter alterum uinculis brachiorum adnectens crebris afflatibus aera uexant. Nec mora, Goemagog, Corineum maximis uiribus astringens, fregit ei tres costas, duas in dextro latere, unam uero in sinistro. Vnde Corineus compulsus in iram reuocauit uires suas et imposuit illum humeris suis et quantum uelocitas pro pondere sinebat ad proxima littora cucurrit. Deinde, summitatem excelsae rupis nactus, excussit se et praedictum letabile monstrum, quod super humeros suos ferebat, infra mare proiecit. At ille, per abrupta saxorum cadens, in mille frusta dilaceratus est et fluctus sanguine maculauit. Locus autem ille, nomen ex praecipitatione gigantis adeptus, Saltus Goemagog usque in
