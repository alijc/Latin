LIBER I

Aeneas post Troianum bellum excidium urbis cum Ascanio filio diffugiens Italiam nauigio adiuit.
Ibi cum a Latino rege honorifice receptus esset,
inuidit Turnus rex Rutulorum et cum illo congressus est.
Dimicantibus ergo illis,
praeualuit Aeneas peremptoque Turno regnum Italiae et Lauiniam filiam Latini adeptus est.
Denique, suprema die ipsius superueniente, Ascanius,
regia potestate sublimatus,
condidit Albam super Tyberim genuitque filium cui nomen erat Siluius.
Hic, furtiuae ueneri indulgens, nupsit cuidam nepti Lauiniae eamque fecit praegnantem.
Cumque id Ascanio patri compertum esset,
praecepit magis suis explorare quem sexum puella concepisset.

BOOK I

After the Trojan War, Aeneas fled the destruction of his city with his son
Ascanius, and came to Italy by ship.
There, after he was received with honor by King Latinus,
Turnus, the king of the Rutulians, grew jealous of him and engaged him in battle.
Therefore in fighting these men,
Aeneas prevailed, killed Turnus, and won the kingdom of Italy and Lavinia,
the daughter of Latinus.
In the end, when the day of Aeneas' funeral rites came, Ascanius, elevated to royal power,
founded Alba on the Tiber and had a son, named Silvius.
This man was partial to furtive venery, and
married a granddaughter of Lavinia and got her pregnant.
And when this was discovered by his father Ascanius,
he ordered his wise men to ascertain the gender of the child that the girl had conceived.

Certitudine ergo rei comperta,
dixerunt magi ipsam grauidam esse puero qui patrem et matrem interficeret,
pluribus quoque terris in exilium peragratis ad summum tandem culmen honoris perueniret.
Nec fefellit eos uaticinium suum.
Nam ut dies partus accessit, edidit mulier puerum et in natiuitate eius mortua est;
traditur autem ille obstetrici et uocatur Brutus.
Postremo, cum ter quini anni emensi essent,
comitabatur iuuenis patrem in uenando ipsumque inopino ictu sagittae interfecit;
nam dum famuli ceruos in occursum eorum ducerent, Brutus,
telum in ipsos dirigere affectans, genitorem sub pectore percussit.
Quo mortuo, expulsus est ab Italia,
indignantibus parentibus ipsum tantum facinus fecisse.
Exulatus ergo adiuit partes Graeciae et inuenit progeniem Heleni filii Priami,
quae sub potestate Pandrasi regis Graecorum in seruitutem tenebatur;
Pirrus etenim filius Achillis post euersionem Troiae
praedictum Helenum compluresque alios secum in uinclis abduxerat et
ut necem patris sui in ipsos uindicaret in captionem teneri praeceperat.

And so, when they were sure, 
the wise men said that she was pregnant with a boy who would kill his father and mother,
and would also travel to and fro over many lands in exile
before finally achieving the utmost peak of honor.
And their prophesy did not deceive them.
For when the day of the birth arrived, the woman bore a boy and died in birthing him;
but he was handed to a midwife and named Brutus.
Finally, after thrice five years had passed,
the youth goes hunting with his father and kills him with a wayward arrow;
for while the servants were driving the deer towards their encounter, Brutus,
in directing his shaft into them, pierced his progenitor under the breast.
And, after his father died, he was banished from Italy,
with his grandparents despising him for having committed so great a crime.
And so, the exile visited regions of Greece and discovered the descendents of Helenus, the son
of Priam,
that were being held in servitude under the reign of Pandrasus, the king of the Greeks;
indeed, after the destruction of Troy, Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles,
had carried off the aforementioned Helenus in chains, along with many others,
and had ordered them to be held in captivity, to avenge his father's slaughter.


Agnita igitur ueterum conciuium prosapia, moratus est Brutus apud eos.
In tantum autem militia et probitate uigere coepit ita
ut a regibus et principibus prae omni iuuentute patriae amaretur;
erat enim inter sapientes sapiens, inter bellicosos bellicosus,
et quicquid auri uel argenti siue ornamentorum adquirebat totum militibus erogabat.
Diuulgata itaque per uniuersas nationes ipsius fama,
Troiani coeperunt ad eum confluere,
orantes ut ipso duce a seruitute Graecorum liberarentur,
quod leuiter fieri asserebant,
cum in tantum iam infra patriam multiplicati essent ita ut septem milia,
exceptis paruulis et mulieribus, computarentur.
Praeterea erat quidam nobilissimus iuuenis in Graecia nomine Assaracus
qui partibus eorum fauebat.
Ex Troiana namque matre natus erat fiduciamque in illis habebat maximam
ut auxilio eorum inquietudini Graecorum resistere quiuisset.
Arguebat enim eum frater suus propter tria castella
quae sibi moriens pater donauerat
et ea auferre conabatur quia ex concubina natus fuerat.
Erat autem frater patre et matre Graecus
asciueratque regem ceterosque Graecos parti suae fauere.
Inspiciens ergo Brutus et uirorum multitudinem
et Assaraci castella quae sibi patebant,
securius petitioni illorum adquieuit.

And so, after recognizing the lineage of his ancient fellow-citizens, Brutus stayed on with them.
Now he commenced to thrive so much in courage and honesty 
that he was loved by kings and princes before every father's son;
for he was wise among wise men, warlike among warlike ones,
and whatever gold or silver or jewels he obtained he paid it all out to his soldiers.
And so as his fame spread through all the nations, the Trojans began to flock to him,
begging that he lead them and liberate them from the servitude of the Greeks,
which they declared would be easily done,
since after leaving their native land they had already multiplied so much
that they were reckoned at seven thousand, other than women and children.

In addition, there was a certain most noble youth in Greece, Assaracus by name,
who favored his parts.
For he'd been born of a Trojan mother and in those he had the greatest courage
so that toby their aid to disquiet of the Greeks to resist he had been able.
For his brother argued him on account of three castles
which to self dying father had granted
and the things to bear he tried because out of concubine he had been born.
But he was brother toby father and mother a Greek
and adopted king and the other Greeks to favor his part.
And so Brutus inspecting and the multitude of men
and the castles of Assaracus, which to self were standing open,
more secure thing assented to their petition.


Erectus igitur in ducem,
conuocat undique Troianos et oppida Assaraci munit.
Ipse autem et Assaracus cum tota multitudine uirorum et mulierum
