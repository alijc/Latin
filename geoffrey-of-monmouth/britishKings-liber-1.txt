LIBER I

Aeneas post Troianum bellum excidium urbis cum Ascanio filio diffugiens Italiam nauigio adiuit.
Ibi cum a Latino rege honorifice receptus esset,
inuidit Turnus rex Rutulorum et cum illo congressus est.
Dimicantibus ergo illis,
praeualuit Aeneas peremptoque Turno regnum Italiae et Lauiniam filiam Latini adeptus est.
Denique, suprema die ipsius superueniente, Ascanius,
regia potestate sublimatus,
condidit Albam super Tyberim genuitque filium cui nomen erat Siluius.
Hic, furtiuae ueneri indulgens, nupsit cuidam nepti Lauiniae eamque fecit praegnantem.
Cumque id Ascanio patri compertum esset,
praecepit magis suis explorare quem sexum puella concepisset.

BOOK I

After the Trojan War, Aeneas fled the destruction of his city with his son
Ascanius, and came to Italy by ship.
There, after he was received with honor by King Latinus,
Turnus, the king of the Rutulians, grew jealous of him and engaged him in battle.
Therefore in fighting these men,
Aeneas prevailed, killed Turnus, and won the kingdom of Italy and Lavinia,
the daughter of Latinus.
In the end, when the day of Aeneas' funeral rites came, Ascanius, elevated to royal power,
founded Alba on the Tiber and had a son, named Silvius.
This man was partial to furtive venery, and
married a granddaughter of Lavinia and got her pregnant.
And when this was discovered by his father Ascanius,
he ordered his wise men to ascertain the gender of the child that the girl had conceived.


Certitudine ergo rei comperta,
dixerunt magi ipsam grauidam esse puero qui patrem et matrem interficeret,
pluribus quoque terris in exilium peragratis ad summum tandem culmen honoris perueniret.
Nec fefellit eos uaticinium suum.
Nam ut dies partus accessit, edidit mulier puerum et in natiuitate eius mortua est;
traditur autem ille obstetrici et uocatur Brutus.
Postremo, cum ter quini anni emensi essent,
comitabatur iuuenis patrem in uenando ipsumque inopino ictu sagittae interfecit;
nam dum famuli ceruos in occursum eorum ducerent, Brutus,
telum in ipsos dirigere affectans, genitorem sub pectore percussit.
Quo mortuo, expulsus est ab Italia,
indignantibus parentibus ipsum tantum facinus fecisse.
Exulatus ergo adiuit partes Graeciae et inuenit progeniem Heleni filii Priami,
quae sub potestate Pandrasi regis Graecorum in seruitutem tenebatur;
Pirrus etenim filius Achillis post euersionem Troiae
praedictum Helenum compluresque alios secum in uinclis abduxerat et
ut necem patris sui in ipsos uindicaret in captionem teneri praeceperat.

And so, when they were sure, 
the wise men said that she was pregnant with a boy who would kill his father and mother,
and would also travel to and fro over many lands in exile
before finally achieving the utmost peak of honor.
And their prophesy did not deceive them.
For when the day of the birth arrived, the woman bore a boy and died in birthing him;
but he was handed to a midwife and named Brutus.
Finally, after thrice five years had passed,
the youth goes hunting with his father and kills him with a wayward arrow;
for while the servants were driving the deer towards their encounter, Brutus,
in directing his shaft into them, pierced his progenitor under the breast.
And, after his father died, he was banished from Italy,
with his grandparents despising him for having committed so great a crime.
And so, the exile visited regions of Greece and discovered the descendents of Helenus, the son
of Priam,
that were being held in servitude under the reign of Pandrasus, the king of the Greeks;
indeed, after the destruction of Troy, Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles,
had carried off the aforementioned Helenus in chains, along with many others,
and had ordered them to be held in captivity, to avenge his father's slaughter.

Agnita 
igitur ueterum conciuium prosapia, moratus est Brutus apud eos. In tantum
autem militia et probitate uigere coepit ita ut a regibus et principibus prae
omni iuuentute patriae amaretur; erat enim inter sapientes sapiens, inter
bellicosos bellicosus, et quicquid auri uel argenti siue ornamentorum
adquirebat totum militibus erogabat. Diuulgata itaque per uniuersas
