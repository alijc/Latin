LIBER I

Aeneas post Troianum bellum excidium urbis cum Ascanio filio diffugiens Italiam nauigio adiuit.
Ibi cum a Latino rege honorifice receptus esset,
inuidit Turnus rex Rutulorum et cum illo congressus est.
Dimicantibus ergo illis,
praeualuit Aeneas peremptoque Turno regnum Italiae et Lauiniam filiam Latini adeptus est.
Denique, suprema die ipsius superueniente, Ascanius,
regia potestate sublimatus,
condidit Albam super Tyberim genuitque filium cui nomen erat Siluius.
Hic, furtiuae ueneri indulgens, nupsit cuidam nepti Lauiniae eamque fecit praegnantem.
Cumque id Ascanio patri compertum esset,
praecepit magis suis explorare quem sexum puella concepisset.

BOOK I

After the Trojan War, Aeneas fled the destruction of his city with his son
Ascanius, and came to Italy by ship.
There, after he was received with honor by King Latinus,
Turnus, the king of the Rutulians, grew jealous of him and engaged him in battle.
Therefore in fighting these men,
Aeneas prevailed, killed Turnus, and won the kingdom of Italy and Lavinia,
the daughter of Latinus.
In the end, when the day of Aeneas' funeral rites came, Ascanius, elevated to royal power,
founded Alba on the Tiber and had a son, named Silvius.
This man was partial to furtive venery, and
married a granddaughter of Lavinia and got her pregnant.
And when this was discovered by his father Ascanius,
he ordered his wise men to ascertain the gender of the child that the girl had conceived.

Certitudine ergo rei comperta,
dixerunt magi ipsam grauidam esse puero qui patrem et matrem interficeret,
pluribus quoque terris in exilium peragratis ad summum tandem culmen honoris perueniret.
Nec fefellit eos uaticinium suum.
Nam ut dies partus accessit, edidit mulier puerum et in natiuitate eius mortua est;
traditur autem ille obstetrici et uocatur Brutus.
Postremo, cum ter quini anni emensi essent,
comitabatur iuuenis patrem in uenando ipsumque inopino ictu sagittae interfecit;
nam dum famuli ceruos in occursum eorum ducerent, Brutus,
telum in ipsos dirigere affectans, genitorem sub pectore percussit.
Quo mortuo, expulsus est ab Italia,
indignantibus parentibus ipsum tantum facinus fecisse.
Exulatus ergo adiuit partes Graeciae et inuenit progeniem Heleni filii Priami,
quae sub potestate Pandrasi regis Graecorum in seruitutem tenebatur;
Pirrus etenim filius Achillis post euersionem Troiae
praedictum Helenum compluresque alios secum in uinclis abduxerat et
ut necem patris sui in ipsos uindicaret in captionem teneri praeceperat.

And so, when they were sure, 
the wise men said that she was pregnant with a boy who would kill his father and mother,
and would also travel to and fro over many lands in exile
before finally achieving the utmost peak of honor.
And their prophesy did not deceive them.
For when the day of the birth arrived, the woman bore a boy and died in birthing him;
but he was handed to a midwife and named Brutus.
Finally, after thrice five years had passed,
the youth goes hunting with his father and kills him with a wayward arrow;
for while the servants were driving the deer towards their encounter, Brutus,
in directing his shaft into them, pierced his progenitor under the breast.
And, after his father died, he was banished from Italy,
with his grandparents despising him for having committed so great a crime.
And so, the exile visited regions of Greece and discovered the descendents of Helenus, the son
of Priam,
that were being held in servitude under the reign of Pandrasus, the king of the Greeks;
indeed, after the destruction of Troy, Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles,
had carried off the aforementioned Helenus in chains, along with many others,
and had ordered them to be held in captivity, to avenge his father's slaughter.


Agnita igitur ueterum conciuium prosapia, moratus est Brutus apud eos.
In tantum autem militia et probitate uigere coepit ita
ut a regibus et principibus prae omni iuuentute patriae amaretur;
erat enim inter sapientes sapiens, inter bellicosos bellicosus,
et quicquid auri uel argenti siue ornamentorum adquirebat totum militibus erogabat.
Diuulgata itaque per uniuersas nationes ipsius fama,
Troiani coeperunt ad eum confluere,
orantes ut ipso duce a seruitute Graecorum liberarentur,
quod leuiter fieri asserebant,
cum in tantum iam infra patriam multiplicati essent ita ut septem milia,
exceptis paruulis et mulieribus, computarentur.
Praeterea erat quidam nobilissimus iuuenis in Graecia nomine Assaracus
qui partibus eorum fauebat.
Ex Troiana namque matre natus erat fiduciamque in illis habebat maximam
ut auxilio eorum inquietudini Graecorum resistere quiuisset.
Arguebat enim eum frater suus propter tria castella
quae sibi moriens pater donauerat
et ea auferre conabatur quia ex concubina natus fuerat.
Erat autem frater patre et matre Graecus
asciueratque regem ceterosque Graecos parti suae fauere.
Inspiciens ergo Brutus et uirorum multitudinem
et Assaraci castella quae sibi patebant,
securius petitioni illorum adquieuit.

And so, after recognizing their lineage from his ancient countrymen, Brutus stayed on with them.
And he commenced to thrive so much in courage and honesty 
that he was loved by kings and princes above every youth in the land;
for he was wise among wise men, warlike among warlike ones,
and whatever gold or silver or jewels he obtained he paid it all out to his soldiers.
And so as his fame spread through all the nations, the Trojans began to flock to him,
begging that he lead them and liberate them from the servitude of the Greeks,
which they declared would be easily done,
since after leaving their native land they had already multiplied so much
that they were reckoned at seven thousand, not counting women and children.
In addition, there was a certain noble youth in Greece, Assaracus by name, who favored their faction.
For he'd been born of a Trojan mother and he had the greatest confidence in them,
that he'd be able, with their aid, to resist the disturbances of the Greeks.
For his brother was denouncing him on account of three castles
that their father had granted to him when he died
and his brother was trying to take them because Assaracus had been born out of wedlock.
But the brother was Greek on both sides of the family
and had induced the king and the other Greeks to favor his side.
And so Brutus considered both the multitude of men
and Assaracus' castles, which were open to him,
and confidently acquiesced to their petition.


Erectus igitur in ducem, conuocat undique Troianos et oppida Assaraci munit.
Ipse autem et Assaracus cum tota multitudine uirorum et mulierum
quae eis adhaerebat nemora et colles occupant.
Deinde litteras suas regi in haec uerba direxit:

'Pandraso regi Graecorum Brutus dux reliquiarum Troiae salutem.
Quia indignum fuerat gentem praeclaro genere Dardani ortam aliter in regno tuo
tractari quam serenitas nobilitatis eius expeteret, sese infra abdita nemorum recepit;
praeferebat namque ferino ritu, carnibus uidelicet et herbis,
uitam cum libertate sustentare quam uniuersis deliciis refocillata diutius sub
iugo seruitutis tuae permanere.
Quod si celsitudinem potentiae tuae offendit, non est ei imputandum sed uenia adhibenda,
cum cuiusque captiui communis sit intentio uelle ad pristinam dignitatem redire.
Misericordia igitur super eam motus, amissam libertatem largiri digneris
et saltus nemorum quos ut seruitutem diffugeret occupauit eam habitare permittas.
Sin autem, concede ut ad aliarum terrarum nationes cum licentia tua abscedant'.

And so he was elevated to their leader
and assembled Trojans from all over to fortify Assaracus' towns.
But he himself and Assaracus, along with the whole multitude of men
and the women who were attached to them, occupied the forests and hills.
Then he directed a letter to the king, in these words:

'To Pandrasus, the king of the Greeks,
Brutus the leader of the remnants of the Trojans sends greetings.
Because it was shameful for a people descended from the noble ancestry of
Dardanus to be treated in your kingdom contrary to the way
that the favorable conditions of its nobility would demand,
they have withdrawn into the concealment of the forests;
for they prefer to sustain life like wild beasts, with flesh and herbs,
with liberty than to remain longer under the yoke of your servitude,
even if refreashed by all delicacies.
But if it offends Your Highness, they should not be accused but rather forgiven,
since it is the intention of each public captive to wish to return to their former dignity.
Therefore, moved with sympathy for them, may you deem it worthy to grant them their lost liberty
and permit them to inhabit the glades of the forests that they have seized in order to flee servitude.
But if you cannot do so, grant them leave to depart to peoples of other lands.'


Pandrasus ergo, agnita litterarum sententia,
ultra modum admiratus est ipsos quos in seruitutem tenuerat tanta audacia habundasse
ut ei talia mandata dirigerent.
Conuocato itaque procerum suorum consilio,
exercitum colligere decreuit ut ipsos persequeretur.
Dum autem deserta quibus eos adesse  auctumauerat per oppidum Sparatinum peteret,
egressus est Brutus cum tribus milibus uirorum
ipsumque nichil huiusmodi praemeditatum ex inprouiso inuasit.
Audito namque aduentu ipsius, sese in praedicto oppido praeterita proxima nocte inmiserat
in ipsos inermes et sine ordine ituros inopinam irruptionem faceret.
Impetu itaque facto, inuadunt acriter Troiani et stragem ingerere nituntur.
Porro Graeci confestim stupefacti in omnes partes dilabuntur
et rege suo praecedente fluuium Akalon, qui prope fluebat, transire festinant;
at in transeundo infra uoraginem fluctus periclitantur.
Quos diffugientes Brutus infestat, infestatos uero partim in undis partim super ripam prosternit,
et nunc hac nunc illac discurrens duplicem necem ipsis ingestam esse laetatur.
Quod ut Antigonus frater Pandrasi intuitus est,
ultra modum doluit reuocauitque uagantes socios in turmam
et celeri impetu in saeuientes Troas reuersus est;
malebat namque resistendo interire quam ignauam fugam faciens luteis gurgitibus submergi.

Therefore after Pandrasus learned the contents of the letter,
he was astounded beyond measure that those whom he had held in servitude were
so filled with audacity as to send him such a mandate.
And so he convened a council of his nobles
and resolved to assemble an army to attack them.
But when, on his way to the deserted places where he thought them to be,
he passed the town of Sparatinum, Brutus marched out with three thousand men
and fell upon him without warning.
Indeed, when he heard of their approach the night before,
he had inserted himself in that town in order to launch a surprise attack on them
when they were defenseless and disordered in their advance.
And so when the assault had been made,
the Trojans attacked fiercely and tried to wipe them out.
After that the Greeks were immediately stunned and fled in all directions and,
with their king leading the way, rushed to cross the River Akalon, which flowed nearby;
but in the crossing they were imperiled by a whirlpool.
And Brutus harassed them as they scattered, indeed,
he struck some of them down in the waves and others on the bank,
and racing about now this way and now that,
he rejoiced that a twofold death had been thrust upon them.
When Pandrasus' brother Antigonus saw this,
he suffered beyond measure and called his scattered comrades back into formation
and in a swift charge swung back against the raging Trojans;
indeed he preferred perishing in resistance to making a cowardly flight
and drowning in a muddy whirlpool.

Densa igitur acie incedens,
socios uiriliter resistere hortatur letiferaque tela totis uiribus contorquet.
Sed parum uel minime profecit; nam Troes armis muniti erant, ceteri uero inermes.
Vnde audatiores insistentes caedem miserandam inferebant
nec eos hoc modo infestare quieuerunt donec cunctis fere
interfectis Antigonum et Anacletum eiusdem socium retinuerunt.

Brutus uero, potitus uictoria, oppidum sexcentis militibus muniuit
petiuitque nemorum abdita ubi Troiana plebs praesidium illius expectabat.
At Pandrasus, ob fugam suam fratrisque captionem anxiatus,
nocte illa populum dilapsum resociare uacauit
et cum postera lux redisset obsidere oppidum cum resociato populo progressus est;
arbitrabatur enim Brutum inmisisse se infra ipsum cum Antigono
ceterisque captiuis quos ceperat.
Vt igitur moenibus accessit,
explorato castelli situ distribuit exercitum suum per turmas et per diuersas
partes in circuitu locauit.
Indixit etiam ut alii egressum inclusis abnegarent,
alii cursus fluminum auerterent,
alii crebris arietibus ceterisque machinationibus murorum compagem dissoluerent.
Qui praecepta eius effectibus exequentes omni nisu contendebant
quibus modis obsessos crudelius infestarent.

Superueniente autem nocte, audatiores...

And so, advancing in close formation,
he urged his comrades to resist like men and brandished his deadly weapons with all his might.
But he accomplished little enough;
for while the Trojans were fortified with weapons, the others were unarmed.
Hence the bolder men pressed on and carried out a pitiable slaughter 
and did not rest from harassing them in this way until nearly all of them had been killed.
But they took Antigonus and his comrade Anacletus prisoner.

Indeed, Brutus, having won the victory, fortified the town with six hundred soldiers
and sought out the forests where the Trojan civilians hid, awaiting his protection.
But Pandrasus, anxious for his own flight and his brother's capture,
had time to reunite his scattered people that night
and, when dawn returned, advanced to besiege the town with his allies;
for he believed that Brutus had shut himself up in it with Antigonus
and the rest of the captives that he had taken.
Therefore as he approached the walls,
after reconnoitering the site of the fortress, he divided his army into troops
and stationed them in different positions around it.
He likewise ordered some to deny egress to those within,
others to divert the course of the rivers,
and others to destroy parts of the walls with thick battering rams and other war-engines.
And those who carried out his commands contended with every exertion
in which ways they might harass the besieged more cruelly.
