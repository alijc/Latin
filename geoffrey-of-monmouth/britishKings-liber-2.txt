LIBER II

Cognouerat autem Brutus Innogin uxorem suam et ex ea genuit tres inclitos filios,
quibus erant nomina Locrinus, Albanactus, Kamber.
Hii, postquam pater in .xx.iiii. anno aduentus sui ab hoc saeculo migrauit,
sepelierunt eum infra urbem quam condiderat et diuiserunt regnum Britanniae
inter se et secesserunt unusquisque in loco suo.
Locrinus, qui primogenitus fuerat, possedit mediam partem insulae,
quae postea de nomine suo appellata est Loegria;
Kamber autem partem illam quae est ultra Sabrinum flumen,
quae nunc Gualia uocatur,
quae de nomine ipsius postmodum Kambria multo tempore dicta fuit,
unde adhuc gens patriae lingua Britannica sese Kambro appellat;
at Albanactus iunior possedit patriam quae lingua nostra
his temporibus appellatur Scotia et nomen ei ex nomine suo Albania dedit.
Illis deinde concordi pace diu regnantibus,
applicuit Humber rex Hunorum in Albaniam et commisso proelio cum Albanacto
interfecit eum et gentem patriae ad Locrinum diffugere coegit.
======================================================================
Now Brutus had known his wife Imogen and from her begat three renowned sons,
whose names were Locrinus, Albanactus and Kamber.
After their father departed the world in the 24th year after his arrival,
they buried him in the city that he had founded and divided the kingdom of
Britian among themselves, with each one withdrawing into his own territory.
Locrinus, the firstborn, possessed the central portion of the island,
which afterwards was called Loegria, after his own name.
Kamber had that part that is beyond the River Severn, now called Wales,
that was called Cambria, from his own name, for a long time afterwards,
from which the people of the country still call themselves
Cymry in the British tongue.
and the younger Albanactus possessed the country which in our tongue
is called Scotland today and gave the name Albany to it, from his name.
Then, after these men had long reigned in peaceful harmony,
Humber the king of the Huns landed in Albany and killed Albanactus in combat,
forcing his countrymen to flee to Locrinus.
======================================================================

Locrinus igitur, audito rumore,
associauit sibi Kambrum fratrem suum et collegit totam iuuentutem patriae et
iuit obuiam regi Hunorum citra fluuium qui nunc uocatur Humber.
Inito ergo congressu, compulit Humbrum in fugam;
qui usque ad fluuium diffugiens submersus est
infra fluctus et nomen suum flumini reliquit.
Locrius ergo, potitus victoria, spolia hostium sociis largitur,
nichil sibi ipsi retinens praeter aurum et argentum quod infra naues inuenit.
Retinuit quoque sibi tres puellas mirae pulcritudinis,
quarum prima filia fuerat cuiusdam regis Germaniae
quam praedictus Humber cum duabus rapuerat dum patriam uastaret.
Erat nomen illius Estrildis,
et erat tantae pulcritudinis quod non leuiter reperiebatur quae ei conferri
poterat;
candorem carnis eius nec Indicum ebur nec nix recenter cadens nec lilia ulla uincebant.
======================================================================
Now when Locrius heard the news, he joined forces with his brother Kamber,
assembled all the young men of the land and marched against the king of the Huns
on the near side of the river that's now called the Humber.
And so, after battle was joined, he forced Humber into flight;
and he fled to the river and sank beneath the waves and bequeathed his name
to the river.
Then Locrius, having gained the victory, granted the enemy's spoils
to his companions, keeping nothing for himself other than the gold and silver
that he found in their ships.
He also kept for himself three girls of remarkable beauty,
of whom the first had been a daughter of a king of Germany.
The aforesaid Humber had seized her along with the other two
while ravaging their country.
Her name was Estrildis, and she was of such beauty that it wasn't easy
to find her match;
neither Indian ivory nor fleshly fallen snow nor any lily surpassed
the whiteness of her flesh.
======================================================================

Amore itaque illius Locrinus captus uoluit cubilia eius inire ipsamque sibi
maritali taeda copulare.
Quod cum Corineo compertum esset, indignatus est ultra modum,
quoniam Locrinus pactus fuerat sese filiam ipsius ducturum.

Adiuit ergo regem et bipennem in dextera manu librans illum hoc modo 
allocutus est:

"Haeccine rependis michi, Locrine, ob tot uulnera quae in obsequio
patris tui perpessus sum dum proelia cum ignotis committeret gentibus,
ut filia mea postposita tete conubio cuiusdam barbarae summitteres?
Non impune feres dum uigor huic inerit dexterae,
quae tot gigantibus per Tyrrena littora gaudia uitae eripuit".
======================================================================
And so Locrinus, seized with lust for her, wanted to enter her bed
and join her to him under a nuptial torch.
But when Corineus learned of this, he was indignant beyond measure,
because Locrinus had agreed to marry his daughter.

And so he visited the king and, swinging a battle ax in his right hand,
addressed him in this way:

"Is this the way you repay me, Locrinus, for all the wounds that I suffered
in service to your father, when he'd joined battle with strange tribes,
that you'd set my daughter aside to marry some barbarian?
Not with impunity will you carry this off, so long as vigor remains to this
right hand, which snatched away the joys of life from so many giants
up and down the Tyrrhenian coast."
======================================================================

Hoc iterum iterumque proclamans, librabat bipennem quasi percussus eum,
cum amici utrorumque sese interposuerunt.
Sedato uero Corineo, Locrinum quod pepigerat exequi coegerunt.

Duxit itaque Locrinus filiam Corinei, Guendoloenam nomine,
nec tamen Estrildidis amoris oblitus est
sed facto infra urbem Trinouantum subterraneo inclusit eam
in ipso familiaribusque suis honorifice seruandam tradidit.
Volebat saltem furtiuam uenerem cum illa agere; timore namque Corinei anxiatus,
non audebat eam patenter habere sed ut praedictum est occuluit illam
frequentauitque septem annis integris, nemine comperiente exceptis 
illis qui eiusdem familiaritati proximiores fuerant.
Nempe quotienscumque adibat illam fingebat se uelle occultum sacrificium diis
suis facere; unde quosque falsa credulitate mouebat id ipsum aestimare.
======================================================================
Shouting this again and again, he swung his battle-ax as if to strike him,
but their friends interposed themselves between them.
Once Corineus was calm, they forced Locrinus to carry out what he'd agreed to.

And so Locrinus married Corineus' daughter, named Guendoloena,
and yet did not forget his love for Estrildis
but in fact shut her up in the city of Trinovanta in a cellar
and handed her over to his servants to be honorably kept.
He wished to commit venery with her in secret;
for, troubled with fear of Corineus,
he dared not have her openly but, as I already said,
hid her and frequented her for seven whole years,
with no-one learning of it except for his closest intimates.
And truly, whenever he visited her he pretended that he wished to make
a private sacrifice to his gods; and from this false trustworthiness
he made everyone reckon that it was so.
======================================================================

Interea grauida facta est Estrildis ediditque filiam mirae pulcritudinis,
quam uocauit Habren.
Grauida etiam facta est Guendoloena genuitque puerum,
cui impositum est nomen Maddan.
Hic, Corineo auo suo traditus, documenta ipsius discebat.

Subsequente tandem tempore defuncto Corineo deseruit
Locrinus Guendoloenam et Estrildidem in reginam erexit.
Itaque Guendoloena, ultra modum indignans,
adiuit Cornubiam collectaque iuuentute totius
regni illius coepit inquietationem Locrino ingerere.
Conserto tandem utrorumque exercitu,
commiserunt proelium iuxta fluuium Sturam,
ubi Locrinus ictu sagittae percussus gaudia uitae amisit.
======================================================================
Meanwhile, Estrildis became pregnant and gave birth to a daughter
of remarkable beauty, whom she named Habren.
Guendoloena also became pregnant and bore a boy,
to whom was given the name Maddan.
This boy was given to his grandfather Corineus to learn his lessons.

After Corineus finally died,
Locrinus deserted Guendoloena and elevated Estrildis to be queen.
And so Guendoloena, angry beyond measure, 
went to Cornwall and assembled all the young men of that kingdom
and began harassing Locrinus.
In the end, when both armies had been mustered,
they joined battle near the River Stour,
where Locrinus was struck by an arrow and lost the joys of life.
======================================================================

Perempto igitur illo, cepit Guendoloena regni gubernaculum,
paterna insania furens.
Iubet enim Estrildidem et filiam eius Habren praecipitari in fluuium
qui nunc Sabrina dicitur fecitque edictum per totam Britanniam
ut flumen nomine puellae uocaretur;
uolebat etenim honorem aeternitatis illi impendere quia maritus suus eam generauerat.
Vnde contigit quod usque in hunc diem appellatum est flumen Britannica lingua
Habren, quod per corruptionem nominis alia lingua Sabrina uocatur.

Regnauit deinde Guendoloena .xv. annis post interfectionem Locrini,
qui decem annis regnauerat;
et cum uidisset Maddan filium suum aetate adultum,
sceptro regni insigniuit illum,
contenta regione Cornubiae dum reliquum uitae deduceret.
Tunc Samuel propheta regnabat in Iudaea et
Silutus Aeneas uiuebat adhuc et Omerus clarus rethor et poeta habebatur.
======================================================================
And so, once he'd been killed, Guendoloena took control of the kingdon,
raging with the insanity of her father.
For she ordered that Estrildida and her daughter Habren be cast into the river
that is now called the Severn, and she made an edict through all of Britain
that the river should be called after the girl's name;
for she wished eternal honor to be expended to her,
because her own husband had produced her.
From this it happened that up to this day the river is called Habren in the
British language, but was corrupted to Severn in the other language. 

Then Guendoloena ruled for 15 years after the killing of Locrinus,
who had ruled for ten years;
and when she saw that her son Madden was an adult in age,
she distinguished him with the scepter of royal power,
content with the region of Cornwall while she spent the remainder of her life.
At that time the prophet Samuel was ruling in Judea
and Silutus Aeneas was still alive and Homer was held a famous writer and poet.
======================================================================

Insignitus igitur Maddan uxore ex illa genuit duos filios,
Mempricium et Malim,
regnumque cum pace et diligentia quadraginta annis tractauit.
Quo defuncto, discordia orta est inter praedictos fratres propter regnum,
quia uterque totam insulam possidere aestuabat.
Mempricius ergo, affectum suum perficere desiderans,
colloquium iniuit cum Mali quasi concordiam facturus,
sed taeda proditionis inflammatus ipsum inter prolocutores interfecit.
Deinde, regimen tocius insulae nactus,
tantam tyrannidem exercuit in populum quod fere quemque nobilissimum perimebat.
Sed et totam progeniem suam exosus quemcumque sibi in regno posse succedere
timebat uel ui vel proditione opprimebat.
Relicta etiam propria uxore sua, ex qua inclitum iuuenem Ebraucum progenuerat,
sese sodomitanae uoluptati dedit,
non naturalem uenerem naturali libidini praeferens.
======================================================================
And so the distinguished Maddan had two sons, Mempricius and Malim,
with his wife and managed the kingdom with peace and love for forty years.
After he died, discord over the kingdom sprang up between the brothers,
since each one was hot to seize the entire island.
Therefore Mempricius, desiring to carry out his passion,
began a parley with Malim as if to come to an agreement,
but burning with the torch of treason, killed him among the advocates.
Then, having gained control of the entire island,
he exercised such tyranny against the people that he killed nearly every noble.
Hating even his own family, he feared anyone in the kingdom who might succeed
him and crushed them through either force or treachery.
He even abandoned his own wife, who had given birth to the renowned youth
Ebraucus, and gave himself over to the delight of Sodom,
preferring unnatural sex to natural passion.
======================================================================

Vigesimo tandem regni sui anno, dum uenationem faceret,
secessit a sociis suis in quandam conuallem,
ubi a multitudine rabiosorum luporum circundatus miserrime deuoratus est.
Tunc Saul regnabat in Iudaea et Euristeus in Lacedaemonia.
Defuncto itaque Mempricio, Ebraucus filius suus,
uir magnae staturae et mirae fortitudinis,
regimen Britanniae suscepit et triginta nouem annis tenuit.
Hic primus post Brutum classem in partes Galliarum duxit
et illato proelio affecit prouincias caede uirorum atque urbium oppressione
infinitaque auri et argenti copia ditatus cum uictoria reuersus est.
Deinde trans Humbrum condidit ciuitatem,
quam de nomine suo uocauit Kaerebrauc, id est ciuitas Ebrauci.
Et tunc Dauid rex regnabat in Iudaea et Siluius Latinus in Italia
et Gad Nathan et Asaph prophetabant in Israel.
Condidit etiam Ebraucus urbem Aldclud uersus Albaniam et oppidum Montis Agned,
quod nunc Castellum Puellarum dicitur, et Montem Dolorosum.
======================================================================
At last, in the twentieth year of his reign, while he was out hunting,
he withdrew from his companions into a certain valley,
where he was surrounded and wretchedly devoured by a pack of ravening wolves.
At this time Saul was ruling in Judea and Euristeus in Sparta.
And so, once Mempricius was dead, his son Ebraucus,
a man of great stature and remarkable strength,
took control of Britain and held it for thirty-nine years.
He was the first after Brutus to lead a fleet into Gaulish regions.
When battle was joined he afflicted the provinces with the destruction
of people and cities by force and then returned victorious,
enriched with boundless wealth of gold and silver.
Then he founded a city on the far side of the Humber,
which he named 'Karerebrauc', that is, the city of Ebraucus, after himself.
At this time King David reigned in Judea and Siluius Latinus in Italy
and Gad, Nathan and Asaph were prophesying in Israel.
Also, Ebraucus founded the city of Dumbarton, towards Scotland,
and the town of Mount Agned, which is now called Edinburgh, and Mount Sorrowful.
======================================================================

Genuit etiam .xx. filios ex uiginti coniugibus quas habebat nec non 
et .xxx. filias regnumque Britanniae .lx. annis fortissime tractauit.
Erant autem nomina filiorum eius Brutus Viride Scutum, Margadud, Sisillius,
Regin, Moruid, Bladud, Iagon, Bodloan, Kincar, Spaden, Gaul, Dardan,
Eldad, Iuor, Cangu, Hector, Kerin, Rud, Assarach, Buel; nomina autem
filiarum Gloigin, Innogin, Oudas, Guenlian, Gaurdid, Angarad, Guenlodee,
Tangustel, Gorgon, Medlan, Methahel, Ourar, Mailure, Kambreda, Ragan,
Gaei, Ecub, Nest, Chein, Stadud, Gladus, Ebrein, Blangan, Aballac,
Angaes, Galaes (omnium pulcherrima quae tunc in Britannia siue in Gallia
fuerant), Edra, Anor, Stadiald, Egron. Has omnes direxit pater in Italiam
ad Siluium Albam, qui post Siluium Latinum regnabat. Fuerunt ibi maritatae
nobilioribus Troianis, quorum cubilia et Latinae et Sabinae diffugiebant.
At filii duce Assaraco fratre duxerunt classem in Germaniam et auxilio
Siluii Albae usi subiugato populo adepti sunt regnum.
======================================================================
He also begat 20 sons from the twenty consorts that he had and 
30 daughters as well and managed the kingdom of Britain firmly for 60 years.
Now the names of his sons were Brutus Green Shield, Margadud, Sisillius,
Regin, Moruid, Bladud, Iagon, Bodloan, Kincar, Spaden, Gaul, Dardan,
Eldad, Iuor, Cangu, Hector, Kerin, Rud, Assarach and Buel.  The names
of his daughters were Gloigin, Innogin, Oudas, Guenlian, Gaurdid, Angarad,
Guenlodee, Tangustel, Gorgon, Medlan, Methahel, Ourar, Mailure, Kambreda,
Ragan, Gaei, Ecub, Nest, Chein, Stadud, Gladus, Ebrein, Blangan, Aballac,
Angaes, Galaes (who were at that time the most beautiful of all in Britain
or Gaul) Edra, Anor, Stadiald, and Egron. Their father sent them all to Italy,
to Silvius Alba, who reigned after Silvius Latinus.
They were there given in marriage to well-born Trojans,
whose beds were rejected by both Latin and Sabine women.
But his sons, with their brother Assaracus leading, took ship to Germany and,
with Silvius Alba's aid, subjugated the people and gained the kingdom.
======================================================================

Brutus autem cognomento Viride Scutum cum patre remansit regnique
gubernaculo post illum potitus xii. annis regnauit. Huic successit Leil filius
suus, pacis amator et aequitatis, qui ut prosperitate regni usus est urbem in
aquilonari parte Britanniae aedificauit, de nomine suo Kaerleil uocatam.
Tunc Salomon coepit aedificare templum Domino in lerusalem et regina
Saba uenit audire sapientiam eius, et tunc Siluius Epitus patri Albae in
regnum successit. Vixit deinde Leil post sumptum regnum .xxv. annis sed
regnum in fine tepide rexit. Quocirca segnicia eius insistente ciuilis discordia
in regno orta est. Post hunc regnauit filius suus Rud Hudibras xxxix.
annis. Ipse, populum ex ciuili discidio in concordiam reducens, condidit
Kaerkein, id est Cantuariam. Condidit etiam Kaergueint, id est Guintoniam,
atque oppidum Montis Paladur, quod nunc Seftonia dicitur. Ibi tunc aquila 120
locuta est dum murus aedificaretur; cuius sermones si ueros esse arbitrarer
sicut cetera memoriae dare non diffugerem. Tunc Capis filius Epiti regnabat
et Aggeus Amos Ieu Iohel Azarias prophetabant.
======================================================================
But Brutus, who was called Greenshield, remained with his father and
after obtaining the government of the kingdom after him, reigned for 12 years.
He was succeeded by his son, Leil, a lover of peace and justice,
who, while enjoying the prosperity of the kingdom, founded a city
in the northern part of Britain, that was called Carlisle after him.
At that time Solomon began to build the temple to the Lord in Jerusalem
and the Queen of Sheba came to hear his wisdom, and Silvius Epitus succeeded
to his father Alba's kingdom.  Now Leil lived for 25 years after his assumption
but ruled the kingdom tepidly in the end. On account of this, from his
continued feebleness a civil war arose in the kingdom. His son Rud Hudibras
ruled for 39 years after him.  He led the people back from civil war and
into harmony and restored Kaerkein, that is, Canterbury.  He also restored
Kaergueint, that is, Wincester, and the town of Mount Paladur, which is now
called Shaftsbury.  It was there that an eagle spoke while city wall was
being built; and if I supposed its words to be true I'd not avoid writing
them down, just like the rest of this history.
At that time Capis, the son of Epitus, reigned and Haggai, Amos, Jehu, Joel and
Azarias were prophesying.
======================================================================

Successit ei deinde Bladud filius tractauitque regnum uiginti annis.
Hic aedificauit urbem Kaerbadum, quae nunc Bado nuncupatur,
fecitque in illa calida balnea ad usus mortalium apta,
quibus praefecit numen Mineruae, in cuius aede inextinguibiles posuit ignes,
qui nunquam deficiebant in fauillas
sed ex quo tabescere incipiebant in saxeos globos uertebantur.
Tunc Helias orauit ne plueret super terram et non pluit annos tres et menses sex.
Hic admodum ingeniosus homo fuit docuitque nigromantiam per regnum Britanniae
nec praestigia facere quieuit donec paratis sibi alis ire
per summitatem aeris temptauit
ceciditque super templum Apollinis infra urbem Trinouantum,
in multa frusta contritus.

Dato igitur fatis Bladud, erigitur Leir filius eiusdem in regem,
qui .lx. annis patriam uiriliter rexit.
======================================================================
Then his son Bladud succeeded him and managed the kingdom for twenty years.
He built the town of Kaerbadum, which is now called Bath,
and built hot baths in it fit for human use.
He put these under the charge of the goddess Minerva,
in whose temple he placed unquenchable fires, that never faded away into ash,
but were turned into stone balls when they began to fail.
(At that time Elijah prayed to keep rain from the earth and it didn't
rain for three years and six months.)
He was a very ingenious man and taught black magic throughout the kingdom of
Britain and didn't stop performing magic until,
having prepared wings for himself, he tried to fly high into the air
and fell unto the temple of Apollo in the city of Trinovantum,
crushed into many pieces.

And so, after Bladud passed away, his son Lear was elevated to king,
and ruled his country with vigor for 60 years.
======================================================================

Aedificauit autem super flumen Soram ciuitatem,
quae Britannice de nomine eius Kaerleir, Saxonice uero Lerecestre nuncupatur.
Cui negata masculini sexus prole natae sunt
tantummodo tres filiae, uocatae Gonorilla, Regau, Cordeilla.
Pater eas miro amore sed magis iuniorem, uidelicet Cordeillam, diligebat.
Cumque in senectutem uergere coepisset, cogitauit regnum suum ipsis diuidere
easque talibus maritis copulare qui easdem cum regno haberent;
sed ut sciret quae illarum parte regni potiore dignior esset,
adiuit singulas ut interrogaret quae ipsum magis diligeret.
Interrogante igitur illo, Gonorilla prius numina caeli testata est
ipsum sibi maiori dilectioni esse quam animam quae in corpore suo degebat.
Cui pater:

'Quoniam senectutem meam uitae tuae praeposuisti, te, carissima filia,
 maritabo iuueni quemcumque elegeris cum tercia parte regni Britanniae'.
======================================================================
Now he built a city on the River Soar,
which is called Kaerleir in British, from his name, and Leicester in Saxon.
Now he, having been denied offspring of the masculine gender, 
begat only three daughters, named Goneril, Regan and Cordelia.
Their father regarded them with wonderful love, but the youngest, namely
Cordelia, most of all.
And when he began to sink into old age, he thought to share his kingdom with them
and to couple them with such husbands as might keep them along with the kingdom;
but in order to know which of them was more deserving of a greater share of the
kingdom, he visited each one in turn to ask who loved him the most.
And so, when he asked Goneril first, she swore on the gods of heaven
that he was dearer to her than the soul that resided in her body.
And her father said to her:

'My dearest daughter, since you have put my old age before your own life,
 I will give you in marriage to whichever young man you choose,
 with a third part of the kingdom of Britain.'
======================================================================

Deinde Regau, quae secunda erat,
exemplo sororis suae beniuolentiam patris allicere uolens,
iureiurando respondit se nullatenus aliter exprimere 
nisi quod illum super omnes creaturas diligeret.
Credulus ergo pater iurauit quod eadem dignitate
quam primogenitae promiserat ipsam cum alia parte regni maritaret.
At Cordeilla iunior,
cum intellexisset eum praedictarum adulationibus acquieuisse,
temptare illum cupiens aliter respondere perrexit:

'Est uspiam, pater mi, filia quae patrem suum plus quam patrem praesumat diligere?
Non reor equidem ullam esse quae hoc fateri audeat
nisi iocosis uerbis ueritatem celare nitatur.
Nempe ego dilexi te semper ut patrem et adhuc a proposito meo non diuertor.
Et si ex me magis extorquere insistis,
audi certitudinem amoris quem aduersum te habeo
et interrogationibus tuis finem impone.
Etenim quantum habes tantum uales tantumque te diligo'.
======================================================================
Then Regan, his second daughter, wished to gain her father's favor,
after her sister's example, and answered with an oath
that she herself could say nothing else but that she
loved him above all other creatures.
And so, her credulous father swore that he would marry her off with the same
dignity as he had promised his first-born, with another part of the kingdom.
But when the youngest one, Cordelia, realized that he'd been taken in by the
flatteries of the aforementioned sisters, 
she desired to test him, and proceeded to reply in a different vein:

"Is there anywhere, my father, a daughter who presumes to love her father more
than a father?
For my part, I don't think there is anyone who dares to admit this
unless she's trying to conceal the truth with joking speech.
Certainly I have always loved you as my father and am still
not swayed from my purpose.
But if you insist on extorting more from me, hear the assurance of love
that I hold towards you and put an end to your questions.
Indeed you have as much as you can have, and that's how much I love you."
======================================================================

Porro pater, ratus eam ex habundantia cordis dixisse, uehementer indignans
quod responsurus erat hoc modo manifestare non distulit:

"Quia in tantum senectutem patris tui spreuisti ut uel eo amore quo me
sorores tuae dedignata es diligere, et ego dedignabor te, nec umquam
partem in regno meo cum sororibus habebis.
Non dico tamen, cum filia mea sis,
quin te alicui externo si illum fortuna optulerit utcumque maritem.
Illud autem affirmo, quod numquam eo honore quo sorores tuas maritare laborabo,
quippe cum te plus quam ceteras hucusque dilexerim,
tu uero me minus quam ceterae diligas".
======================================================================
Then her father, sure that she had spoken from an abundance of spirit
and so indignant that she had answered in this way, made no delay in plain-speaking:

"Since you have scorned me, your father, in my old age so much
that you refuse to honor me with even the same love as your sisters,
I will refuse you, and you will hold no part of my kingdom with your sisters.
Yet I say, since you are my daughter,
that I will still give you in marriage to any foreigner, if fortune were to
offer such a man.
But I affirm one thing, that I will never take pains
with to bestow this honor on you that I will give your sisters,
since, naturally, I had up to now loved you more than the others,
while you truly love me less than they do."
======================================================================

Nec mora, consilio procerum regni dedit praedictas puellas duas duobus
ducibus, Cornubiae uidelicet et Albaniae, cum medietate tantum insulae
dum ipse uiueret; post obitum autem eius totam monarchiam Britanniae
concessit habendam. Contigit deinde quod Aganippus rex Francorum,
audita fama pulcritudinis Cordeillae, continuo nuntios suos ad regem
direxit, rogans ut ipsa sibi coniugali taeda copulanda traderetur. At pater, in
praenominata ira adhuc perseuerans, respondit se illam libenter daturum,
sed sine terra et pecunia; regnum namque suum cum omni auro et argento
Gonorillae et Regau puellae sororibus distribuerat. Cumque id Aganippo
nunciatum fuisset, amore uirginis inflammatus remisit iterum ad Leirem
regem, dicens se satis auri et argenti aliarumque possessionum habere, quia
tertiam partem Galliae possidebat; se uero tantummodo puellam captare, ut
heredes ex illa haberet. Denique, confirmato foedere, mittitur Cordeilla ad
Galliam et Aganippo maritatur.
======================================================================
And without delay, on the advice of the kingdom's nobles,
he gave the aforesaid two girls to two dukes, those of Cornwall and Albany,
with one half of the island only while he lived;
but he allowed them to have the entire rule of Britain after his death. 
It then happened that Aganippus, king of the Francs,
having heard a rumor of Cordelia's beauty, at once sent his envoys to the king,
asking that she be delivered to be joined to him under a marital torch.
But her father, still steadfast in his aforementioned rage, replied
that he would freely give her, but without land or money, as he had divided
his kingdom along with all his gold and silver between Goneril and Regan,
the girl's sisters. And after this was reported to Aganippus, inflamed with
love for the maiden, sent back to Lear, saying that he possessed enough
gold and silver, since he possessed a third of Gaul; indeed, he merely wanted to
have the girl, in order to have heirs from her.  Finally, with an agreement
reached, Cordelia was sent to Gaul and wed to Aganippus.
======================================================================

Post multum uero temporis, ut Leir torpere coepit senio, insurrexerunt
in illum praedicti duces quibus Britannam cum filiabus diuiserat;
abstulerunt autem ei regnum regiamque potestatem, quam usque ad illud
tempus uiriliter et gloriose tenuerat. Concordia tamen habita, retinuit eum
alter generorum Magglaunus, dux Albaniae, cum quadraginta militibus, ne
secum inglorius maneret. Elapso deinde biennio, moram eo apud generum
faciente, indignata est Gonorilla filia sua ob multitudinem militum eius, qui
conuicia ministris inferebant quia sibi profusior epimonia non praebebatur.
Proinde maritum suum affata iussit patrem obsequio triginta militum
contentum esse, relictis ceteris quos habuerat. Vnde ille iratus relicto
Maglauno petiuit Henuinum ducem Cornubiae, cui alteram natam Regau
maritauerat; et cum a duce honorifice receptus fuisset, non praeteriit annus
quin inter utrorumque familias discordia orta fuerat.
======================================================================
Indeed, after a great deal of time, as Lear began to grow old,
the previously named dukes and his daughters, with whom he'd divided Britain,
rose up against him.
And they snatched the kingdom and royal power away from him,
which he'd held with vigor and glory up to that time.
Now after the peace was restored, Maglaunus,
one of his sons-in-law and the duke of Albany,
retained him along with forty soldiers, lest he live with him without honor.
Then, after two years had elapsed while he bided his time at his son-in-law's,
his daughter Goneril was indignant at the great number of his soldiers,
who insulted her servants because she wasn't supplying enough food to them.
So then she spoke to her husband and told him that her father should be content
with a retinue of thirty soldiers, keeping those and giving up the rest.
Now this enraged Lear and he left Maglaunus to make for Henuinus, the duke of
Cornwall, who had married his other daughter, Regan.
But after he had been honorably received by the duke, 
not a year went by before discord sprang up between the two households.
======================================================================

Quam ob rem Regau in indignationem uersa praecepit patri cunctos socios
deserere praeter quinque qui ei obsequium praestarent.
Porro pater, ultra modum anxius, reuersus est iterum ad primogenitam,
existimans se posse commouere illam in pietatem ut cum familia sua retineretur.
At illa nequaquam a coepta indignatione reuersa est
sed per numina caeli iurauit quod nullatenus secum commaneret
nisi postpositis ceteris solo milite contentus fuisset;
increpabat etiam eum senem et in nulla re abundantem uelle cum tanta familia incedere.
======================================================================
And on account of this Regan was angered in her turn and ordered her father
to give up all his companions, except for five to serve as his retinue.
And her father, upset beyond measure, returned back again to his first-born,
thinking that he'd be able to stir her pity and so keep his household.
But she hadn't turned her back on her earlier anger one whit
and swore on the gods of heaven that there was no way he could stay with her,
unless he put aside most of his men and be content with only a single soldier;
she chided him that he, old as he was and rich in nothing,
wished to proceed with such a large following. 
======================================================================

Cumque illa assensum uoluntati eius nullo modo praebuisset,
paruit ipse et relictis ceteris cum solo milite remansit.
At cum in memoria pristinae dignitatis reductus fuisset,
detestando miseriam in quam redactus erat,
cogitare coepit quod iuniorem filiam trans occeanum exigeret,
sed dubitabat ipsam nil uelle sibi facere,
quoniam eam tam ingloriose ut praedictum est dedisset.
Indignans tamen miseriam suam diutius ferre, transfretauit ad Gallias;
sed transfretando cum se tercium infra nauim inter principes
qui aderant aspexisset, in haec uerba cum fletu et singultu prorupit:

'O inreuocabilia seria fatorum, quae solito cursu fixum iter tenditis,
 cur unquam me ad instabilem felicitatem promouere uoluistis,
 cum maior poena sit ipsam amissam recolere quam sequentis infelicitatis praesentia urgeri?
======================================================================
And after she had by no means given her assent to his wish, he obeyed her
and remained there with only a single soldier, letting the rest go.
But when he was drawn back to the memory of his former dignity,
cursing the misery that he'd been reduced to,
he began to think that he should seek out his youngest daughter, across the sea,
but doubted that she would wish to do anything for him,
since he'd so ingloriously given her away as has already been said.
Nevertheless, too indignant to bear his woe any longer,
he crossed the sea to Gaul;
but on the crossing, after he observed that he was the third among the princes
who were present aboard the ship,
he broke out, weeping and sobbing, in these words:

'O grave irrevocable course of the fates,
 who travels an unchanging path in its wonted course,
 why did you ever wish to advance me to an inconstant fortune,
 when a greater punishment would be call my lost daughter to my mind,
 than to be hemmed in by the presence of the next misfortune?
======================================================================

 Magis etenim aggrauat me illius temporis memoria quo tot centenis milibus
 militum stipatus et moenia urbium diruere et prouincias hostium uastare
 solebam quam calamitas miseriae meae,
 quae ipsos qui iam sub pedibus meis iacebant debilitatem meam deserere coegit.
 O irata fortuna!
 Venietne dies umquam qua ipsis uicem reddere potero
 qui sic tempora mea secuti paupertatem meam diffugierunt?
 O Cordeilla filia, quam uera sunt dicta illa quae michi respondisti
 quando quaesiui a te quem amorem aduersum me haberes!
 Dixisti enim "quantum habes tantum uales tantumque te diligo".
 Dum igitur habui quod potui dare, uisus fui ualere eis
 qui non michi sed donis meis amici fuerant.
 Interim dilexerunt me sed magis munera mea;
 nam abeuntibus muneribus et ipsi abierunt.
 Sed qua fronte, karissima filia, te audebo exigere,
 qui ob praedicta uerba iratus putaui te maritare deterius quam sorores tuas,
 quae post beneficia quae eis impendi me exulem et pauperem esse patiuntur?".
======================================================================
 And indeed, it pains me more to remember the time when I,
 crowded together with so many hundreds of thousands of soldiers,
 used to demolish city walls and lay waste to enemy provinces,
 than the calamity of my misery,
 which compelled those who had lately lain prostrate at my feet
 to desert me in my infirmity.
 O wrathful fortune!
 Will the day never come in which I will be able in turn to repay those
 who followed me thus in good times, but fled me in my poverty?
 O my daughter Cordelia, how true is the answer that you gave me
 when I asked you how much love you held towards me!
 For you said "However much you have and are worth, that much I love you".
 Therefore, while I had the wherewithal to give, I was seen as worthy
 by those who had been friends, not to me, but to my gifts.
 For a time they loved me, but my gifts more;
 for when the gifts went away, they themselves departed.
 But with what impudence, dearest daughter, shall I dare to beg of you,
 I who, in anger over the words you spoke,
 thought to marry you off more poorly than your sisters,
 who, after the kindnesses that I expended to them,
 suffered me to be a poor man and an exile?
======================================================================

Vt tandem haec et similia dicendo applicuit, uenit Karitiam, ubi filia sua erat.
Expectans autem extra urbem,
misit ei nuncium suum qui indicaret ipsum in tantam miseriam collapsum;
et quia non habebat quid comederet uel indueret, misericordiam illius petebat.
Quo indicato, commota est Cordeilla et fleuit amare quaesiuitque quot milites
secum habuisset.
Qui respondit ipsum neminem habere,
excepto quodam armigero qui foris cum eo expectabat.
Tunc illa cepit quantum opus erat auri et argenti deditque nuncio,
praecipiens ut patrem ad aliam ciuitatem duceret ibique ipsum infirmum fingeret
et balnearet, indueret, foueret.
Iussit etiam ut sexaginta milites bene indutos et paratos retineret et tunc
demum mandaret regi Aganippo et filiae suae sese aduenisse.
Nuncius ilico reuersus duxit Leirem regem ad aliam ciuitatem absconditque eum
ibi donec omnia quae Cordeilla iusserat perfecisset. 
======================================================================
At last, speaking these and similar words,
he landed and came to Karitia, where his daughter was.
But he waited outside the city, sending her his messenger,
to tell her that he had fallen into such great misery;
and since he had nothing to eat or wear, he was begging for her mercy.
And after this was revealed, Cordelia was moved and wept bitterly and
asked how many soldiers he had with him.
And he replied the he had no-one,
except a certain squire who was waiting with him outside.
She then took as much gold and silver as was needed and gave it to him,
instructing him to take her father to another city and 
there pretend that he was ill, and bathe him, clothe him and care for him.
She also commanded that he should retain sixty soldiers,
well clothed and equipped, and then ordered that after that he should come to
King Aganippus and his daughter. 
The messenger immediately led King Lear back to the other city and hid him
there until he'd accomplished everything that Cordelia had commanded.
======================================================================

Mox, ut regio apparatu exornatus et familia insignitus fuit,
mandauit Aganippo et filiae sese a generis suis expulsum fuisse
ex regno Britanniae et ad ipsos uenisse ut auxilio eorum patriam suam
recuperare ualuisset.
At illi, cum consulibus et proceribus obuiam uenientes,
honorifice susceperunt illum dederuntque ei potestatem totius Galliae
donec eum in pristinam dignitatem restaurassent.

Interea misit Aganippus legatos per uniuersam Galliam ad colligendum
in ea omnem armatum militem ut auxilio suo regnum Britanniae Leiri socero
reddere laboraret.
Quo facto, duxit secum Leir filiam et collectam multitudinem in Britanniam
pugnauitque cum generis et triumpho potitus est. 
Deinde, cum quosque potestati suae reddidisset, in tercio anno mortuus est.
======================================================================
As soon as he was arrayed in regal trappings and distiguished with a household,
he sent word to Aganippus and his daughter that he had been banished
from the kingdom of Britain by his sons-in-law and had come to them
so that he might prevail to restore his homeland with their aid. 
Now they came to meet him with their magistrates and nobles, and
received him honorably and gave him all the power of of Gaul
until they should have restored him to his former dignity. 

Meanwhile, Aganippus sent messengers throughout Gaul to levy every man-of-arms
in it, so he could work to to return the kingdom of Britain
to his father-in-law, Lear, with their aid. 
When this was done, Lear took his daughter and the amassed multitude with him
into Britain and fought with his sons-in-law and won a triumph.
Then, after he had returned them each under his rule, he died, three years later.
======================================================================

Mortuus est etiam Aganippus rex Francorum.
Cordeilla ergo filia, regni gubernaculum adepta, sepeliuit patrem
in quodam subterraneo quod sub Sora fluuio infra Legecestriam fieri praeceperat.
Erat autem subterraneum illud conditum in honore bifrontis Iani.
Ibi omnes operarii urbis, adueniente sollempnitate dei,
opera quae per annum acturi erant incipiebant.

Cum igitur Cordeilla regnum per quinquennium pacifice tractasset, 
coeperunt eam inquietare duo filii sororum suarum, Marganus et Cunedagius,
quae Maglauro et Henuino ducibus coniugatae fuerant.
Ambo iuuenes praeclarae probitatis famam habebant;
quorum alterum, uidelicet Marganum, Maglaurus generauerat, Cunedagium uero Henuinus.
======================================================================
Aganippus, the king of the Franks, also died.
And so Lear's daughter Cordelia succeeded to the kingdom and buried her father
in an underground chamber that he'd ordered to be built
close to the River Soar in Leicester.
Now that chamber had been built in honor of two-faced Janus.
It was there that, when that god's solemnity came, all the city's laborers
would begin the work that was to be done during the coming year.

Now, after Cordelia had managed the kingdom peacibly for five years,
she began to be harrased by Marganus and Cunedagius,
the two sons of her sisters, who had been wed to Maglaurus and Henuinus.
Both young men had a reputation of distinguished repute;
of these Marganus had been fathered by Maglaurus, and Cunedagius by Henuinus.
======================================================================

Hi itaque, cum post obitum patrum in ducatus eisdem successissent,
indignati sunt Britanniam femineae potestati subditam esse.
Collectis ergo exercitibus, in reginam insurrexerunt nec saeuiciae suae
desistere uoluerunt donec quibusque prouinciis uastatis proelia cum ipsa
commiserunt;
eam quoque ad ultimum captam in carcerem posuerunt,
ubi ob amissionem regni dolore obducta sese interfecit.
Exin partiti sunt iuuenes insulam,
cuius pars illa quae trans Humbrum extenditur uersus Katanesiam Margano cessit,
alia uero, quae in altera parte fluuii ad occasum solis uergit,
Cunedagio summittitur.
Emenso deinde biennio, accesserunt quibus turbatio regni placebat ad Marganum
animumque illius subducentes aiebant turpe et dedecus esse ipsum,
cum primogenitus esset, totius insulae non dominari.
Cumque his et pluribus aliis modis incitatus fuisset,
duxit exercitum per prouincias Cunedagii ignemque accumulare incepit.
======================================================================
And so, when they'd succeeded to their dukedoms after their fathers' deaths,
they were indignant that Britain was under a woman's power.
Therefore, they gathered their armies and rose up against the queen
and were unwilling to leave off from their savagery until they'd
engaged her in battle while laying waste to her provinces;
in the end, they captured her and threw her into prison,
where she killed herself in despair over the loss of her kingdom.
After that, the young men divided up the island -
the part that stretches beyond the Humber to Caithness fell to Marganus,
and the other part, to the west of the river, was given to Cunedagius.
Then, after two years had been measured out, some people who
took delight in turmoil in the kingdom approached Marganus and,
disgracefully yanking at his pride, said that it was shameful to him,
since he was the first-born, that he was not master of the whole island.
And when he'd been urged on in these and in many other ways,
he led an army through Cunedagius' provinces and started one fire after another.
======================================================================

Orta igitur discordia, obuiauit ei Cunedagius cum omni multitudine sua
factoque congressu caedem intulit non minimam et Marganum in fugam propulit.
Deinde secutus est eum fugientem a prouincia in prouinciam.
Tandem intercepit eum in pago Kambriae qui post interfectionem nomine suo,
uidelicet Margan, hucusque a pagensibus appellatus est.
Potitus itaque uictoria Cunedagius monarchiam totius insulae adeptus est
eamque xxxiii. annis gloriose tractauit.
Tunc Ysaias et Osea prophetabant et Roma condita est .xi. kl Mai a geminis fratribus Remo et Romulo.

Postremo defuncto Cunedagio successit ei Riuallo filius ipsius,
iuuenis pacificus atque fortunatus, qui regnum cum diligentia gubernauit.
In tempore eius tribus diebus cecidit pluuia sanguinea et muscarum affluentia homines moriebantur.
======================================================================
And so, after war sprang up, Cunedagius met him with all his men
and inflicted no small slaughter in the battle, putting Marganus to flight.
Then he pursued him as he fled from province to province.
In the end, he caught up with him in a district of Wales which is,
after the murder, called by his name, that is, Margam, up to this day by its inhabitants.
Having thus gained the victory, Cunedagius obtained rule over the entire
island and managed it gloriously for 33 years.
At that time Isaiah and Hosea were prophesying and Rome was established on the
11 Kalends of Mai by the twin brothers Remus and Romulus.

Finally, after Cunedagius' death, he was succeeded by his son Rivallo,
a peaceful and fortunate youth, who governed the kingdom with diligence.
In his time a bloody rain fell for three days and men perished from an
deluge of flies.
======================================================================


Post hunc successit Gurgustius filius eius, cui Sisillius, cui Iago Gurgustii nepos, cui Kinmarcus Sisillii filius, post hunc Gorbodugo. Huic nati fuerunt duo filii, quorum unus Ferreux, alter Porrex nuncupabatur. Cum autem pater in senium uergisset, orta est contentio inter eos quis eorum in regno succederet. At Porrex, maiori cupiditate subductus, paratis insidiis Ferreucem fratrem interficere parat. Quod cum illi compertum fuisset, uitato fratre transfretauit in Gallias sed usus auxilio Suhardi regis Francorum reuersus est et cum fratre dimicauit. Pugnantibus autem illis, interfectus est Ferreux et tota multitudo quae eum comitabatur.
