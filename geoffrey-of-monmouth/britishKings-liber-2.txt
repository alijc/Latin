LIBER II

Cognouerat autem Brutus Innogin uxorem suam et ex ea genuit tres inclitos filios,
quibus erant nomina Locrinus, Albanactus, Kamber.
Hii, postquam pater in .xx.iiii. anno aduentus sui ab hoc saeculo migrauit,
sepelierunt eum infra urbem quam condiderat et diuiserunt regnum Britanniae
inter se et secesserunt unusquisque in loco suo.
Locrinus, qui primogenitus fuerat, possedit mediam partem insulae,
quae postea de nomine suo appellata est Loegria;
Kamber autem partem illam quae est ultra Sabrinum flumen,
quae nunc Gualia uocatur,
quae de nomine ipsius postmodum Kambria multo tempore dicta fuit,
unde adhuc gens patriae lingua Britannica sese Kambro appellat;
at Albanactus iunior possedit patriam quae lingua nostra
his temporibus appellatur Scotia et nomen ei ex nomine suo Albania dedit.

Illis deinde concordi pace diu regnantibus,
applicuit Humber rex Hunorum in Albaniam et commisso proelio cum Albanacto
interfecit eum et gentem patriae ad Locrinum diffugere coegit.

But Brutus had known his wife Imogen and from her begat three renowned sons,
whose names were Locrinus, Albanactus and Kamber.
After their father departed the world in the 24th year after his arrival,
they buried him in the city that he had founded and divided the kingdom of
Britian among themselves. And each one withdrew into his own territory.
Locrinus, who was the firstborn, possessed the central portion of the island,
which afterwards was called Loegria, after his own name;
but Kamber had that part that is beyond the River Severn, now called Gualia,
that was called Cambria, from his own name, for a long time afterwards;
and the younger Albanactus possessed the country which in our tongue
is called Scotland in the present time and gave the name Albany to it,
from his name.
Then, after these men had long reign in peaceful harmony, Humber the king of the
Huns landed in Albany and engaged in combat with Albanactus,
killing him and forcing the people of his country homeland to flee to Locrinus.

Locrinus igitur, audito rumore, associauit sibi Kambrum fratrem
suum et collegit totam iuuentutem patriae et iuit obuiam regi Hunorum
citra fluuium qui nunc uocatur Humber. Inito ergo congressu, compulit
