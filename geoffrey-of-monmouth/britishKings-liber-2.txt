LIBER II

Cognouerat autem Brutus Innogin uxorem suam et ex ea genuit tres inclitos filios,
quibus erant nomina Locrinus, Albanactus, Kamber.
Hii, postquam pater in .xx.iiii. anno aduentus sui ab hoc saeculo migrauit,
sepelierunt eum infra urbem quam condiderat et diuiserunt regnum Britanniae
inter se et secesserunt unusquisque in loco suo.
Locrinus, qui primogenitus fuerat, possedit mediam partem insulae,
quae postea de nomine suo appellata est Loegria;
Kamber autem partem illam quae est ultra Sabrinum flumen,
quae nunc Gualia uocatur,
quae de nomine ipsius postmodum Kambria multo tempore dicta fuit,
unde adhuc gens patriae lingua Britannica sese Kambro appellat;
at Albanactus iunior possedit patriam quae lingua nostra
his temporibus appellatur Scotia et nomen ei ex nomine suo Albania dedit.
Illis deinde concordi pace diu regnantibus,
applicuit Humber rex Hunorum in Albaniam et commisso proelio cum Albanacto
interfecit eum et gentem patriae ad Locrinum diffugere coegit.
======================================================================
Now Brutus had known his wife Imogen and from her begat three renowned sons,
whose names were Locrinus, Albanactus and Kamber.
After their father departed the world in the 24th year after his arrival,
they buried him in the city that he had founded and divided the kingdom of
Britian among themselves, with each one withdrawing into his own territory.
Locrinus, the firstborn, possessed the central portion of the island,
which afterwards was called Loegria, after his own name.
Kamber had that part that is beyond the River Severn, now called Wales,
that was called Cambria, from his own name, for a long time afterwards,
from which the people of the country still call themselves
Cymry in the British tongue.
and the younger Albanactus possessed the country which in our tongue
is called Scotland today and gave the name Albany to it, from his name.
Then, after these men had long reigned in peaceful harmony,
Humber the king of the Huns landed in Albany and killed Albanactus in combat,
forcing his countrymen to flee to Locrinus.
======================================================================

Locrinus igitur, audito rumore,
associauit sibi Kambrum fratrem suum et collegit totam iuuentutem patriae et
iuit obuiam regi Hunorum citra fluuium qui nunc uocatur Humber.
Inito ergo congressu, compulit Humbrum in fugam;
qui usque ad fluuium diffugiens submersus est
infra fluctus et nomen suum flumini reliquit.
Locrius ergo, potitus victoria, spolia hostium sociis largitur,
nichil sibi ipsi retinens praeter aurum et argentum quod infra naues inuenit.
Retinuit quoque sibi tres puellas mirae pulcritudinis,
quarum prima filia fuerat cuiusdam regis Germaniae
quam praedictus Humber cum duabus rapuerat dum patriam uastaret.
Erat nomen illius Estrildis,
et erat tantae pulcritudinis quod non leuiter reperiebatur quae ei conferri
poterat;
candorem carnis eius nec Indicum ebur nec nix recenter cadens nec lilia ulla uincebant.
======================================================================
Now when Locrius heard the news, he joined forces with his brother Kamber,
assembled all the young men of the land and marched against the king of the Huns
on the near side of the river that's now called the Humber.
And so, after battle was joined, he forced Humber into flight;
and he fled to the river and sank beneath the waves and bequeathed his name
to the river.
Then Locrius, having gained the victory, granted the enemy's spoils
to his companions, keeping nothing for himself other than the gold and silver
that he found in their ships.
He also kept for himself three girls of remarkable beauty,
of whom the first had been a daughter of a king of Germany.
The aforesaid Humber had seized her along with the other two
while ravaging their country.
Her name was Estrildis, and she was of such beauty that it wasn't easy
to find her match;
neither Indian ivory nor fleshly fallen snow nor any lily surpassed
the whiteness of her flesh.
======================================================================

Amore itaque illius Locrinus captus uoluit cubilia eius inire ipsamque sibi
maritali taeda copulare.
Quod cum Corineo compertum esset, indignatus est ultra modum,
quoniam Locrinus pactus fuerat sese filiam ipsius ducturum.

Adiuit ergo regem et bipennem in dextera manu librans illum hoc modo 
allocutus est:

"Haeccine rependis michi, Locrine, ob tot uulnera quae in obsequio
patris tui perpessus sum dum proelia cum ignotis committeret gentibus,
ut filia mea postposita tete conubio cuiusdam barbarae summitteres?
Non impune feres dum uigor huic inerit dexterae,
quae tot gigantibus per Tyrrena littora gaudia uitae eripuit".
======================================================================
And so Locrinus, seized with lust for her, wanted to enter her bed
and join her to him under a nuptial torch.
But when Corineus learned of this, he was indignant beyond measure,
because Locrinus had agreed to marry his daughter.

And so he visited the king and, swinging a battle ax in his right hand,
addressed him in this way:

"Is this the way you repay me, Locrinus, for all the wounds that I suffered
in service to your father, when he'd joined battle with strange tribes,
that you'd set my daughter aside to marry some barbarian?
Not with impunity will you carry this off, so long as vigor remains to this
right hand, which snatched away the joys of life from so many giants
up and down the Tyrrhenian coast."
======================================================================

Hoc iterum iterumque proclamans, librabat bipennem quasi percussus eum,
cum amici utrorumque sese interposuerunt.
Sedato uero Corineo, Locrinum quod pepigerat exequi coegerunt.

Duxit itaque Locrinus filiam Corinei, Guendoloenam nomine,
nec tamen Estrildidis amoris oblitus est
sed facto infra urbem Trinouantum subterraneo inclusit eam
in ipso familiaribusque suis honorifice seruandam tradidit.
Volebat saltem furtiuam uenerem cum illa agere; timore namque Corinei anxiatus,
non audebat eam patenter habere sed ut praedictum est occuluit illam
frequentauitque septem annis integris, nemine comperiente exceptis 
illis qui eiusdem familiaritati proximiores fuerant.
Nempe quotienscumque adibat illam fingebat se uelle occultum sacrificium diis
suis facere; unde quosque falsa credulitate mouebat id ipsum aestimare.
======================================================================
Shouting this again and again, he swung his battle-ax as if to strike him,
but their friends interposed themselves between them.
Once Corineus was calm, they forced Locrinus to carry out what he'd agreed to.

And so Locrinus married Corineus' daughter, named Guendoloena,
and yet did not forget his love for Estrildis
but in fact shut her up in the city of Trinovanta in a cellar
and handed her over to his servants to be honorably kept.
He wished to commit venery with her in secret;
for, troubled with fear of Corineus,
he dared not have her openly but, as I already said,
hid her and frequented her for seven whole years,
with no-one learning of it except for his closest intimates.
And truly, whenever he visited her he pretended that he wished to make
a private sacrifice to his gods; and from this false trustworthiness
he made everyone reckon that it was so.
======================================================================

Interea grauida facta est Estrildis ediditque filiam mirae pulcritudinis,
quam uocauit Habren.
Grauida etiam facta est Guendoloena genuitque puerum,
cui impositum est nomen Maddan.
Hic, Corineo auo suo traditus, documenta ipsius discebat.

Subsequente tandem tempore defuncto Corineo deseruit
Locrinus Guendoloenam et Estrildidem in reginam erexit.
Itaque Guendoloena, ultra modum indignans,
adiuit Cornubiam collectaque iuuentute totius
regni illius coepit inquietationem Locrino ingerere.
Conserto tandem utrorumque exercitu,
commiserunt proelium iuxta fluuium Sturam,
ubi Locrinus ictu sagittae percussus gaudia uitae amisit.
======================================================================
Meanwhile, Estrildis became pregnant and gave birth to a daughter
of remarkable beauty, whom she named Habren.
Guendoloena also became pregnant and bore a boy,
to whom was given the name Maddan.
This boy was given to his grandfather Corineus to learn his lessons.

After Corineus finally died,
Locrinus deserted Guendoloena and elevated Estrildis to be queen.
And so Guendoloena, angry beyond measure, 
went to Cornwall and assembled all the young men of that kingdom
and began harassing Locrinus.
In the end, when both armies had been mustered,
they joined battle near the River Stour,
where Locrinus was struck by an arrow and lost the joys of life.
======================================================================

Perempto igitur illo, cepit Guendoloena regni gubernaculum,
paterna insania furens.
Iubet enim Estrildidem et filiam eius Habren praecipitari in fluuium
qui nunc Sabrina dicitur fecitque edictum per totam Britanniam
ut flumen nomine puellae uocaretur;
uolebat etenim honorem aeternitatis illi impendere quia maritus suus eam generauerat.
Vnde contigit quod usque in hunc diem appellatum est flumen Britannica lingua
Habren, quod per corruptionem nominis alia lingua Sabrina uocatur.

Regnauit deinde Guendoloena .xv. annis post interfectionem Locrini,
qui decem annis regnauerat;
et cum uidisset Maddan filium suum aetate adultum,
sceptro regni insigniuit illum,
contenta regione Cornubiae dum reliquum uitae deduceret.
Tunc Samuel propheta regnabat in Iudaea et
Silutus Aeneas uiuebat adhuc et Omerus clarus rethor et poeta habebatur.
======================================================================
And so, once he'd been killed, Guendoloena took control of the kingdon,
raging with the insanity of her father.
For she ordered that Estrildida and her daughter Habren be cast into the river
that is now called the Severn, and she made an edict through all of Britain
that the river should be called after the girl's name;
for she wished eternal honor to be expended to her,
because her own husband had produced her.
From this it happened that up to this day the river is called Habren in the
British language, but was corrupted to Severn in the other language. 

Then Guendoloena ruled for 15 years after the killing of Locrinus,
who had ruled for ten years;
and when she saw that her son Madden was an adult in age,
she distinguished him with the scepter of royal power,
content with the region of Cornwall while she spent the remainder of her life.
At that time the prophet Samuel was ruling in Judea
and Silutus Aeneas was still alive and Homer was held a famous writer and poet.
======================================================================

Insignitus igitur Maddan uxore ex illa genuit duos filios,
Mempricium et Malim,
regnumque cum pace et diligentia quadraginta annis tractauit.
Quo defuncto, discordia orta est inter praedictos fratres propter regnum,
quia uterque totam insulam possidere aestuabat.
Mempricius ergo, affectum suum perficere desiderans,
colloquium iniuit cum Mali quasi concordiam facturus,
sed taeda proditionis inflammatus ipsum inter prolocutores interfecit.
Deinde, regimen tocius insulae nactus,
tantam tyrannidem exercuit in populum quod fere quemque nobilissimum perimebat.
Sed et totam progeniem suam exosus quemcumque sibi in regno posse succedere
timebat uel ui vel proditione opprimebat.
Relicta etiam propria uxore sua, ex qua inclitum iuuenem Ebraucum progenuerat,
sese sodomitanae uoluptati dedit,
non naturalem uenerem naturali libidini praeferens.
======================================================================
And so the distinguished Maddan had two sons, Mempricius and Malim,
with his wife and managed the kingdom with peace and love for forty years.
After he died, discord over the kingdom sprang up between the brothers,
since each one was hot to seize the entire island.
Therefore Mempricius, desiring to carry out his passion,
began a parley with Malim as if to come to an agreement,
but burning with the torch of treason, killed him among the advocates.
Then, having gained control of the entire island,
he exercised such tyranny against the people that he killed nearly every noble.
Hating even his own family, he feared anyone in the kingdom who might succeed
him and crushed them through either force or treachery.
He even abandoned his own wife, who had given birth to the renowned youth
Ebraucus, and gave himself over to the delight of Sodom,
preferring unnatural sex to natural passion.
======================================================================

Vigesimo tandem regni sui anno, dum uenationem faceret,
secessit a sociis suis in quandam conuallem,
ubi a multitudine rabiosorum luporum circundatus miserrime deuoratus est.
Tunc Saul regnabat in Iudaea et Euristeus in Lacedaemonia.
Defuncto itaque Mempricio, Ebraucus filius suus,
uir magnae staturae et mirae fortitudinis,
regimen Britanniae suscepit et triginta nouem annis tenuit.
Hic primus post Brutum classem in partes Galliarum duxit
et illato proelio affecit prouincias caede uirorum atque urbium oppressione
infinitaque auri et argenti copia ditatus cum uictoria reuersus est.
Deinde trans Humbrum condidit ciuitatem,
quam de nomine suo uocauit Kaerebrauc, id est ciuitas Ebrauci.
Et tunc Dauid rex regnabat in Iudaea et Siluius Latinus in Italia
et Gad Nathan et Asaph prophetabant in Israel.
Condidit etiam Ebraucus urbem Aldclud uersus Albaniam et oppidum Montis Agned,
quod nunc Castellum Puellarum dicitur, et Montem Dolorosum.
======================================================================
At last, in the twentieth year of his reign, while he was out hunting,
he withdrew from his companions into a certain valley,
where he was surrounded and wretchedly devoured by a pack of ravening wolves.
At this time Saul was ruling in Judea and Euristeus in Sparta.
And so, once Mempricius was dead, his son Ebraucus,
a man of great stature and remarkable strength,
took control of Britain and held it for thirty-nine years.
He was the first after Brutus to lead a fleet into Gaulish regions.
When battle was joined he afflicted the provinces with the destruction
of people and cities by force and then returned victorious,
enriched with boundless wealth of gold and silver.
Then he founded a city on the far side of the Humber,
which he named 'Karerebrauc', that is, the city of Ebraucus, after himself.
At this time King David reigned in Judea and Siluius Latinus in Italy
and Gad, Nathan and Asaph were prophesying in Israel.
Also, Ebraucus founded the city of Dumbarton, towards Scotland,
and the town of Mount Agned, which is now called Edinburgh, and Mount Sorrowful.
======================================================================

Genuit etiam .xx. filios ex uiginti coniugibus quas habebat nec non 
et .xxx. filias regnumque Britanniae .lx. annis fortissime tractauit.
Erant autem nomina filiorum eius Brutus Viride Scutum, Margadud, Sisillius,
Regin, Moruid, Bladud, Iagon, Bodloan, Kincar, Spaden, Gaul, Dardan,
Eldad, Iuor, Cangu, Hector, Kerin, Rud, Assarach, Buel; nomina autem
filiarum Gloigin, Innogin, Oudas, Guenlian, Gaurdid, Angarad, Guenlodee,
Tangustel, Gorgon, Medlan, Methahel, Ourar, Mailure, Kambreda, Ragan,
Gaei, Ecub, Nest, Chein, Stadud, Gladus, Ebrein, Blangan, Aballac,
Angaes, Galaes (omnium pulcherrima quae tunc in Britannia siue in Gallia
fuerant), Edra, Anor, Stadiald, Egron. Has omnes direxit pater in Italiam
ad Siluium Albam, qui post Siluium Latinum regnabat. Fuerunt ibi maritatae
nobilioribus Troianis, quorum cubilia et Latinae et Sabinae diffugiebant.
At filii duce Assaraco fratre duxerunt classem in Germaniam et auxilio
Siluii Albae usi subiugato populo adepti sunt regnum.
======================================================================
He also begat 20 sons from the twenty consorts that he had and 
30 daughters as well and managed the kingdom of Britain firmly for 60 years.
Now the names of his sons were Brutus Green Shield, Margadud, Sisillius,
Regin, Moruid, Bladud, Iagon, Bodloan, Kincar, Spaden, Gaul, Dardan,
Eldad, Iuor, Cangu, Hector, Kerin, Rud, Assarach and Buel.  The names
of his daughters were Gloigin, Innogin, Oudas, Guenlian, Gaurdid, Angarad,
Guenlodee, Tangustel, Gorgon, Medlan, Methahel, Ourar, Mailure, Kambreda,
Ragan, Gaei, Ecub, Nest, Chein, Stadud, Gladus, Ebrein, Blangan, Aballac,
Angaes, Galaes (who were at that time the most beautiful of all in Britain
or Gaul) Edra, Anor, Stadiald, and Egron. Their father sent them all to Italy,
to Silvius Alba, who reigned after Silvius Latinus.
They were there given in marriage to well-born Trojans,
whose beds were rejected by both Latin and Sabine women.
But his sons, with their brother Assaracus leading, took ship to Germany and,
with Silvius Alba's aid, subjugated the people and gained the kingdom.

======================================================================
