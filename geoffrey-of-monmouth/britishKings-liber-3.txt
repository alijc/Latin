LIBER III

Exin duo filii eius, Beli uidelicet et Brennius,
in regnum succedere uolentes maxima contriti sunt discordia.
Contendebant enim quis eorum diademate regni insigniretur.
Cum itaque plures decertationes inter se commiscuissent,
interfuerunt amici utrorumque, qui ipsos in concordiam reduxerunt.
Censuerunt quoque regnum inter eos ea conditione diuidendum esse
ut Belinus diadema insulae cum Loegria atque Kambria
nec non et Cornubia possideret;
erat enim primogenitus,
petebatque Troiana consuetudo ut dignitas hereditatis ei proueniret.
At Brennius, quoniam iunior fuerat,
fratri subditus Northamhimbriam ab Humbro usque ad Katanesiam adeptus est.
Confirmato igitur super his pactionibus foedere,
tractauerunt patriam per quinquennium cum pace et iusticia.
Sed quia discordia sese prosperis rebus semper miscere conatur,
affuerunt quidam fabricatores mendacii qui ad Brennium accesserunt dicentes:

 'Vt quid ignauia te tantum occupauit ut Belino subiectionem teneas,
  cum idem pater et mater eademque nobilitas te ei parificet?
========================================
Then, his two sons, that is, Beli and Brennius,
both wished to succeed to the throne and were worn out with great discord.
For they contended which of them should be distinguished with the royal crown.
And so, after they'd had many disputes between themselves,
their mutual friends intervened, and guided them back into harmony.
Also, they decided to divide the kingdom between them with the agreement 
that Belinus, the first-born,
hold the crown of the island with Loegria and Wales and also Cornwall;
and Trojan custom demanded that the honor of inheritance be provided to him.
But Brennius, since he was younger, submitted to his brother and secured
Northumbria from the Humber to Caithness. 
Therefore, by a treaty confirmed upon these agreements,
they managed their native land for five years with peace and justice.
But since discord always tries to mix itself up in prosperous matters,
certain lie-makers appeared, who approached Brennius and said:

 'Why has faintheartedness so seized you that you submit to Belinus,
  when the same father and mother and the same nobility made you his equal.
========================================

  Adde quod in pluribus debellationibus expertus es,
  qui tociens Cheulfo duci Morianorum in prouinciam nostram applicanti
  resistere potuisti ipsumque ex regno tuo fugare.
  Rumpe foedus quod tibi dedecori est et duc filiam
  Elsingii regis Norguegensium, ut ipsius auxilio amissam dignitatem recipias'.

Postquam igitur his et pluribus aliis animum iuuenis corruperunt,
adquieuit ipse adiuitque Norguegiam duxitque filiam regis
ut a praedictis adulatoribus edoctus fuerat.
========================================
  Add to that that you have been proved in many battles,
  you who could so often stand up to Cheulfus, the duke of the Morianians,
  when he landed in our province, and put him to flight from your kingdom.
  Break the treaty that is a disgrace to you and wed the daughter
  of Elsingius, the king of the Norwegians,
  so that you might recover your lost rank with his aid.

And so after the young men corrupted his mind with these and many other words,
he assented and visited Norway and wed the daughter of the king,
as he'd been instructed by the aforesaid flatterers.
========================================

Interea, cum id fratri nunciatum esset,
indignatus est quia sic sine licentia sua et contra ipsum egisset.
Petiuit itaque Northamhimbriam cepitque comprouincialium ciuitates et eas
custodibus suis muniuit.
Porro Brennius, audito rumore qui actum fratris notificauerat,
adducit secum magnam copiam Norguegensium paratoque nauigio redit in Britanniam.
Cumque aequora securius et prospero uento sulcaret,
obuiauit ei Guichtlacus rex Dacorum, qui ipsum insecutus fuerat;
aestuauerat namque amore puellae quam Brennius duxerat,
unde ultra modum dolens classem parauerat et exercitum
ipsumque citissimis uelis sequebatur.
Nauali igitur aggressu facto,
cepit forte nauem qua praedicta puella fuerat
illatisque uncis illam inter consocios attraxit.

Illis autem hinc et inde infra profundum congredientibus,

========================================
Meanwhile, after this had been reported to his brother, he was indignant,
because he acted so without his permission and against his person. 
And so he attacked Northumbria and seized its provincial cities
and garrisoned them with his own men.
After Brennius heard a rumor about his brother's actions, he readied a ship
and returned to Britain, bringing a host of Norwegians with him.
And while he plowed the main, secure with a favorable wind,
he was met by Guichtlacus, the king of the Danes, who had been following him;
for he boiled with love for the lass that Brennius had married,
and hurt beyond measure hurt from this, he had prepared ships and an army
and was pursuing him with swift sails.
And so, when the naval assault commenced,
by chance he captured the ship on which the aforesaid lass was
and dragged it in among his companions with grappling hooks.
