LIBER III

Exin duo filii eius, Beli uidelicet et Brennius,
in regnum succedere uolentes maxima contriti sunt discordia.
Contendebant enim quis eorum diademate regni insigniretur.
Cum itaque plures decertationes inter se commiscuissent,
interfuerunt amici utrorumque, qui ipsos in concordiam reduxerunt.
Censuerunt quoque regnum inter eos ea conditione diuidendum esse
ut Belinus diadema insulae cum Loegria atque Kambria
nec non et Cornubia possideret;
erat enim primogenitus,
petebatque Troiana consuetudo ut dignitas hereditatis ei proueniret.
At Brennius, quoniam iunior fuerat,
fratri subditus Northamhimbriam ab Humbro usque ad Katanesiam adeptus est.
Confirmato igitur super his pactionibus foedere,
tractauerunt patriam per quinquennium cum pace et iusticia.
Sed quia discordia sese prosperis rebus semper miscere conatur,
affuerunt quidam fabricatores mendacii qui ad Brennium accesserunt dicentes:

 'Vt quid ignauia te tantum occupauit ut Belino subiectionem teneas,
  cum idem pater et mater eademque nobilitas te ei parificet?
========================================
Then, his two sons, that is, Beli and Brennius,
both wished to succeed to the throne and were worn out with great discord.
For they contended which of them should be distinguished with the royal crown.
And so, after they'd had many disputes between themselves,
their mutual friends intervened, and guided them back into harmony.
Also, they decided to divide the kingdom between them with the agreement 
that Belinus, the first-born,
hold the crown of the island with Loegria and Wales and also Cornwall;
and Trojan custom demanded that the honor of inheritance be provided to him.
But Brennius, since he was younger, submitted to his brother and secured
Northumbria from the Humber to Caithness. 
Therefore, by a treaty confirmed upon these agreements,
they managed their native land for five years with peace and justice.
But since discord always tries to mix itself up in prosperous matters,
certain lie-makers appeared, who approached Brennius and said:

 'Why has faintheartedness so seized you that you submit to Belinus,
  when the same father and mother and the same nobility made you his equal.
========================================

  Adde quod in pluribus debellationibus expertus es,
  qui tociens Cheulfo duci Morianorum in prouinciam nostram applicanti
  resistere potuisti ipsumque ex regno tuo fugare.
  Rumpe foedus quod tibi dedecori est et duc filiam
  Elsingii regis Norguegensium, ut ipsius auxilio amissam dignitatem recipias'.

Postquam igitur his et pluribus aliis animum iuuenis corruperunt,
adquieuit ipse adiuitque Norguegiam duxitque filiam regis
ut a praedictis adulatoribus edoctus fuerat.
========================================
  Add to that that you have been proved in many battles,
  you who could so often stand up to Cheulfus, the duke of the Morianians,
  when he landed in our province, and put him to flight from your kingdom.
  Break the treaty that is a disgrace to you and wed the daughter
  of Elsingius, the king of the Norwegians,
  so that you might recover your lost rank with his aid.

And so after the young men corrupted his mind with these and many other words,
he assented and visited Norway and wed the daughter of the king,
as he'd been instructed by the aforesaid flatterers.
========================================

Interea, cum id fratri nunciatum esset,
indignatus est quia sic sine licentia sua et contra ipsum egisset.
Petiuit itaque Northamhimbriam cepitque comprouincialium ciuitates et eas
custodibus suis muniuit.
Porro Brennius, audito rumore qui actum fratris notificauerat,
adducit secum magnam copiam Norguegensium paratoque nauigio redit in Britanniam.
Cumque aequora securius et prospero uento sulcaret,
obuiauit ei Guichtlacus rex Dacorum, qui ipsum insecutus fuerat;
aestuauerat namque amore puellae quam Brennius duxerat,
unde ultra modum dolens classem parauerat et exercitum
ipsumque citissimis uelis sequebatur.
Nauali igitur aggressu facto,
cepit forte nauem qua praedicta puella fuerat
illatisque uncis illam inter consocios attraxit.
========================================
Meanwhile, after this had been reported to his brother, he was indignant,
because he acted so without his permission and against his person. 
And so he attacked Northumbria and seized its provincial cities
and garrisoned them with his own men.
After Brennius heard a report on his brother's actions, he readied a ship
and returned to Britain, bringing a host of Norwegians with him.
And while he plowed the main, secure with a favorable wind,
he was met by Guichtlacus, the king of the Danes, who had been following him;
for he boiled with love for the lass that Brennius had married,
and hurt beyond measure hurt from this, he had prepared ships and an army
and was pursuing him with swift sails.
And so, when the naval assault commenced,
by chance he captured the ship on which the aforesaid lass was
and dragged it in among his companions with grappling hooks.
========================================

Illis autem hinc et inde infra profundum congredientibus,
ruunt ex inprouiso aduersi uenti factoque turbine naues dissipant,
dissipatas uero in diuersa littora compellunt.
Rex igitur Daciae inimica ui uentorum compulsus,
peracto quinque dierum cursu,
cum timore applicuit cum puella in Northamhimbriam,
nescius quam patriam inopinabilis euentus optulisset.
Cumque id a pagensibus compertum esset, ceperunt illos duxeruntque ad Belinum,
qui super maritima aduentum fratris expectabat.
Erant ibi cum naue Guichtlaci tres aliae naues,
quarum una fuerat ex Brennii nauigio.
Postquam autem quid essent regi indicauerunt,
gaudens admodum gauisus est id sibi contigisse dum sese in fratrem uindicare captaret.
========================================
But while they battle here and there upon the depths,
an adverse wind rushes in from nowhere and brings a whirlwind that
scatters the ships and forces them onto different shores.
And so the king of the Danes, driven by the hostile strength of the winds,
having completed the course of five days,
with dread landed in Northumbria, with the lass,
not knowing which country unexpected fate might have presented to him.
And after the Northumbrians learned of this,
they seized the Danes and brought them to Belinus,
who was waiting on the coast for his brothers' arrival.
There were three other ships there along with Guichtlacus',
one of which had been Brennius'.
But after they told the king what they were,
he was overjoyed that this had fallen to him
while he was attempting to avenge himself against his brother.
========================================

Emensis deinde aliquot diebus, ecce Brennius resociatis nauibus in Albaniam applicuit.
Exin, cum ei captio coniugis ceterorumque notificata fuisset
et quod frater sibi regnum Northamhimbriae dum aberat surripuisset,
misit nuncios suos ad eum mandauitque ut regnum et sponsa redderentur;
sin autem, testatur se totam insulam a mari usque ad mare uastaturum,
ipsum etiam fratrem interfecturum si copia congrediendi sibi praestaretur.
Quod cum Belinus sciuisset,
negauit plane quod petebat collectoque omni milite insulae uenit Albaniam,
contra illum pugnaturus.
At Brennius,
ut se sciuit repulsam passum fuisse germanumque hoc modo contra se uenire,
iuit in obuiam illi in nemore quod uocatur Calaterium ut cum eo congrederetur.
Vt igitur eundem nacti sunt campum,
diuiserunt uterque socios suos in turmas cominusque accedentes proeliari coeperunt.
======================================== 
Several days later, Brennius landed in Scotland with his ships reunited.
Then, after he'd learned of the loss of his wife and the others,
and that his brother had stolen the kingdom of Northumbria while he was absent,
he sent his envoys to him and ordered him to return his kingdom and his wife;
otherwise he swore to lay waste to the whole island, from sea to sea,
and to kill his brother if the opportunity to do battle were offered him.
And when Belinus came to know of this,
he categorically refused what he'd asked and marched on Scotland,
having mustered every knight in the island to fight him.
But as soon as Brennius knew that he'd been rebuffed and
that his brother was coming against him in this way,
he marched against him, to fight him in the forest called Calaterium.
And so as they met on the field of battle,
each broke his comrades up into troops, advanced, and began to fight.
======================================== 
Multum diei in bellando consumpserunt,
quia in utraque parte probissimi uiri dextras commiscebant.
Multum cruoris hinc et inde fuderunt,
quia tela ipsorum uiribus uibrata letifera uulnera ingerebant.
Concidebant inter corruentes cohortes uulnerati quemadmodum segetes
cum a falcatoribus aggrediuntur.
Denique, praeualentibus Britonibus,
diffugiunt Norguegenses laceratis agminibus ad naues;
et cum fugam facerent, insequitur illos Belinus, caedem sine pietate faciens.
Ceciderunt in illo proelio .xv. milia hominum,
nec ex residuis mille superfuerunt qui illaesi abscederent.
At Brennius, uix unam nauim nactus ut fortuna conduxerat,
Gallicana littora petiuit;
ceteri uero qui cum illo aduenerant quo casus ducebat latebras exigebant.
======================================== 
They spent much of the day in battle,
for on both sides highly skilled men mixed it up with their sword arms.
Gallons of blood poured out from either side,
as they forcibly thrust the spears they brandished into fatal wounds.
They died in the midst of toppling cohorts,
falling just like wheat attacked with sickles.
Finally, the Britons prevailed and
the Norwegians scattered in mangled streams to their ships;
and Belinus pursued them as they fled, making a pitiless slaughter.
They cut down 15,000 men in that battle,
and among the survivors not a thousand were left who got away uninjured.
Brennius just barely boarded a ship by a stroke of luck
and made for the shores of Gaul;
the rest of his men fled into hiding wherever chance led. 

======================================== 
Cum igitur Belino uictoria cessisset, conuocauit omnes regni proceres infra Eboracum, consilio ipsorum tractaturus quid de rege Dacorum
mot nomque sibi ex carcere qued sese regnumque Daciae
