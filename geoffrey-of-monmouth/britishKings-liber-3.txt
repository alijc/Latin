LIBER III

Exin duo filii eius, Beli uidelicet et Brennius,
in regnum succedere uolentes maxima contriti sunt discordia.
Contendebant enim quis eorum diademate regni insigniretur.
Cum itaque plures decertationes inter se commiscuissent,
interfuerunt amici utrorumque, qui ipsos in concordiam reduxerunt.
Censuerunt quoque regnum inter eos ea conditione diuidendum esse
ut Belinus diadema insulae cum Loegria atque Kambria
nec non et Cornubia possideret;
erat enim primogenitus,
petebatque Troiana consuetudo ut dignitas hereditatis ei proueniret.
At Brennius, quoniam iunior fuerat,
fratri subditus Northamhimbriam ab Humbro usque ad Katanesiam adeptus est.
Confirmato igitur super his pactionibus foedere,
tractauerunt patriam per quinquennium cum pace et iusticia.
Sed quia discordia sese prosperis rebus semper miscere conatur,
affuerunt quidam fabricatores mendacii qui ad Brennium accesserunt dicentes:

 'Vt quid ignauia te tantum occupauit ut Belino subiectionem teneas,
  cum idem pater et mater eademque nobilitas te ei parificet?
========================================
Then, his two sons, that is, Beli and Brennius,
both wished to succeed to the throne and were worn out with great discord.
For they contended which of them should be distinguished with the royal crown.
And so, after they'd had many disputes between themselves,
their mutual friends intervened, and guided them back into harmony.
Also, they decided to divide the kingdom between them with the agreement 
that Belinus, the first-born,
hold the crown of the island with Loegria and Wales and also Cornwall;
and Trojan custom demanded that the honor of inheritance be provided to him.
But Brennius, since he was younger, submitted to his brother and secured
Northumbria from the Humber to Caithness. 
Therefore, by a treaty confirmed upon these agreements,
they managed their native land for five years with peace and justice.
But since discord always tries to mix itself up in prosperous matters,
certain lie-makers appeared, who approached Brennius and said:

 'Why has faintheartedness so seized you that you submit to Belinus,
  when the same father and mother and the same nobility made you his equal.
========================================

  Adde quod in pluribus debellationibus expertus es,
  qui tociens Cheulfo duci Morianorum in prouinciam nostram applicanti
  resistere potuisti ipsumque ex regno tuo fugare.
  Rumpe foedus quod tibi dedecori est et duc filiam
  Elsingii regis Norguegensium, ut ipsius auxilio amissam dignitatem recipias'.

Postquam igitur his et pluribus aliis animum iuuenis corruperunt,
adquieuit ipse adiuitque Norguegiam duxitque filiam regis
ut a praedictis adulatoribus edoctus fuerat.
========================================
  Add to that that you have been proved in many battles,
  you who could so often stand up to Cheulfus, the duke of the Morianians,
  when he landed in our province, and put him to flight from your kingdom.
  Break the treaty that is a disgrace to you and wed the daughter
  of Elsingius, the king of the Norwegians,
  so that you might recover your lost rank with his aid.

And so after the young men corrupted his mind with these and many other words,
he assented and visited Norway and wed the daughter of the king,
as he'd been instructed by the aforesaid flatterers.
========================================

Interea, cum id fratri nunciatum esset,
indignatus est quia sic sine licentia sua et contra ipsum egisset.
Petiuit itaque Northamhimbriam cepitque comprouincialium ciuitates et eas
custodibus suis muniuit.
Porro Brennius, audito rumore qui actum fratris notificauerat,
adducit secum magnam copiam Norguegensium paratoque nauigio redit in Britanniam.
Cumque aequora securius et prospero uento sulcaret,
obuiauit ei Guichtlacus rex Dacorum, qui ipsum insecutus fuerat;
aestuauerat namque amore puellae quam Brennius duxerat,
unde ultra modum dolens classem parauerat et exercitum
ipsumque citissimis uelis sequebatur.
Nauali igitur aggressu facto,
cepit forte nauem qua praedicta puella fuerat
illatisque uncis illam inter consocios attraxit.
========================================
Meanwhile, after this had been reported to his brother, he was indignant,
because he acted so without his permission and against his person. 
And so he attacked Northumbria and seized its provincial cities
and garrisoned them with his own men.
After Brennius heard a report on his brother's actions, he readied a ship
and returned to Britain, bringing a host of Norwegians with him.
And while he plowed the main, secure with a favorable wind,
he was met by Guichtlacus, the king of the Danes, who had been following him;
for he boiled with love for the lass that Brennius had married,
and hurt beyond measure hurt from this, he had prepared ships and an army
and was pursuing him with swift sails.
And so, when the naval assault commenced,
by chance he captured the ship on which the aforesaid lass was
and dragged it in among his companions with grappling hooks.
========================================

Illis autem hinc et inde infra profundum congredientibus,
ruunt ex inprouiso aduersi uenti factoque turbine naues dissipant,
dissipatas uero in diuersa littora compellunt.
Rex igitur Daciae inimica ui uentorum compulsus,
peracto quinque dierum cursu,
cum timore applicuit cum puella in Northamhimbriam,
nescius quam patriam inopinabilis euentus optulisset.
Cumque id a pagensibus compertum esset, ceperunt illos duxeruntque ad Belinum,
qui super maritima aduentum fratris expectabat.
Erant ibi cum naue Guichtlaci tres aliae naues,
quarum una fuerat ex Brennii nauigio.
Postquam autem quid essent regi indicauerunt,
gaudens admodum gauisus est id sibi contigisse dum sese in fratrem uindicare captaret.
========================================
But while they battle here and there upon the depths,
an adverse wind rushes in from nowhere and brings a whirlwind that
scatters the ships and forces them onto different shores.
And so the king of the Danes, driven by the hostile strength of the winds,
having completed the course of five days,
with dread landed in Northumbria, with the lass,
not knowing which country unexpected fate might have presented to him.
And after the Northumbrians learned of this,
they seized the Danes and brought them to Belinus,
who was waiting on the coast for his brothers' arrival.
There were three other ships there along with Guichtlacus',
one of which had been Brennius'.
But after they told the king what they were,
he was overjoyed that this had fallen to him
while he was attempting to avenge himself against his brother.
========================================

Emensis deinde aliquot diebus, ecce Brennius resociatis nauibus in Albaniam applicuit.
Exin, cum ei captio coniugis ceterorumque notificata fuisset
et quod frater sibi regnum Northamhimbriae dum aberat surripuisset,
misit nuncios suos ad eum mandauitque ut regnum et sponsa redderentur;
sin autem, testatur se totam insulam a mari usque ad mare uastaturum,
ipsum etiam fratrem interfecturum si copia congrediendi sibi praestaretur.
Quod cum Belinus sciuisset,
negauit plane quod petebat collectoque omni milite insulae uenit Albaniam,
contra illum pugnaturus.
At Brennius,
ut se sciuit repulsam passum fuisse germanumque hoc modo contra se uenire,
iuit in obuiam illi in nemore quod uocatur Calaterium ut cum eo congrederetur.
Vt igitur eundem nacti sunt campum,
diuiserunt uterque socios suos in turmas cominusque accedentes proeliari coeperunt.
======================================== 
Several days later, Brennius landed in Scotland with his ships reunited.
Then, after he'd learned of the loss of his wife and the others,
and that his brother had stolen the kingdom of Northumbria while he was absent,
he sent his envoys to him and ordered him to return his kingdom and his wife;
otherwise he swore to lay waste to the whole island, from sea to sea,
and to kill his brother if the opportunity to do battle were offered him.
And when Belinus came to know of this,
he categorically refused what he'd asked and marched on Scotland,
having mustered every knight in the island to fight him.
But as soon as Brennius knew that he'd been rebuffed and
that his brother was coming against him in this way,
he marched against him, to fight him in the forest called Calaterium.
And so as they met on the field of battle,
each broke his comrades up into troops, advanced, and began to fight.
======================================== 
Multum diei in bellando consumpserunt,
quia in utraque parte probissimi uiri dextras commiscebant.
Multum cruoris hinc et inde fuderunt,
quia tela ipsorum uiribus uibrata letifera uulnera ingerebant.
Concidebant inter corruentes cohortes uulnerati quemadmodum segetes
cum a falcatoribus aggrediuntur.
Denique, praeualentibus Britonibus,
diffugiunt Norguegenses laceratis agminibus ad naues;
et cum fugam facerent, insequitur illos Belinus, caedem sine pietate faciens.
Ceciderunt in illo proelio .xv. milia hominum,
nec ex residuis mille superfuerunt qui illaesi abscederent.
At Brennius, uix unam nauim nactus ut fortuna conduxerat,
Gallicana littora petiuit;
ceteri uero qui cum illo aduenerant quo casus ducebat latebras exigebant.
======================================== 
They spent much of the day in battle,
for on both sides highly skilled men mixed it up with their sword arms.
Gallons of blood poured out from either side,
as they forcibly thrust the spears they brandished into fatal wounds.
They died in the midst of toppling cohorts,
falling just like wheat attacked with sickles.
Finally, the Britons prevailed and
the Norwegians scattered in mangled streams to their ships;
and Belinus pursued them as they fled, making a pitiless slaughter.
They cut down 15,000 men in that battle,
and among the survivors not a thousand were left who got away uninjured.
Brennius just barely boarded a ship by a stroke of luck
and made for the shores of Gaul;
the rest of his men fled into hiding wherever chance led. 

======================================== 

Cum igitur Belino uictoria cessisset,
conuocauit omnes regni proceres infra Eboracum,
consilio ipsorum tractaturus quid de rege Dacorum faceret;
mandauerat namque sibi ex carcere quod sese regnumque Daciae sibi submitteret,
tributum quoque singulis annis donaret, si cum amica sua liber sineretur abire.
Mandauit etiam quod pactum suum foedere iuramenti et obsidibus confirmaret.
Conuocatis ergo proceribus cum id indicatum fuisset, assensum praebuerunt cuncti
ut Belinus peticioni Guichtlaci cum praedicta conditione acquiesceret.
Acquieuit igitur ipse, et Guichtlacus ex carcere solutus cum amica sua in Daciam reuersus est.
======================================== 
And so, after victory was granted to Belinus,
he summoned all the nobles of the kingdom to York,
to take counsel with them on what to do about the king of the Danes;
for indeed he had sent word to him from prison
that he would submit himself and the kingdom of Denmark to him,
and also give a yearly tribute,
if he were allowed to go free with his sweetheart.
Also, he offered to confirm his agreement to a treaty with an oath and with hostages.
And so, when the nobles were assembled and this was declared,
they all gave their assent that Belinus should acquiesce to Guichtlacus'
petition with the aforesaid conditions.
And so he himself acquiesced, and Guichtlacus was released from prison
and returned to Denmark with his sweetheart.
======================================== 

Porro Belinus,
cum neminem sibi infra regnum Britanniae resistere animaduertisset,
totiusque insulae a mari usque ad mare potitus,
leges quas pater inuenerat confirmauit,
stabilem quoque iusticiam per regnum fieri praecepit.
Maxime autem indixit ut ciuitates et uiae quae ad ciuitates ducebant
eandem pacem quam Dunuallo statuerat haberent;
sed de uiis orta fuerat discordia,
quia nesciebatur quibus terminis definitae essent.
Rex igitur, omne ambiguum legi suae auferre uolens,
conuocauit omnes operarios totius insulae
iussitque uiam ex caemento et lapidibus fabricari
quae insulam in longitudinem a Cornubico mari usque ad Katanesium litus secaret
et ad ciuitates quae infra erant recto limite duceret.

Iussit etiam aliam fieri in latitudinem regni quae a Meneuia urbe,
quae super Demeticum mare sita est,
usque ad Portum Hamonis extensa ad urbes infra positas ducatum ostenderet,
alias quoque duas ab obliquo insulae quae ad ceteras ciuitates ducatum praestarent.
======================================== 
Then after Belinus observed that no-one in the kingdom of Britain was resisting
him, and that he was in control of the whole island from sea to sea,
he confirmed the laws that his father had contrived,
and also ordered a steadfast justice to be maintained throughout the kingdom.
He especially proclaimed that cities and the roads that led to them 
would hold the same peace that had been established by Dunuallus;
but a disagreement had arisen about the roads,
for their definite boundaries were unknown.
And so the king, wishing to remove every ambiguity to his law,
called together every laborer from the whole island and
ordered a road to be constructed from stones and mortar that
divided the island lengthways from the sea at Cornwall to the shore at Caithness
and that led, by a straight path, to the cities that were along it.
He ordered yet another to be constructed crossways in the kingdom,
from the city of St Davids, on the Irish Sea, to the port of Southamptom,
leading straight to the cities sited along it,
and two others diagonally across the island, leading to other cities.
========================================

Deinde sanciuit eas omni honore omnique dignitate iurisque sui esse praecepit
quod de illata super eas uiolentia uindicta sumeretur.
Siquis autem scire uoluerit omnia quae de ipsis statuerit,
legat Molmutinas leges, quas Gildas hystoricus de Britannico in Latinum,
rex uero Aluredus de Latino in Anglicum sermonem transtulit.

Belino autem regnum cum pace et tranquillitate regente, frater suus Brennius,
in Gallicano litore ut praedictum est appulsus, internis anxietatibus cruciatur,
ferebat enim grauiter sese expulsum ex patria esse
nec copiam reuertendi habere ut amissa dignitate frueretur.
Nescius ergo quid faceret, principes Galliae adiuit,
.xii. solummodo militibus comitatus.
Cumque infortunium suum singulis ostendisset
neque auxilium ab ullo impetrare quiuisset,
uenit tandem ad Seginum ducem Allobrogum et ab eo honorifice susceptus est.
========================================
Then he dedicated the roads with every honor and dignity and warned that,
by his oath, vengeance would be exacted for any violence inflicted upon them.
But if anyone wants to know all that about the laws that he established,
let him read the Molmutine laws,
which the historian Gildas translated from British into Latin,
and then King Alfred from Latin into English vernacular.

But while Belinus ruled the kingdom with peace and tranquility,
his brother Brennius landed on Gaul's shore, as was said above,
tormented with inner anxieties,
for he was deeply upset in being banished from his homeland
and had not the means for returning
to enjoy the position that he'd lost.
And so, not knowing what to do, he approached the chiefs of Gaul,
accompanied by a mere 12 soldiers.
And after he'd revealed his misfortune to each of them
and hadn't been able to obtain aid from any of them,
he came at last to Seginus, the duke of the Allobroges,
and was honorably received by him.
========================================

Morans autem apud ipsum,
accessit in tantam familiaritatem ducis
ita ut non esset alter in curia qui sibi praeferretur.
In omnibus namque negociis tum in pace tum in bello probitatem suam monstrabat
ita ut dux illum amore patris diligeret.
Erat etiam pulcher aspectu, procera et gracilia membra habens,
in uenatu uero ut decebat et in aucupatu edoctus.
Cum igitur in tantam amiciciam ducis incidisset,
statuit dux de eo ut unicam quam habebat filiam sibi maritali lege copularet.
Et si masculino deinceps sexu careret,
concedebat ei regnum Allobrogum post obitum suum cum filia possidendum;
si autem filius ei superueniret,
promittebat auxilium ut in regem Britanniae promoueretur. 
========================================
Now while he enjoyed the duke's hospitality,
he entered into such intimacy with him
that there was no one else at court who was preferred over him.
For in all his doings, now in peace, now in war, he showed his uprightness,
so that the duke esteemed him with a father's love.
He was also good-looking, with long and slender limbs,
as good in hunting as fit his station and well-taught in hawking.
Therefore, after he fell into such a friendship with the duke,
the duke set it up for him to join in matrimony with his only daughter.
And if the duke didn't end up with a masculine heir,
he would yield the rule over the Allobroges to him after his own death,
holding this along with his daughter;
but if a son fell to him, he promised aid to advance him as king of Britain.
========================================

Et non solum id a duce sed etiam ab omnibus sibi subditis heroibus appetebatur,
quia in tantam eorum amiciciam prouenerat.
Nec mora,
maritatur puella Brennio principesque patriae subduntur soliumque regni donatur.
Nec annus quo haec facta sunt integre emensus fuerat cum suprema dies ducis
adueniens ipsum ex hac uita rapuit.
Tunc Brennius principes patriae, quos prius amicicia illexerat,
obnoxios sibi facere non diffugit largiendo eis thesaurum ducis,
qui a tempore attauorum suorum reseruatus fuerat.
Et quod Allobroges pro maximo habebant, profusus erat in dandis cibis, nulli ianuam suam prohibens.
========================================
And this was sought not only by the duke but also by all of his subordinate
heroes, for he had prospered so in their friendship.
The lass was married to Brennius without delay and her father's principal men
were placed under him and a king's throne was presented to him.
And after that not an entire year had passed
before the duke's final day arrived and snatched him away from this life.
Then Brennius did not dispel to make his father's principal men,
who had earlier been enticed by friendship,
liable to himself by giving to them the duke's treasury,
which had been retained from the time of his great-great-great grandfathers.
And what the Allobrogians for greatest held, had been squandered in given
rations, barring his door to no man.




Attractis ergo quibusque in dilectionem suam, deliberauit apud se qualiter sese in Belinum fratrem suum uindicaret. Quod cum populo sibi subdito indicasset, assensum fecerunt cuncti ut cum illo irent ad quodcumque regnum ipsos conducere affectasset. Nec mora, collecto grandi exercitu foedus cum Gallis iniuit ut per prouincias eorum Britanniam cum tranquillitate adire sineretur. Exin, parato in litore Estrusensium nauigio, mare ingressus est secundisque uelis in insulam applicuit. Diuulgato igitur aduentu ipsius, Belinus frater, ascita totius regni iuuentute, obuiam perrexit, proelium cum illo commissurus. Sed cum hinc et inde statutae cohortes fere commisceri incepissent, accelerauit mater amborum, quae adhuc uiuebat, per dispositas turmas incedens. Erat nomen eius Tonwenna aestuabatque filium uidere quem multo tempore non aspexerat. Vt igitur tremulis gradibus locum quo ipse stabat nacta fuit, brachia collo eius iniecit, desiderata basia ingeminans. Nudatis quoque uberibus, illum in hunc modum affata est, sermonem impediente singultu:
========================================
