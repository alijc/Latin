LIBER III

Exin duo filii eius, Beli uidelicet et Brennius,
in regnum succedere uolentes maxima contriti sunt discordia.
Contendebant enim quis eorum diademate regni insigniretur.
Cum itaque plures decertationes inter se commiscuissent,
interfuerunt amici utrorumque, qui ipsos in concordiam reduxerunt.
Censuerunt quoque regnum inter eos ea conditione diuidendum esse
ut Belinus diadema insulae cum Loegria atque Kambria
nec non et Cornubia possideret;
erat enim primogenitus,
petebatque Troiana consuetudo ut dignitas hereditatis ei proueniret.
At Brennius, quoniam iunior fuerat,
fratri subditus Northamhimbriam ab Humbro usque ad Katanesiam adeptus est.
Confirmato igitur super his pactionibus foedere,
tractauerunt patriam per quinquennium cum pace et iusticia.
Sed quia discordia sese prosperis rebus semper miscere conatur,
affuerunt quidam fabricatores mendacii qui ad Brennium accesserunt dicentes:
========================================
Then, his two sons, that is, Beli and Brennius,
wished to succeed to the throne and were destroyed in a great civil war.
For they were contending which of them would be distinguished with the royal crown.
And so, after more conflicts between themselves had mixed up,
friends were present and either/both, who led them back into harmony.
Likewise, they judged the kingdom between them the agreement to divide
so that Belinus held the crown of the island with Loegria and Wales
and also Cornwall; for he was the first-born,
and asked in the Trojan custom that rank of inheritance to him be provided.
But Brennius, since he was younger,
submissive to his brother secured Northumbria from the Humber up to the Katanesia.
Therefore, by a treaty confirmed upon these agreements,
they managed their native land for five years with peace and justice.
But since discord always tries to mix itself up in prosperous matters,
certain lie-makers were nearby, who approached Brennius and said:


'Vt quid ignauia te tantum occupauit ut Belino subiectionem teneas, cum idem pater et mater eademque nobilitas te ei parificet? Adde quod in pluribus debellationibus expertus es, qui tociens Cheulfo duci Morianorum in prouinciam nostram applicanti resistere potuisti ipsumque ex regno tuo fugare. Rumpe foedus quod tibi dedecori est et duc filiam Elsingii regis Norguegensium, ut ipsius auxilio amissam dignitatem recipias'.
Postquam igitur his et pluribus aliis animum iuuenis corruperunt, adquieuit 2
giam duxitque filiam regis ut a praedictis adulatoribus
