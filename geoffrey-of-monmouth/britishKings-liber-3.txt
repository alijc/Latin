LIBER III

Exin duo filii eius, Beli uidelicet et Brennius,
in regnum succedere uolentes maxima contriti sunt discordia.
Contendebant enim quis eorum diademate regni insigniretur.
Cum itaque plures decertationes inter se commiscuissent,
interfuerunt amici utrorumque, qui ipsos in concordiam reduxerunt.
Censuerunt quoque regnum inter eos ea conditione diuidendum esse
ut Belinus diadema insulae cum Loegria atque Kambria
nec non et Cornubia possideret;
erat enim primogenitus,
petebatque Troiana consuetudo ut dignitas hereditatis ei proueniret.
At Brennius, quoniam iunior fuerat,
fratri subditus Northamhimbriam ab Humbro usque ad Katanesiam adeptus est.
Confirmato igitur super his pactionibus foedere,
tractauerunt patriam per quinquennium cum pace et iusticia.
Sed quia discordia sese prosperis rebus semper miscere conatur,
affuerunt quidam fabricatores mendacii qui ad Brennium accesserunt dicentes:

 'Vt quid ignauia te tantum occupauit ut Belino subiectionem teneas,
  cum idem pater et mater eademque nobilitas te ei parificet?
========================================
Then, his two sons, that is, Beli and Brennius,
both wished to succeed to the throne and were worn out with great discord.
For they contended which of them should be distinguished with the royal crown.
And so, after they'd had many disputes between themselves,
their mutual friends intervened, and guided them back into harmony.
Also, they decided to divide the kingdom between them with the agreement 
that Belinus, the first-born,
hold the crown of the island with Loegria and Wales and also Cornwall;
and Trojan custom demanded that the honor of inheritance be provided to him.
But Brennius, since he was younger, submitted to his brother and secured
Northumbria from the Humber to Caithness. 
Therefore, by a treaty confirmed upon these agreements,
they managed their native land for five years with peace and justice.
But since discord always tries to mix itself up in prosperous matters,
certain lie-makers appeared, who approached Brennius and said:

 'Why has faintheartedness so seized you that you submit to Belinus,
  when the same father and mother and the same nobility made you his equal.
========================================

  Adde quod in pluribus debellationibus expertus es,
  qui tociens Cheulfo duci Morianorum in prouinciam nostram applicanti
  resistere potuisti ipsumque ex regno tuo fugare.
  Rumpe foedus quod tibi dedecori est et duc filiam
  Elsingii regis Norguegensium, ut ipsius auxilio amissam dignitatem recipias'.

Postquam igitur his et pluribus aliis animum iuuenis corruperunt,
adquieuit ipse adiuitque Norguegiam duxitque filiam regis
ut a praedictis adulatoribus edoctus fuerat.
========================================
  Add to that that you have been proved in many battles,
  you who could so often stand up to Cheulfus, the duke of the Morianians,
  when he landed in our province, and put him to flight from your kingdom.
  Break the treaty that is a disgrace to you and wed the daughter
  of Elsingius, the king of the Norwegians,
  so that you might recover your lost rank with his aid.

And so after the young men corrupted his mind with these and many other words,
he assented and visited Norway and wed the daughter of the king,
as he'd been instructed by the aforesaid flatterers.
========================================

Interea, cum id fratri nunciatum esset,
indignatus est quia sic sine licentia sua et contra ipsum egisset.
Petiuit itaque Northamhimbriam cepitque comprouincialium ciuitates et eas
custodibus suis muniuit.
Porro Brennius, audito rumore qui actum fratris notificauerat,
adducit secum magnam copiam Norguegensium paratoque nauigio redit in Britanniam.
Cumque aequora securius et prospero uento sulcaret,
obuiauit ei Guichtlacus rex Dacorum, qui ipsum insecutus fuerat;
aestuauerat namque amore puellae quam Brennius duxerat,
unde ultra modum dolens classem parauerat et exercitum
ipsumque citissimis uelis sequebatur.
Nauali igitur aggressu facto,
cepit forte nauem qua praedicta puella fuerat
illatisque uncis illam inter consocios attraxit.
========================================
Meanwhile, after this had been reported to his brother, he was indignant,
because he acted so without his permission and against his person. 
And so he attacked Northumbria and seized its provincial cities
and garrisoned them with his own men.
After Brennius heard a report on his brother's actions, he readied a ship
and returned to Britain, bringing a host of Norwegians with him.
And while he plowed the main, secure with a favorable wind,
he was met by Guichtlacus, the king of the Danes, who had been following him;
for he boiled with love for the lass that Brennius had married,
and hurt beyond measure hurt from this, he had prepared ships and an army
and was pursuing him with swift sails.
And so, when the naval assault commenced,
by chance he captured the ship on which the aforesaid lass was
and dragged it in among his companions with grappling hooks.
========================================

Illis autem hinc et inde infra profundum congredientibus,
ruunt ex inprouiso aduersi uenti factoque turbine naues dissipant,
dissipatas uero in diuersa littora compellunt.
Rex igitur Daciae inimica ui uentorum compulsus,
peracto quinque dierum cursu,
cum timore applicuit cum puella in Northamhimbriam,
nescius quam patriam inopinabilis euentus optulisset.
Cumque id a pagensibus compertum esset, ceperunt illos duxeruntque ad Belinum,
qui super maritima aduentum fratris expectabat.
Erant ibi cum naue Guichtlaci tres aliae naues,
quarum una fuerat ex Brennii nauigio.
Postquam autem quid essent regi indicauerunt,
gaudens admodum gauisus est id sibi contigisse dum sese in fratrem uindicare captaret.
========================================
But while they battle here and there upon the depths,
an adverse wind rushes in from nowhere and brings a whirlwind that
scatters the ships and forces them onto different shores.
And so the king of the Danes, driven by the hostile strength of the winds,
having completed the course of five days,
with dread landed in Northumbria, with the lass,
not knowing which country unexpected fate might have presented to him.
And after the Northumbrians learned of this,
they seized the Danes and brought them to Belinus,
who was waiting on the coast for his brothers' arrival.
There were three other ships there along with Guichtlacus',
one of which had been Brennius'.
But after they told the king what they were,
he was overjoyed that this had fallen to him
while he was attempting to avenge himself against his brother.
========================================

Emensis deinde aliquot diebus, ecce Brennius resociatis nauibus in Albaniam applicuit.
Exin, cum ei captio coniugis ceterorumque notificata fuisset
et quod frater sibi regnum Northamhimbriae dum aberat surripuisset,
misit nuncios suos ad eum mandauitque ut regnum et sponsa redderentur;
sin autem, testatur se totam insulam a mari usque ad mare uastaturum,
ipsum etiam fratrem interfecturum si copia congrediendi sibi praestaretur.
Quod cum Belinus sciuisset,
negauit plane quod petebat collectoque omni milite insulae uenit Albaniam,
contra illum pugnaturus.
At Brennius,
ut se sciuit repulsam passum fuisse germanumque hoc modo contra se uenire,
iuit in obuiam illi in nemore quod uocatur Calaterium ut cum eo congrederetur.
Vt igitur eundem nacti sunt campum,
diuiserunt uterque socios suos in turmas cominusque accedentes proeliari coeperunt.
======================================== 
Several days later, Brennius landed in Scotland with his ships reunited.
Then, after he'd learned of the loss of his wife and the others,
and that his brother had stolen the kingdom of Northumbria while he was absent,
he sent his envoys to him and ordered him to return his kingdom and his wife;
otherwise he swore to lay waste to the whole island, from sea to sea,
and to kill his brother if the opportunity to do battle were offered him.
And when Belinus came to know of this,
he categorically refused what he'd asked and marched on Scotland,
having mustered every knight in the island to fight him.
But as soon as Brennius knew that he'd been rebuffed and
that his brother was coming against him in this way,
he marched against him, to fight him in the forest called Calaterium.
And so as they met on the field of battle,
each broke his comrades up into troops, advanced, and began to fight.
======================================== 
Multum diei in bellando consumpserunt,
quia in utraque parte probissimi uiri dextras commiscebant.
Multum cruoris hinc et inde fuderunt,
quia tela ipsorum uiribus uibrata letifera uulnera ingerebant.
Concidebant inter corruentes cohortes uulnerati quemadmodum segetes
cum a falcatoribus aggrediuntur.
Denique, praeualentibus Britonibus,
diffugiunt Norguegenses laceratis agminibus ad naues;
et cum fugam facerent, insequitur illos Belinus, caedem sine pietate faciens.
Ceciderunt in illo proelio .xv. milia hominum,
nec ex residuis mille superfuerunt qui illaesi abscederent.
At Brennius, uix unam nauim nactus ut fortuna conduxerat,
Gallicana littora petiuit;
ceteri uero qui cum illo aduenerant quo casus ducebat latebras exigebant.
======================================== 
They spent much of the day in battle,
for on both sides highly skilled men mixed it up with their sword arms.
Gallons of blood poured out from either side,
as they forcibly thrust the spears they brandished into fatal wounds.
They died in the midst of toppling cohorts,
falling just like wheat attacked with sickles.
Finally, the Britons prevailed and
the Norwegians scattered in mangled streams to their ships;
and Belinus pursued them as they fled, making a pitiless slaughter.
They cut down 15,000 men in that battle,
and among the survivors not a thousand were left who got away uninjured.
Brennius just barely boarded a ship by a stroke of luck
and made for the shores of Gaul;
the rest of his men fled into hiding wherever chance led. 

======================================== 

Cum igitur Belino uictoria cessisset,
conuocauit omnes regni proceres infra Eboracum,
consilio ipsorum tractaturus quid de rege Dacorum faceret;
mandauerat namque sibi ex carcere quod sese regnumque Daciae sibi submitteret,
tributum quoque singulis annis donaret, si cum amica sua liber sineretur abire.
Mandauit etiam quod pactum suum foedere iuramenti et obsidibus confirmaret.
Conuocatis ergo proceribus cum id indicatum fuisset, assensum praebuerunt cuncti
ut Belinus peticioni Guichtlaci cum praedicta conditione acquiesceret.
Acquieuit igitur ipse, et Guichtlacus ex carcere solutus cum amica sua in Daciam reuersus est.
======================================== 
And so, after victory was granted to Belinus,
he summoned all the nobles of the kingdom to York,
to take counsel with them on what to do about the king of the Danes;
for indeed he had sent word to him from prison
that he would submit himself and the kingdom of Denmark to him,
and also give a yearly tribute,
if he were allowed to go free with his sweetheart.
Also, he offered to confirm his agreement to a treaty with an oath and with hostages.
And so, when the nobles were assembled and this was declared,
they all gave their assent that Belinus should acquiesce to Guichtlacus'
petition with the aforesaid conditions.
And so he himself acquiesced, and Guichtlacus was released from prison
and returned to Denmark with his sweetheart.
======================================== 

Porro Belinus,
cum neminem sibi infra regnum Britanniae resistere animaduertisset,
totiusque insulae a mari usque ad mare potitus,
leges quas pater inuenerat confirmauit,
stabilem quoque iusticiam per regnum fieri praecepit.
Maxime autem indixit ut ciuitates et uiae quae ad ciuitates ducebant
eandem pacem quam Dunuallo statuerat haberent;
sed de uiis orta fuerat discordia,
quia nesciebatur quibus terminis definitae essent.
Rex igitur, omne ambiguum legi suae auferre uolens,
conuocauit omnes operarios totius insulae
iussitque uiam ex caemento et lapidibus fabricari
quae insulam in longitudinem a Cornubico mari usque ad Katanesium litus secaret
et ad ciuitates quae infra erant recto limite duceret.

Iussit etiam aliam fieri in latitudinem regni quae a Meneuia urbe,
quae super Demeticum mare sita est,
usque ad Portum Hamonis extensa ad urbes infra positas ducatum ostenderet,
alias quoque duas ab obliquo insulae quae ad ceteras ciuitates ducatum praestarent.
======================================== 
Then after Belinus observed that no-one in the kingdom of Britain was resisting
him, and that he was in control of the whole island from sea to sea,
he confirmed the laws that his father had contrived,
and also ordered a steadfast justice to be maintained throughout the kingdom.
He especially proclaimed that cities and the roads that led to them 
would hold the same peace that had been established by Dunuallus;
but a disagreement had arisen about the roads,
for their definite boundaries were unknown.
And so the king, wishing to remove every ambiguity to his law,
called together every laborer from the whole island and
ordered a road to be constructed from stones and mortar that
divided the island lengthways from the sea at Cornwall to the shore at Caithness
and that led, by a straight path, to the cities that were along it.
He ordered yet another to be constructed crossways in the kingdom,
from the city of St Davids, on the Irish Sea, to the port of Southamptom,
leading straight to the cities sited along it,
and two others diagonally across the island, leading to other cities.
========================================

Deinde sanciuit eas omni honore omnique dignitate iurisque sui esse praecepit
quod de illata super eas uiolentia uindicta sumeretur.
Siquis autem scire uoluerit omnia quae de ipsis statuerit,
legat Molmutinas leges, quas Gildas hystoricus de Britannico in Latinum,
rex uero Aluredus de Latino in Anglicum sermonem transtulit.

Belino autem regnum cum pace et tranquillitate regente, frater suus Brennius,
in Gallicano litore ut praedictum est appulsus, internis anxietatibus cruciatur,
ferebat enim grauiter sese expulsum ex patria esse
nec copiam reuertendi habere ut amissa dignitate frueretur.
Nescius ergo quid faceret, principes Galliae adiuit,
.xii. solummodo militibus comitatus.
Cumque infortunium suum singulis ostendisset
neque auxilium ab ullo impetrare quiuisset,
uenit tandem ad Seginum ducem Allobrogum et ab eo honorifice susceptus est.
========================================
Then he dedicated the roads with every honor and dignity and warned that,
by his oath, vengeance would be exacted for any violence inflicted upon them.
But if anyone wants to know all that about the laws that he established,
let him read the Molmutine laws,
which the historian Gildas translated from British into Latin,
and then King Alfred from Latin into English vernacular.

But while Belinus ruled the kingdom with peace and tranquility,
his brother Brennius landed on Gaul's shore, as was said above,
tormented with inner anxieties,
for he was deeply upset in being banished from his homeland
and had not the means for returning
to enjoy the position that he'd lost.
And so, not knowing what to do, he approached the chiefs of Gaul,
accompanied by a mere 12 soldiers.
And after he'd revealed his misfortune to each of them
and hadn't been able to obtain aid from any of them,
he came at last to Seginus, the duke of the Allobroges,
and was honorably received by him.
========================================

Morans autem apud ipsum,
accessit in tantam familiaritatem ducis
ita ut non esset alter in curia qui sibi praeferretur.
In omnibus namque negociis tum in pace tum in bello probitatem suam monstrabat
ita ut dux illum amore patris diligeret.
Erat etiam pulcher aspectu, procera et gracilia membra habens,
in uenatu uero ut decebat et in aucupatu edoctus.
Cum igitur in tantam amiciciam ducis incidisset,
statuit dux de eo ut unicam quam habebat filiam sibi maritali lege copularet.
Et si masculino deinceps sexu careret,
concedebat ei regnum Allobrogum post obitum suum cum filia possidendum;
si autem filius ei superueniret,
promittebat auxilium ut in regem Britanniae promoueretur. 
========================================
Now while he enjoyed the duke's hospitality,
he entered into such intimacy with him
that there was no one else at court who was preferred over him.
For in all his doings, now in peace, now in war, he showed his uprightness,
so that the duke esteemed him with a father's love.
He was also good-looking, with long and slender limbs,
as good in hunting as fit his station and well-taught in hawking.
Therefore, after he fell into such a friendship with the duke,
the duke set it up for him to join in matrimony with his only daughter.
And if the duke didn't end up with a masculine heir,
he would yield the rule over the Allobroges to him after his own death,
holding this along with his daughter;
but if a son fell to him, he promised aid to advance him as king of Britain.
========================================

Et non solum id a duce sed etiam ab omnibus sibi subditis heroibus appetebatur,
quia in tantam eorum amiciciam prouenerat.
Nec mora,
maritatur puella Brennio principesque patriae subduntur soliumque regni donatur.
Nec annus quo haec facta sunt integre emensus fuerat cum suprema dies ducis
adueniens ipsum ex hac uita rapuit.
Tunc Brennius principes patriae, quos prius amicicia illexerat,
obnoxios sibi facere non diffugit largiendo eis thesaurum ducis,
qui a tempore attauorum suorum reseruatus fuerat.
Et quod Allobroges pro maximo habebant, profusus erat in dandis cibis, nulli ianuam suam prohibens.
========================================
And this was sought not only by the duke but also by all of his subordinates,
for he had so prospered in their friendship.
The lass was married to Brennius without delay and her father's principal men
were placed under him and a king's throne was presented to him.
And after that not a whole year had passed
before the duke's final day arrived and snatched him away from this life.
Then Brennius did not hesitate to make his father's principal men,
who had earlier been enticed by friendship,
beholden to himself by giving them the duke's treasury,
which had been retained from the time of his great-great-great grandfathers.
And what the Allobrogians held best, he poured out in giving feasts.
barring his door to no man.
========================================

Attractis ergo quibusque in dilectionem suam,
deliberauit apud se qualiter sese in Belinum fratrem suum uindicaret.
Quod cum populo sibi subdito indicasset,
assensum fecerunt cuncti ut cum illo irent ad quodcumque regnum ipsos conducere
affectasset.
Nec mora, collecto grandi exercitu foedus cum Gallis iniuit
ut per prouincias eorum Britanniam cum tranquillitate adire sineretur.
Exin, parato in litore Estrusensium nauigio,
mare ingressus est secundisque uelis in insulam applicuit.
Diuulgato igitur aduentu ipsius, Belinus frater,
ascita totius regni iuuentute, obuiam perrexit, proelium cum illo commissurus.
Sed cum hinc et inde statutae cohortes fere commisceri incepissent,
accelerauit mater amborum, quae adhuc uiuebat, per dispositas turmas incedens.
Erat nomen eius Tonwenna aestuabatque filium uidere quem multo tempore non
aspexerat.
Vt igitur tremulis gradibus locum quo ipse stabat nacta fuit,
brachia collo eius iniecit, desiderata basia ingeminans.
Nudatis quoque uberibus, illum in hunc modum affata est, sermonem impediente singultu:
========================================
And so, after drawing them into his goodwill,
he deliberated how he might avenge himself on his brother Belinus.
After he revealed this to his new vassals, they all agreed to assemble and march
with him against whichever kingdom he laid claim to. 
After mustering a great army, he immediately made a treaty with the Gauls,
that allowed him to pass peaceably through their provinces to approach Britain.
After that, he readied a fleet on the shore of Normandy,
set sail with favorable winds and landed on the island.
And so, with his arrival newsed abroad, his brother Belinus
took in all the young men of the realm and proceeded against him to do battle.
But when the arrayed cohorts were on the verge of meeting,
the still living mother of both sons rushed in, passing through the ranks.
Her name was Tonwenna and she burned to see the son whom she had not beheld
for a long time.
And so, as she, with trembling steps, reached the spot where he stood,
she threw her arms around his neck, redoubling the kisses that she longed for.
Even laying bare her breasts, she addressed him in this way,
her speech hampered with sobs:
========================================

'Memento, fili, memento uberum istorum quae suxisti matrisque tuae uteri,
 quo te opifex rerum in hominem ex non homine creauit,
 unde te in mundum produxit angustiis mea uiscera cruciantibus.
 Anxietatum igitur quas pro te passa sum reminiscens,
 peticioni meae acquiesce fratrique tuo ueniam concede atque inceptam iram compesce.
 Nullam enim aduersus eum habere debes, qui tibi nullam contumeliam intulerit.
 Nam quod causaris te a natione tua per eum expulsum fuisse,
 si euentum rei diligentius intueri institeris,
 nullatenus reperies quod iniusticiam uocabis.
 Non enim fugauit te ut deterius tibi contingeret sed coegit deteriora
 postponere ut ad potiora sublimareris.
 Subditus namque illi partem regni possidebas.
 Quam ut amisisti, par sibi factus es Allobrogum regnum adeptus.
 Quid igitur fecit nisi quod te ex paupere regulo in sublimem regem promouit?
 Adde quod discidium inter uos ortum non per ipsum sed per te inceptum fuit,
 qui auxilio regis Norguegiae fretus in ipsum exurgere aestuaueras'.
========================================
'Remember, son, remember these breasts which you suckled and your mother's womb,
 where the maker of things fashioned you into a human being,
 whence he brought you into the world through torturous labor pains.
 Therefore, remembering the worries that I have suffered for your sake,
 acquiesce to my petition and pardon your brother and curb your rage.
 For you should hold nothing against one who has imposed no indignity on you.
 You claim that he drove you out of your country,
 but if you stop to consider the outcome of the matter more carefully,
 you will discover nothing at all that you might call injustice.
 For he did not put you to flight to demean you, but forced you to set
 aside inferior things so that you might be raised higher. 
 For you held part of the kingdom as his subordinate.  When you lost it,
 you became his equal when you gained the kingdom of the Allobrogians.
 And so, what did he do but promote you from a poor princeling to a lofty king?
 Add to that that it was not he who started the discord between you, but you,
 who, relying on the aid of the King of Norway, had burned to rise against him.'
========================================

Super his igitur quae ipsa cum fletu expresserat motus,
sedato animo oboediuit et ultro deposita galea cum illa ad fratrem perrexit.
Belinus ergo, ut illum cum uultu pacis ad se uenire calluit,
abiectis armis in amplexus eiusdem cum osculo cucurrit.
Nec mora,
amici facti sunt adinuicem et cohortibus exarmatis urbem Trinouantum uenerunt.
Ibi consilio coepto quid facerent parauerunt exercitum communem in Galliarum partes ducere cunctasque prouincias potestati suae submittere.

Emenso deinde anno, transfretauerunt ad Gallias patriamque uastare coeperunt.
Quod cum per nationes diuulgatum esset,
conuenerunt omnes reguli Francorum obuiamque uenientes contra eos dimicauerunt.
At Belino et Brennio uictoria proueniente Franci uulneratis cateruis diffugierunt.
Mox Britones et Allobroges, ut triumpho potiti sunt, fugientes Gallos
insequi non cessauerunt donec captis regibus ipsos deditioni coegerunt.
Munitis etiam urbibus euersis, totum regnum infra unum annum submiserunt.
Postremo, cum uniuersas prouincias deditioni compulissent,
petierunt Romam cum tota multitudine sua urbesque et colonos per Italiam depopulant.
========================================
And so, moved by what she'd tearfully expressed, he obeyed her with a calm mind.
He voluntarily laid his helmet aside and proceeded with her to his brother.
Then Belinus, as he'd come to him with a peaceable face,
cast his weapons down and ran to embrace his brother with a kiss.
They became friends at once, disarmed their cohorts,
and went to the city of Trinovantum.
There they took council on what they should do, and readied an army in common
to lead into the regions of Gaul, to submit all the provinces to their power.

Then, after a year had passed, they crossed the sea to Gaul and began to lay
waste to the country.
And when that had been newsed abroad through the nations,
all the princes of the Franks came together to fight against them.
But when victory fell to Belinus and Brennius the Franks fled and scattered,
with their companies wounded.
Then, as the Britons and Allobrogians gained their victory,
they didn't leave off pursuing the fleeing Gauls until they cornered their kings
and forced them to surrender.
Likewise, they overthrew the fortified cities and subdued the whole kingdom
within a year.
At last, after they compelled all the provinces to surrender,
they attacked Rome with their entire host and sacked cities and colonies
throughout Italy.
========================================

Erant tunc Romae duo consules, Gabius et Porsenna,
quorum regimini patria commissa fuerat;
qui cum uidissent nullam gentem saeuitiae Belini atque Brennii resistere ualere,
assensu senatorum uenerunt ad illos, concordiam et amiciciam petentes.
Optulerunt etiam plurima donaria auri et argenti singulisque annis tributum
ut sua cum pace possidere sinerentur.
Sumptis igitur obsidibus,
ueniam donauerunt reges cohortesque suas in Germaniam duxerunt.
Cumque populum infestare institissent,
piguit Romanos praedicti foederis et reuocata audatia Germanis in auxilium
processerunt.
Quod cum regibus compertum esset, ultra modum id grauiter ferentes,
consilium inierunt quomodo utrumque populum oppugnarent.
Tanta namque multitudo Italorum superuenerat ita ut illis terrori essent.
========================================
At the time there were two consuls in Rome, Gabius and Porsenna,
who had been entrusted with steering the homeland.
After they'd seen that no nation could withstand the savagery of Belinus and
Brennius, they approached them, with the senators' approval,
to ask for concord and friendship.
They also offered great treasures of gold and silver as a yearly tribute
to allow them and theirs to be left in peace.
And so the kings consented and obtained hostages
and led their cohorts into Germany.
And when they threatened to molest that population, the Romans grew to dislike
the aforementioned treaty and, reviving their own courage,
proceeded to the assistance of the Germans.
Now when the kings found out about this, they took it hard, and
took counsel how to attack both nations.
For they were alarmed by the huge number of Italians that had arrived.
========================================

Consilio igitur habito, remansit Belinus cum Britonibus in Germania,
proelia hostibus illaturus, Brennius uero cum exercitibus suis Romam adiuit
ut ruptum foedus in Romanos uindicaret.
Id autem Itali scientes deseruerunt Germanos et Romam reuerti captantes iter
Brennii praecedere festinauerunt.
Belinus itaque, ut id sibi nunciatum fuerat,
reuocato exercitu praeterita nocte accelerauit quandamque uallem nactus qua
hostes praeterituri erant infra illam delituit
et aduentum illorum expectauit.
Sequenti deinde die instante, uenerunt Itali ad eundem locum,
coeptum iter facientes.
Et cum uallem armis hostium fulgere prospexissent,
confestim stupefacti arbitrati sunt Brennium Senonesque Gallos adesse.
Belinus ergo, compertis hostibus,
subito impetu irruptionem fecit in illos atque acriter inuasit.
Nec mora, Romani ex inprouiso occupati,
quia inermes et sine ordine incesserant, cum fuga campum deseruerunt;
quos Belinus sine pietate sequens trucidare non cessauit donec superueniente nocte inceptam stragem nequiuit perficere.
========================================
After holding this discussion, Belinus stayed with the Britons in Germany,
to fight with that enemy, while Brennius headed to Rome with his own
armies, to punish the Romans for breaking the treaty.
But the Italians learned of this and deserted the Germans.
They raced to return to Rome before Brennius could get there and cut him off.
When Belinus found out about this he called up his army and hastened off that very night.
He found a valley that the enemy would pass through and hid there, waiting for their arrival.
On the following day the Italians came to the same place, continuing their march.
And when they saw from a distance that the valley flashed with the enemy's arms,
they were stunned and at once assumed that it was Brennius and the Senones and Gauls.
As soon as Belinus discovered the enemy, he charged and fiercely attacked them.
The Romans were taken by surprise, for they'd marched with neither arms nor order,
and quickly deserted the field in flight.
Belinus pursued them without mercy, and didn't stop the slaughter until night
fell, keeping him from completing the massacre that he'd started.

========================================
Cum uictoria deinde Brennium petiuit, qui iam die tercio instante Romam obsidebat.
Vt igitur communem exercitum fecerunt,
inuadentes undique urbem moenia prosternere insistunt et
ut maiorem cladem ingererent erexerunt furcas ante portas ciuitatis obsessisque mandauerunt
quod obsides quos dederant in patibulo suspenderent nisi sese deditioni summitterent.
Verum Romani, in proposito suo perseuerantes,
despecta natorum et nepotum pietate, sese defendere intendunt;
nam quandoque machinationes eorum contrariis uel consimilibus machinationibus conterebant,
quandoque uero omnimodis telis ipsos a moenibus repellebant. 
========================================
With news of this victory he then hastened to Brennius,
who had already pressed Rome with a siege for three days.
Therefore they joined their armies and attacked the city from every side.
They worked at knocking down the walls and, in order to heap up greater carnage,
erected gallows in front of the gates of the city and
assured those besieged that their hostages would be hung 
unless they surrendered.
The Romans were truly steadfast in their purpose.
They disdained to pity their children and grandchildren and strained to defend themselves;
for sometimes they crushed the enemy siege engines with similar or dissimilar ones, 
and sometimes they repelled the enemy from the walls with every sort of projectile.
========================================

Cumque id conspexissent fratres, confestim proterua ignescentes ira
.xxiiii. nobilissimos obsidum in conspectu parentum suspendi praeceperunt.
Itaque Romani, proteruiores insistentes et freti legatione Gabii et Porsennae
consulum, qui ipsis mandauerant quod in auxilium eorum sequenti die uenirent,
urbem egredi statuerunt et cum hostibus proelia committere.
Et dum turmas suas sapienter distribuerent, ecce praedicti consules,
resociatis sociis qui dispersi fuerant, proeliaturi aduenerunt.
Densis autem agminibus incedentes,
ex inprouiso inuaserunt Allobroges et Britones.
Egressis quoque ciuibus consociati, stragem primo non minimam fecerunt.
Porro fratres, cum cladem commilitonum tam subito illatam inspexissent,
admodum anxiati socios coeperunt hortari atque in turmas resociare.
Crebras etiam irruptiones facientes, hostes retro cedere coegerunt.
Postremo, peremptis in utraque parte ad milia pugnantibus,
uictoria fratribus prouenit.
Interfecto etiam Gabio et capto Porsenna,
urbem ceperunt et absconditas conciuium opes commilitonibus dederunt.
========================================
And after the brothers saw this, at once kindled with a violent rage, they
ordered 24 of the most noble hostages to be hanged in their parents' sight.
And so the Romans, persevering in their recklessness and relying on
the consuls Gabius and Porsenna,
who had sent a message that they would come to their aid on the next day,
decided to sally forth from the city and do battle with the enemy.
And while they were drawing up their squadrons wisely, 
behold the aforementioned consuls arrived, ready to fight,
having reunited with the allies who had been dispersed.
Advancing in solid columns, they attacked the Allobrogians and Britons,
who were caught off-guard.
As their fellow-citizens had also marched out,
they at first made a slaughter that was not trivial.
Then, after the brothers saw the carnage suddenly inflicted on their troops,
they grew exceedingly anxious and began to urge on their allies and
form them back up into squadrons.
By making repeated assaults they forced the enemy to fall back.
At last, with thousands of fighting men killed on both sides,
the brothers gained the victory.
After Gabius was killed and Porsenna was captured,
they took the city and gave the wealth hidden by its citizens to their troops.
========================================

Habita ergo uictoria, remansit Brennius in Italia,
populum inaudita tyrannide afficiens;
cuius ceteros actus et exitum quia Romanae hystoriae declarant nequaquam
tractare curaui,
cum et nimiam prolixitatem huic operi ingessissem
et id quod alii tractauerunt perarans a proposito meo diuertissem.
Belinus uero in Britanniam reuersus est et cum tranquillitate reliquis uitae
suae diebus patriam tractauit.
Renouauit etiam aedificatas urbes ubicumque collapsae fuerant et multas nouas
aedificauit.
Inter ceteras composuit unam super Oscam flumen prope Sabrinum mare,
quae multis temporibus Kaerusc appellata metropolis Demetiae fuerat;
postquam autem Romani uenerunt, praefato nomine deleto uocata est Vrbs Legionum,
uocabulum trahens a Romanis legionibus quae ibidem hiemare solebant.
========================================
And so, once the victory had been gained, Brennius remained in Italy,
afflicting the populace with unheard of tyranny.
Since Roman histories reveal his other deeds and death
I wish to say no more about him,
after inserting such a long digression into this work
and veering from my intention, repeating what others have discussed.
Now Belinus returned to Britain and managed his country with tranquility for the
remaining days of his life.
Also, he restored the cities that had been erected wherever they'd falled into
ruin, and built many new ones.
Among others, he constructed one on the River Usk close to the Severn Sea,
that had been called Kaerusc, the capital of the Dyfed, for many years.
But after the Romans came, the aforesaid name was erased and it was called the
City of Legions, taking its name from the Roman Legions
that were wont to winter there.
========================================

Fecit etiam in urbe Trinouantum ianuam mirae fabricae super ripam Tamensis,
quam de nomine suo ciues temporibus istis Belinesgata uocant.
Desuper uero aedificauit turrim mirae magnitudinis portumque subtus ad pedem
applicantibus nauibus idoneum.
Leges patris ubique per regnum renouauit, constanti iusticiae indulgens.
In diebus igitur eius tanta copia diuiciarum populum refecit
quantam nec retro aetas habuisse testetur nec subsequens consecuta fuisse.
Postremo, cum supprema dies ipsum ex hac uita rapuisset,
combustum est corpus eius et puluis in aureo cado reconditus,
quem in urbe Trinouantum in summitate praedictae turris mira arte locauerunt.
========================================
He also built, on the bank of the Thames in the city of Trinovantum, a gate
of wondrous craft, that the citizens now call Billingsgate, after his name. 
He built a tower above it of wondrous size and a harbor down at its foot that
was suitable for ships to dock at.
He restored his father's laws throughout the kingdom, granting a stable justice.
And so in his day he replenished the populace with as much wealth
as had been seen before or afterwards.
Finally, after his last day snatched him from this life,
his body was cremated and his ashes laid in a golden urn,
which they very skillfully installed in the city of Trinovantum,
at the top of the aforesaid tower.
========================================

Exin successit ei Gurguint Barbtruc filius eiusdem, uir modestus et prudens,
qui per omnia paternos actus imitans pacem et iusticiam amabat.
Et cum uicini aduersus eum rebellabant,
audaciam exemplo genitoris reuocans proelia dira committebat
et hostes ad debitam subiectionem reducebat.
Inter plura alia contigit quod rex Dacorum,
qui diebus patris tributum eidem reddebat,
huic reddere diffugeret et ei debitam subiectionem denegaret;
quod ipse grauiter ferens duxit nauigium in Daciam
afflictoque dirissimis proeliis populo interfecit
regem patriamque pristino iugo subposuit.

Ea tempestate, cum post istam uictoriam domum per insulas Orcadum rediret,
inuenit .xxx. naues uiris et mulieribus plenas;
et cum causam aduentus eorum inquisiuisset, accessit ad ipsum dux illorum,
Partholoim nomine, et adorato eo ueniam et pacem rogauit.
========================================
After that he was succeeded by his son Gurguint Barbtruc, a reserved and prudent
man, who loved peace and justice, copying his father's deeds in all respects.
And when his neighbors rose up against him,
he, recalling the example of his father's boldness, engaged in dire battles
and reduced his enemy to the subjugation that they deserved.
Among many other things it happened that the king of the Danes,
who had paid tribute in his father's days,
forbore to pay it to him and denied him the submission he owed.
He was sorely vexed due to this, and led a fleet to Denmark
and overthrew the people with the most dreadful battles, killed
the king and placed the country under its former yoke.

In the time after that victory when he was returning home by way of the Orkney
islands, he discovered 30 ships filled with men and women;
and when he sought the reason for their arrival, their leader, named Partholoim,
approached and honored him, and requested pardon and peace.
========================================

Dicebat autem se ex partibus Hispaniarum expulsum fuisse
et maria illa circuire ut locum mansionis haberet.
Petebat etiam ab illo portiunculam Britanniae ad inhabitandam
ne odiosum iter maris diutius pererraret;
annus enim et dimidius iam emensus fuerat
ex quo a patria sua pulsus per occeanum cum sociis nauigauerat.
Vt igitur Gurguint Barbtruc et ipsos ex Hispania uenisse
et Basclenses uocatos esse et petitionem eorum edoctus fuit,
misit homines cum eis ad insulam Hiberniae,
quae tunc uasta omni incola carebat, eamque illis concessit.
Deinde creuerunt illic et multiplicati sunt insulamque usque in hodiernum diem tenuerunt.
Gurguint uero Barbtruc, cum dies uitae suae cum pace explesset,
sepultus fuit in Vrbe Legionum,
quam post obitum patris aedificiis et muris decorare studuerat.
========================================
For he said that he had been driven out of Spain 
and was wandering these seas seeking some place to have.
He also asked him for a small part of Britain to live in
to keep from wandering still further on his tiresome sea-journey;
for a year and a half had already passed from the time when he was banished
from his native land and had set sail over the ocean with his companions.
And so when Gurguint Barbtruc was informed of their petition,
and that they had come from Spain and were called Basques,
he sent men with them to the island of Ireland,
which was at that time deserted and lacked any inhabitant,
and granted it to them.
They thrived and multiplied there and hold it up to this day.
Now when the days of his life had been peacefully filled out,
Gurguint Barbtruc was buried in the City of Legions, which he had striven to
beautify with buildings and walls after his father's death.
========================================

Post illum autem Guithelinus diadema regni suscepit,
quod omni tempore uitae suae benigne et modeste tractauit.
Erat ei nobilis mulier Marcia nomine, omnibus artibus erudita.
Haec inter multa et inaudita quae proprio ingenio reppererat inuenit legem
quam Britones Marcianam appellauerunt.
Hanc etiam rex Aluredus inter cetera transtulit et Saxonica lingua Merchenelage uocauit.
At ut Guithelinus obiuit,
remansit gubernaculum regni praedictae reginae et filio ipsius,
qui Sisillius uocabatur.
Erat tunc Sisillius .vii. annorum nec aetas ipsius expetebat
ut regnum moderationi illius cessisset.
Qua de causa mater, quia consilio et sensu pollebat,
imperium totius insulae optinuit;
et cum ab hac luce migrasset,
Sisillius sumpto diademate gubernaculo potitus est. 
========================================
Now Guithelinus took up the crown of the kingdom after him,
and governed it benevolently and modestly for all of his life.
He had a noble wife by the name of Marcia, well-learned in all skills.
Among many new things that she had invented on her own was a law
which the Britons called the Marcian law.
King Alfredus translated this (among others) and called it the Mercian Law
in Saxon.
Now when Guithelinus died,
the government of the kingdom was left to this aforesaid queen and her son,
who was called Sisillius.
Sisillius was then 7 years old and his age required that
he concede his power to guidance.
For this reason his mother, since she was strong in counsel and sense,
obtained all authority over the island;
and when she had departed from this world,
Sisillius assumed the crown and took the helm.
========================================

Post illum Kimarus filius suus regimen optinuit,
cui successit Danius eiusdem frater.
Quo defuncto, insignitus est Moruidus, quem ex Tangustela concubina genuerat.
Hic nimia probitate famosissimus esset nisi plus nimiae crudelitati indulsisset;
nemini namque parcebat iratus quin eum interficeret si copiam telorum repperiret.
Erat namque pulcher aspectu et in dandis muneribus profusus,
nec erat alter tantae fortitudinis in regno qui congressum eius sustentare quiuisset.

Temporibus ipsius applicuit quidam rex Morianorum cum magna manu in
Northamhimbriam et patriam uastare incepit.
Cui Moruidus, collecta totius potestatis suae iuuentute,
obuiam perrexit et cum illo proeliatus est.
Plus ipse solus in proeliando proficiebat quam maxima pars exercitus cui principabatur. 
========================================
After him, his son Kimarus took control, and his brother Danius succeeded him.
And when he died, Moruidus was named, whom the concubine Tangustela had borne to him.
This man would have been famous for his excessive honesty,
had he not indulged in such great cruelty;
for when angry he spared no man, but would kill him if he got hold of a weapon. 
Indeed he was handsome in appearance and extravagant in gift-giving,
and there was not another in the kingdom strong enough to endure an encounter
with him.

In his time a certain king of the Flemings landed with a great band of
soldiers in Northumbria and began to lay waste to the country.
And Moruidus mustered of all strength of his young men
and marched against him to fight him.
He alone accomplished more in the battle than most of the army that he led.
========================================

Et ut uictoria potitus est, non euasit ullus uiuus quin ipsum interficeret.
Iubebat enim unum post alium ante se adduci
ut quemque perimendo crudelitatem suam saciaret; 
et cum fatigatus paulisper cessasset,
praecipiebat ipsos uiuos excoriari et excoriatos comburi.
Inter haec et alia saeuiciae suae gesta contigit ei infortunium quoddam
quod nequitiam suam deleuit.
Aduenerat namque ex partibus Hibernici maris inauditae feritatis belua,
quae incolas iuxta maritima sine intermissione deuorabat.
Cumque fama aures eius attigisset,
accessit ipse ad illam et solus cum ea congressus est.
At cum omnia tela sua in illa in uanum consumpsisset,
accelerauit monstrum illud et apertis faucibus ipsum uelut pisciculum deuorauit.

Generauerat ipse quinque filios, quorum primogenitus, Gorbonianus nomine,
solium regni suscepit.
Nullus ea tempestate iustior erat aut amantior aequi
nec qui populum maiori diligentia tractaret.
Mos eius continuus erat debitum honorem diis primum impendere
et rectam plebi iusticiam. 
========================================
And when the victory was won, not one man escaped alive, but was killed by him.
For he ordered one man after the other to be led before him,
so that he could satisfy his cruelty by killing them;
and after he got tired and stopped for a time,
he ordered them to be flayed alive, and after being flayed to be burnt.
In the course of these and his other barbaric deeds a certain misfortune
befell him, which brought his wickedness to an end.
For a creature of unheard of savagery had come from the region of the Irish Sea,
and was devouring the inhabitants near the coast without let-up.
After the report reached his ears,
he approached it himself and engaged it in single combat.
But when he had expended all his darts into those things in vain,
that monster raced in and devoured him in its open jaws like a minnow.

He'd fathered five sons, of whom the first-born, named Gorbonianus,
succeeded to the throne.
There was no-one at that time more fair or impartial
nor one who treated people with more diligence.
His chief long-term habit was to expend the honor owed to the gods 
and proper justice to the people.
========================================

Per cunctas regni Britanniae ciuitates templa deorum renouabat
et plura noua aedificabat.
Omnibus diebus eius tanta diuitiarum copia insula affluebat quantam nullae
collaterales prouinciae habebant.
Quippe colonos ad agri culturam inanimabat,
ipsos ab iniuriis dominorum defendens.
Bellatores quoque iuuenes auro et argento ditabat ita ut nulli opus esset
iniuriam alteri facere.
Inter haec et plurima innatae bonitatis ipsius gesta debita naturae
soluens ab hac luce migrauit et in urbe Trinouantum sepultus est.

Post illum Arthgallo frater regio diademate insignitur,
qui in omnibus suis actibus germano diuersus extitit;
nobiles namque ubique laborabat deponere et ignobiles exaltare,
diuitibus quibusque sua auferre, infinitos thesauros accumulans.
========================================
He restored the gods' temples throughout the cities of the kingdom of Britain 
and built many more new ones.
In all his days such an abundance of riches flowed through the island
as no neighboring provinces had.
He naturally inspired the inhabitants to the cultivation of their fields,
defending them from the injustices of their landlords.
Bellatores also enriched the young men with gold and silver so that
it was of no use to do injury to each other.
Among these and more deeds of his innate goodness due to his birth
he departed, released from the light of day, and was
buried in the city of Trinouantum.

After him the royal crown passed to his brother Arthgallo,
who proved to be the opposite of his brother in all his deeds.
For he worked everywhere to put down the noble and exalt the ignoble,
and to steal from every rich man, accumulating boundless treasures.
========================================

Quod heroes regni diutius ferre recusantes insurrexerunt in illum
et a solio regio deposuerunt.
Exin erexerunt Elidurum fratrem suum,
qui postea propter misericordiam quam in fratrem fecit Pius uocatus fuit.
Nam cum regnum emenso quinquennio possedisset,
forte in Calaterio nemore uenans obuiauit fratri suo, qui depositus fuerat.
Ipse uero, peragratis quibusque prouincialibus regnis,
auxilium quaesiuerat ut amissum honorem recuperare quiuisset,
nec usquam inuenerat;
et cum superuenientem paupertatem diutius ferre non potuisset,
reuersus est in Britanniam, .x. solummodo militibus sociatus.
Petens igitur illos quos dudum habuerat amicos,
praedictum nemus praeteribat cum Elidurus frater eius ipsum non speratum aspexit.
Quo itaque uiso, cucurrit Elidurus et amplexatus est illum,
infinita oscula ingeminans.
Et ut diu miseriam ipsius defleuit,
duxit illum secum in ciuitatem Aldclud et in thalamo suo occuluit. 
========================================
The illustrious men of the kingdom refused to bear this any longer,
and rose up against him and deposed him from the royal throne.
After that they raised his brother Elidurus,
who later was called Pius, due to the mercy which he showed his brother.
For after holding the kingdom for five years, he met his deposed brother
when he was by chance hunting in the Calaterian Forest.
Arthgallo had been traveling through every province and kingdom,
seeking aid that would allow him to regain his lost position,
and had not found it anywhere;
and when he was no longer able to bear the poverty that he was falling into,
he returned to Britain, accompanied by only 10 soldiers.
And so, he passed by the aforementioned forest,
making for his erstwhile friends,
when his brother Elidurus happened to spy him.
And so when Elidurus saw him, he ran up and embraced him,
giving him one kiss after another.
And after he lamented his wretchedness for a long time
he led him into the city of Dumbarton and hid him in his own bedchamber. 
========================================

Exin finxit se infirmum ibi nuntiosque suos per totum regnum direxit
qui principibus sibi subditis suggessissent ut ad se uisitandum uenirent.
Cumque cuncti in urbe qua iacebat conuenissent,
praecepit ut unusquisque thalamum suum singulatim et sine tumultu ingrederetur;
asserebat enim sermonem plurium capiti suo nociturum
si cateruatim superuenissent.
Credulus ergo quisque iussioni eius paruit unusque post alterum domum ingressus est.
Singulos itaque ingredientes praecipiebat Elidurus ministris
qui ad hoc parati fuerant capere ipsisque capita amputare
nisi se iterum Arthgalloni fratri suo summisissent.
Sic faciebat separatim de cunctis,
et omnes Arthgalloni mediante timore pacificauit.
Confirmato denique foedere,
duxit Elidurus Arthgallonem Eboracum
cepitque diadema de capite suo et fratris capiti imposuit.
Vnde sortitus est hoc nomen Pius, quia praedictam pietatem in fratrem habuerat.
Regnauit igitur Arthgallo decem annis et sese ab incepta nequitia correxit;
uice etenim uersa coepit ignobiles deponere et generosos exaltare,
quod suum erat unicuique permittere, rectamque iusticiam exercere.
Denique, superueniente languore, defunctus est et in urbe Kaerleir sepultus.
========================================
After that, he feigned an illness and sent his messengers throughout the
kingdom to his leading subjects,
to suggest to them that they ought to come and visit him. 
And when they all had assembled in the city in which he was lying ill,
he gave instructions that they should enter his bed chamber one by one and without commotion;
for he claimed that if they came in together the speech of so many men would hurt his head.
And so, believing this, each one obeyed his command and entered the house one
after the other.
And so, as each man entered Elidurus instructed his attendants,
who stood ready, to sieze him and cut off his head
unless he submitted once more to his brother Arthgallo.
Thus he did separately for all of them,
and he made peace between everyone and Arthgallo, through fear.
Finally, with amity established, Elidurus took Arthgallo to York
and removed the crown from his own head and placed it on his brother's.
From which he obtained the name 'Pius', because he had had the aforesaid loyalty
towards his brother.
And so Arthgallo ruled for ten years and straightened himself out from his
initial wickedness;
And indeed, turning about,
he began to put down the ignoble and exalt those of noble birth,
to let each man have what was his, and to exercise proper justice.
In the end, with feebleness approaching,
he passed away and was buried in the city of Leicester.
========================================

Erigitur Elidurus iterum in regem et pristinae dignitati restituitur;
sed dum Gorbonianum primogenitum fratrem in omni bonitate insequeretur,
duo residui fratres eius, Iugenius et Peredurus,
collectis undique armatis cum illo proeliari aggrediuntur.
Potiti uero uictoria,
ceperunt illum et infra turrim urbis Trinouantum incluserunt,
imponentes custodes.
Exin partiti sunt regnum in duo;
cuius pars quae ab Humbro flumine uersus occidentem uergit in sortem cecidit
Iugenii, altera uero cum tota Albania Pereduro.
Emensis deinde.vii. annis, obiuit Iugenius et totum regnum cessit Pereduro.
Insignitus itaque illud benigne postmodum et modeste gubernauit ita
ut antecessores fratres excellere diceretur nec de Eliduro mentio fieret.
Sed cum nemini mors parcere nesciat,
ipsa repentino cursu ueniens ipsum uitae surripuit.
Eripitur continuo Elidurus carceri et tercio in solium regni sublimatur;
et cum omne tempus suum in bonitate et iusticia expleuisset,
ab hac luce migrans exemplum pietatis successoribus suis deseruit.
========================================
Elidurus was crowned for a second time and restored to his former rank;
but although he took after his eldest brother Gorbonianus in every good deed,
his two remaining brothers, Iugenius and Peredurus,
collected armed men from every side and advanced to fight him.
Indeed, after they gained a victory, they seized and imprisoned him within
a tower in the city of Trinovantum, setting guards over him.
After that, they divided the kingdom in two;
the part that lay from the Humber River to the west fell to Iugenius,
while the other part with all of Scotland to Peredurus.
After 7 years passed, Iugenius died and the whole kingdom passed to Peredurus.
And thus distinguished, he afterwards governed with generousity and restraint,
so that he was said to excel the brothers that preceded him,
and no mention was made of Elidurus.
But death knows not how to spare any man,
and came in a hasty course to steal his life from him.
Elidurus was immediately rescued from his imprisonment and
raised to the throne of the kingdom for a third time;
and when he had fulfilled his time in goodness and justice,
he departed from this light, having served as an example to his successors.
========================================

Defuncto itaque Eliduro, suscepit Regin Gorboniani filius diadema regni et
auunculum in sensu et prudentia imitatus est;
postposita namque tyrannide iusticiam atque misericordiam in populum exercebat
nec unquam a tramite rectitudinis deuiauit.
Post illum regnauit Marganus Arthgallonis filius,
qui etiam exemplo parentum serenatus gentem Britonum cum tranquillitate tractauit.
Huic successit Enniaunus frater suus,
qui longe ab illo distans in tractando populum sexto anno regni sui a regia sede
depositus est;
postposita namque iusticia, tyrannidem praeelegerat,
quae illum a solio regni deposuit.
In loco eius positus fuit cognatus suus Iduallo Iugenii filius,
qui euentu Enniauni correctus ius atque rectitudinem colebat.
Huic successit Runo Pereduri filius, cui Gerontius Eliduri filius,
post illum Catellus filius suus, post Catellum Coillus, post Coillum Porrex,
post Porrecem Cherin.
Huic nati fuerunt tres filii,
Fulgenius uidelicet atque Eldadus nec non et Andragius,
qui omnes alter post alterum regnauerunt.
Exin successit Vrianus Andragii filius, cui Eliud, cui Cledaucus, cui Clotenus,
cui Gurgintius, cui Merianus, cui Bledudo, cui Cap, cui Oenus, cui Sisillius,
cui Bledgabred.
========================================
And so after the death of Elidurus, Gorbonianus' son Regin received the crown of
the kingdom and followed his uncle in sense and wisdom;
for he set tyranny aside, practiced justice and compassion for the people
and did not stray from the path of righteousness.
Arthgallo's son Marganus reigned after him,
who, enlightened by the example of his forefathers,
also governed the people of Britain in tranquility.
He was succeeded by his brother Enniaunus,
who differed greatly from him in governing the people
and was deposed from the royal seat in the sixth year of his reign;
for he had neglected justice and chosen tyranny instead,
which toppled him from the throne.
He was replaced by his kinsman Iduallo, Iugenius's son,
who was set straight by Enniaunus' fate and honored the law and uprightness.
He was succeeded by Runo, the son of Peredurus,
and him by Gerontius, the son of Elidurus,
and after him came his son Catellus, and Coillus after Catellus,
Porrex after Coillus, and Cherin after Porrex.
He had three sons, Fulgenius and Eldadus and Andragius as well,
who reigned one after the other.
Then Urianus, the son of Andragius, succeeded to the throne,
and then Eliud, and Cledaucus, Clotenus, Gurgintius, Merianus, Bledudo, Cap,
Oenus, Sisillius, and finally Bledgabred.
========================================

Hic omnes cantores quos retro aetas habuerat et in modulis et
in omnibus musicis instrumentis excedebat ita ut deus ioculatorum diceretur.
Post illum regnauit Arthmail frater suus, post Arthmail Eldol,
cui successit Redion, cui Rederchius, cui Samuil Penissel, cui Pir, cui Capoir.
Deinde successit Cligueillus Capoirri filius, uir in omnibus actibus modestus et
prudens et qui super omnia rectam iusticiam inter populos exercebat. 

Post illum successit Heli filius eius regnumque .lx. annis tractauit.
Hic tres generauit filios, Lud, Cassibellaunum, Nennium.
Quit primogenitus, uidelicet Lud, regnum post obitum patris suscepit.
Exin, gloriosus aedificator urbium existens,
renouauit muros urbis Trinouantum et innumerabilibus turribus eam circumcinxit.
Praecepit etiam ciuibus ut domos et aedificia sua in eadem construerent ita ut
non esset in longe positis regnis ciuitas quae pulcriora palacia contineret.
Fuit ipse bellicosus homo et in dandis epulis profusus,
et cum plures ciuitates possideret hanc prae omnibus amabat
et in illa maiori tempore totius anni commanebat. 
========================================
Bledgabred surpassed all singers of past ages, both in singing and
in all musical instruments, so that he could be called the minstrels' god.
His brother Arthmail reigned after him, and after him Eldol,
who was succeeded by Redion, then Rederchius, Samuil Penissel, Pir, and Capoir.
After that Capoir's son Cligueillus succeeded, a man disciplined and prudent
in all his actions and who above all exercised proper justice
among the populace.

After him his son Heli succeeded to the kingdom and governed for 60 years.
He fathered three sons, Lud, Cassibellaunum, and Nennium.
The first-born, namely Lud, was able to succeed after his father's death.
He was a renowned builder of cities and
restored the city's wall and surrounded it with countless towers.
He also instructed the citizens to construct their houses and buildings in the
same way, so that there should not be in distant kingdoms
a city that contained more beautiful palaces.
He was a warlike man and lavish in giving feasts,
and although he possessed many cities, he loved this one above them all
and stayed in it most of the year.
========================================

Vnde nominata fuit postmodum Kaerlud et deinde per corruptionem nominis Kaerlundein;
succedente quoque tempore, per commutationem linguarum dicta fuit Lundene
et postea Lundres, applicantibus alienigenis qui patriam sibi submittebant.
Defuncto tandem illo, corpus eius reconditum fuit in praedicta ciuitate
iuxta portam illam quae adhuc de nomine suo Porhlud Britannice,
Saxonice uero Ludesgata nuncupatur.
Nati fuerant ei duo filii, Androgeus et Tenuantius;
qui cum propter aetatem regnum tractare nequiuissent,
Cassibellaunus frater suus loco illorum sublimatur.
Mox, ut diademate insignitus fuit,
coepit ita largitate atque probitate uigere ut fama illius per remota regna diuulgaretur;
unde contigit ut totius regni monarchia sibi et non nepotibus cederet.
Cassibellaunus tamen, pietati indulgens,
noluit iuuenes expertes esse regni sed eis magnam partem distribuit;
urbem etenim Trinouantum cum ducatu Cantiae largitus est Androgeo,
ducatum uero Cornubiae Tenuantio.

Ipse autem diademate praelatus illis et totius insulae principibus imperabat.
========================================
From this the city was later called Kaerlud, and that name was later corrupted
to Kaerlundein; likewise in the times to come, through alteration of the
language it was called Lundene, and afterwards Lundres,
after contact with foreigners, who submitted themselves to the country.
When he eventually died, his body was laid to rest in the aforesaid city,
near that gate which from his name is still called Porhlud in British, and
Ludesgata in Saxon.
He fathered two sons, Androgeus and Tenuantius;
but since they could not manage the kingdom on account of their age,
his brother Cassibellaunus was raised up in their place.
After he was crowned,
he began to thrive with such largess and honesty that his fame spread through
distant kingdoms;
and it happened from this that the rule of the whole kingdom passed to himself,
and not his nephews.
Yet Cassibellaunus, indulgent in his kindness,
was unwilling for the youths to be without royal power
and distributed a large part to them;
and indeed he granted the city of Trinouantum and the dukedom of Cantia to
Androgeus, and the dukedom of Cornubiae to Tenuantius.

But he himself with the crown having offered to those princes
and ruled over the whole island.
