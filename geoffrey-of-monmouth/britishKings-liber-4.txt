LIBER IIII

Interea contigit, ut in Romanis repperitur hystoriis,
Iulium Caesarem subiugata Gallia ad litus Rutenorum uenisse;
et cum illinc Britanniam insulam aspexisset,
quaesiuit a circumstantibus quae patria
et quae gens inhabitasset dum ad occeanum intueretur.
Cumque nomen regni didicisset et populi, dixit:

'Hercle ex eadem prosapia nos Romani et Britones orti sumus,
 quia ex Troiana gente processimus.
 Nobis Aeneas post destructionem Troiae primus pater fuit, illis autem Brutus,
 quem Siluius Ascanii filii Aeneae filius progenuit.
 Sed nisi fallor ualde degenerati sunt a nobis nec quid sit milicia nouerunt,
 cum infra occeanum extra orbem commaneant.
 Leuiter cogendi erunt tributum nobis dare
 et continuum obsequium Romanae dignitati praestare.
 Prius tamen mandandum est eis
 ut inaccessi a Romano populo et intacti uectigal reddant,
 ut ceterae etiam gentes subiectionem senatui faciant,
 ne nos ipsorum cognatorum nostrorum sanguinem fundentes antiquam nobilitatem
 patris nostri Priami offendamus'.
========================================
In the meantime it happened, as we learn in the Roman histories,
that after Julius Caesar subjugated Gaul he came to the shore of the Ruteni;
and after he beheld the island of Britain from there, while gazing at the ocean,
he asked those around him what land it was and what people dwelt there.
And after learning the name of the kingdom and of the people, he said:

'By Hercules! We Romans and Britons sprang from the same lineage,
 because we proceeded from the Trojan nation.
 Our first father after the destruction of Troy was Aeneas,
 while theirs was Brutus,
 whom Silvius, the son of Ascanius, the son of Aeneas, fathered.
 But unless I am greatly mistaken, they have sunk below us
 and no longer understand military matters,
 since they live in the ocean beyond the known world.
 It would be easy to make them gather tribute and give it to us
 and to offer continuous obedience to Roman authority.
 But first, as they haven't been approached or touched by the Roman people,
 we should order them to render tax and subjugate themselves to the senate,
 as other nations also do,
 lest we spill the blood of our relatives and offend the ancient nobility
 of our forefather Priam.'

55 Quod cum litteris suis Cassibellauno regi mandauisset, indignatus est Cassibellaunus et ei epistulam suam in haec uerba direxit:
