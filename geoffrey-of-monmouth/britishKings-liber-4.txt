LIBER IIII

Interea contigit, ut in Romanis repperitur hystoriis,
Iulium Caesarem subiugata Gallia ad litus Rutenorum uenisse;
et cum illinc Britanniam insulam aspexisset,
quaesiuit a circumstantibus quae patria
et quae gens inhabitasset dum ad occeanum intueretur.
Cumque nomen regni didicisset et populi, dixit:

'Hercle ex eadem prosapia nos Romani et Britones orti sumus,
 quia ex Troiana gente processimus.
 Nobis Aeneas post destructionem Troiae primus pater fuit, illis autem Brutus,
 quem Siluius Ascanii filii Aeneae filius progenuit.
 Sed nisi fallor ualde degenerati sunt a nobis nec quid sit milicia nouerunt,
 cum infra occeanum extra orbem commaneant.
 Leuiter cogendi erunt tributum nobis dare
 et continuum obsequium Romanae dignitati praestare.
 Prius tamen mandandum est eis
 ut inaccessi a Romano populo et intacti uectigal reddant,
 ut ceterae etiam gentes subiectionem senatui faciant,
 ne nos ipsorum cognatorum nostrorum sanguinem fundentes antiquam nobilitatem
 patris nostri Priami offendamus'.
========================================
In the meantime it happened, as we learn in the Roman histories,
that after Julius Caesar subjugated Gaul he came to the shore of the Ruteni;
and after he beheld the island of Britain from there, while gazing at the ocean,
he asked those around him what land it was and what people dwelt there.
And after learning the name of the kingdom and of the people, he said:

'By Hercules! We Romans and Britons sprang from the same lineage,
 because we proceeded from the Trojan nation.
 Our first father after the destruction of Troy was Aeneas,
 while theirs was Brutus,
 whom Silvius, the son of Ascanius, the son of Aeneas, fathered.
 But unless I am greatly mistaken, they have sunk below us
 and no longer understand military matters,
 since they live in the ocean beyond the known world.
 It would be easy to make them gather tribute and give it to us
 and to offer continuous obedience to Roman authority.
 But first, as they haven't been approached or touched by the Roman people,
 we should order them to render tax and subjugate themselves to the senate,
 as other nations also do,
 lest we spill the blood of our relatives and offend the ancient nobility
 of our forefather Priam.'
========================================

Quod cum litteris suis Cassibellauno regi mandauisset,
indignatus est Cassibellaunus et ei epistulam suam in haec uerba direxit:

 'Cassibellaunus rex Britonum Gaio Iulio Caesari.
  Miranda est, Caesar, Romani populi cupiditas,
  qui quicquid est auri uel argenti sitiens
  nequit nos infra pericula occeani extra orbem positos pati
  quin census nostros appetere praesumat,
  quos hactenus quiete possedimus.
  Nec hoc quidem sufficit nisi postposita libertate subiectionem ei faciamus,
  perpetuam seruitutem subituri.
  Opprobrium itaque tibi petiuisti, Caesar,
  cum communis nobilitatis uena Britonibus et Romanis ab Aenea defluat
  et eiusdem cognationis una et eadem catena praefulgeat,
  qua in firmam amicitiam coniungi deberent.
  Illa a nobis petenda esset, non seruitus,
  quia eam potius largiri didicimus quam seruitutis iugum deferre.
========================================
And after he sent this in a letter to King Cassibellaunus,
Cassibellaunus grew angry and sent him his own letter with these words:

 'Cassibellaunus, the king of the Britons to Gaius Julius Caesar.
  Caesar, it's a wonder to see the greed of the Roman people,
  who, thirsting for anything of gold or silver,
  cannot suffer us, positioned within the perils of the ocean beyond the world,
  but that they dare to seek our wealth, which we have thus far held in peace.
  And indeed, this in not enough, but, with our liberty thrown away,
  we are to subjugate ourselves to him, to endure perpetual servitude.
  And so I fling reproach upon you, Caesar,
  since the veins of Britons and Romans flow down from Aeneas in joint nobility
  and shine forth together the same bond and with their shared kinship,
  through which they ought to be joined in a firm friendship.
  It is this friendship, not servitude, that should be striven for,
  since we have learned better to grant it than to bear the yoke of servitude.
========================================

  Libertatem namque in tantum consueuimus habere quod prorsus ignoramus
  quid sit seruituti oboedire; quam si ipsi dii conarentur nobis eripere,
  elaboraremus utique omni nisu resistere ut eam retineremus.
  Liqueat igitur dispositioni tuae, Caesar,
  nos pro illa et pro regno nostro pugnaturos
  si ut comminatus es infra insulam Britanniae superuenire inceperis'.

His itaque uisis, Gaius Iulius Caesar nauigium suum parat
prosperosque uentos expectat ut quod Cassibellauno mandauerat
effectibus prosequeretur.
========================================
  For we are so used to freedom that we have no idea what it would be like
  to submit to servitude; if the gods themselves were to try to take it from us
  by force, we would by all means take pains, with each man pressing hard,
  to resist and hold fast to it.
  Therefore, let it be established to your satisfaction, Caesar,
  if you undertake to come to the island of Britain to threaten us,
  we will fight for liberty and for our kingdom'.

And so, after he read this, Gaius Julius Caesar readied his ship
and waited for favorable winds to pursue in execution
what he had sent to Cassibellaunus in a letter.
========================================

Optato igitur uento instante,
erexit uela sua et in hostium Tamensis fluminis cum exercitu suo applicuit.
Iamque rates tellurem appulerant,
ecce Cassibellaunus cum tota fortitudine sua occurrit
et ad Dorobellum oppidum ueniens ibi consilium cum proceribus regni iniuit
qualiter hostes longius arceret.
Aderat secum Bellinus, princeps miliciae suae,
cuius consilio totum regnum tractabatur;
aderant etiam duo nepotes sui,
Androgeus uidelicet dux Trinouantum et Tenuantius dux Cornubiae,
tres quoque reges subditi sibi,
Cridious Albaniae et Gueithaet Venedociae atque Britahel Demetiae.
Qui ut ceteros in affectum pugnandi induxissent,
consilium dederunt ut recenter castra Caesaris adirent
et antequam ciuitatem aliquam siue oppidum cepisset ipsum expellere insisterent;
nam si sese infra munitiones patriae immisisset,
dicebant eum difficilius expellendum, cum sciret ubi se et commilitones suos
reciperet.
Assensum igitur praebentes cuncti petierunt littora quibus Iulius castra et
 tentoria sua erexerat.
Ibi, dispositis in utraque parte cateruis,
dextras cum hostibus commiscuerunt, pila pilis et ictus ictibus obicientes.
Nec mora, hinc et inde corruunt uulnerati, telis infra uitalia receptis.
========================================
And so, when the hoped-for wind appeared,
he raised sail and landed at the mouth of the River Thames with his army.
They had hardly driven the ships ashore
when Cassibellaunus ran to meet him with all his strength and,
coming to the town of Dorobellum, there formed a plan with the nobles of the
kingdom on how to drive the enemy away.
There was present there Bellinus, the head of his army,
by whose advice the whole kingdom was managed,
and also his two grandsons,
Androgeus the duke of Trinovantum and Tenuantius the duke of Cornwall,
and three sub-kings as well,
Cridious of Scotland and Gueithaet of Venedocia and Britahel of Demetia.
And they, to rouse the rest into a fighting spirit,
gave the advice to attack Caesar's freshly pitched camp
and strive to drive him out before he could capture any city or town;
for they said that expelling him would be more difficult
if he got into the country's fortifications,
since he'd know where he could withdraw himself and his fellow soldiers.
And so they all rendered their assent, and made for the shores on which Julius
had raised his camp and tents.
There, with troops disposed on both sides,
they fought hand to had with the enemy,
meeting spears with spears and blows with blows.
At once, wounded men fell hither and yon, taking spears in their vitals.
========================================

Manat tellus cruore morientium
ac si repentinus auster absortum mare reuomuisset.
Concurrentibus ergo aduersis cateruis,
obtulit casus Nennium et Androgeum cum Cantuaritis et ciuibus urbis Trinouantum,
quibus praesidebant, agmini quo imperator aderat.
Vt ergo conuenerunt, paene dissipata fuit imperatoria cohors,
Britonibus densa acie inuadentibus.
Et cum mixtim ictus ingeminarent,
dedit casus aditum Nennio congressum cum Iulio faciendi.
Irruens ergo in illum Nennius ultra modum laetatur se posse uel solum ictum tanto uiro ingerere. 
Quem Caesar ut impetum in se facientem aspexit,
praetenso clipeo excepit et quantum uires permiserunt cum nudato ense ipsum
super cassidem percussit.
Erecto iterum gladio, uoluit exequi primum ictum ut letiferum uulnus imprimeret.
Quod cum Nennius calluisset, interposuit clipeum suum,
in quo mucro Iulii a casside maximis labens uiribus inhaesit ita ut,
cum irruentibus turmis diutius congredi nequirent,
ipsum imperator extrahere non potuisset.
========================================
The ground flowed with the blood of the dying, as if a sudden south wind
had swallowed the sea and vomited it back up again.
And so with the opposing troops running to meet each other,
fortune brought Nennius and Androgeus, with the citizens of Canterbury and
Trinouantum, whom they commanded, up against the column where the emperor was.
And so as they came together, with the Britons attacking with a solid front,
the emperor's cohort was nearly routed.
And when they redoubled their blows in the melee,
fortune gave Nennius a chance for engaging in battle with Julius.
And so Nennius charged at him, rejoicing beyond measure
that he was able to thrust even a single blow on so great a man.
And when Caesar saw the man attacking him, he warded him off
with his shield and struck his helmet with his naked sword
as hard as his strength allowed.
He raised his sword again, wanting to follow the first blow with  a fatal wound.
But when Nennius understood this, he interposed his own shield,
and Julius' sword point glanced off his helmet and was stuck fast in his shield,
so that for a long time they were unable to do battle with troops rushing
around them, as the emperor was unable to pull it out.

Nennius ergo, gladium Caesaris praedicto modo adeptus,
abiecit suum quem tenuerat et abstracto altero in hostes irruere festinat.
Quemcumque cum ipso percutiebat, uel ei caput amputabat uel ipsum sauciatum
praeteribat ita ut nulla spes uiuendi in eo maneret.
Illi tandem in hunc modum saeuienti obuiauit Labienus tribunus,
sed in primo congressu ab eo peremptus est.
Denique, plurima parte diei emensa, irruentibus Britonibus strictis turmis
et audaces impetus facientibus uictoria fauente Deo prouenit,
et Caesar sese infra castra et naues laceratis Romanis recepit.
Deinde nocte illa resociatis ceteris naues suas intrauit
et Neptunum pro castris habere laetatur.
Cumque sibi dissuasissent socii proelia diutius ingerere,
acquiescens monitionibus eorum reversus est in Galliam.
========================================
And so Nennius, having obtained Caesar's sword in the aforesaid manner,
tossed his own aside, dislodged the other, and rushed to attack the enemy.
And whomever he struck, he either cut his head off
or left him with such a wound that he had no hope of surviving it.
After some time with him raging this way, the tribune Labienus encountered him,
but was killed by him in their first clash.
Finally, after most of the day had passed, with the Britons making 
courageous assaults with massed troops, victory was won by the grace of God,
and, with the Romans mangled, Caesar retreated to his camp and ships.
In the end, when he embarked that night and was reunited with his other ships,
he was overjoyed to have the sea in front of his camp.
And after his companions had dissuaded him from further conflict, 
he acquiesced with their advice and returned to Gaul.
========================================

Cassibellaunus ergo, ob receptum triumphum laetus,
grates Deo soluens socios uictoriae suae conuocauit
et quemque iuxta meritum probitatis maximis muneribus donauit.
Angebatur tamen ex alia parte dolore, quia frater suus Nennius,
letaliter uulneratus, in dubio uitae iacebat;
uulnerauerat enim illum Iulius in supradicto congressu et plagam inmedicabilem intulerat.
Vnde infra quindecim dies post proelium irrepente morte ab hac luce migrauit
et in urbe Trinouantum iuxta aquilonarem portam sepultus est.
Exequias autem regias facientes,
posuerunt cum illo gladium Caesaris in sarcofago,
quem infra clipeum suum pugnans retinuerat.
Erat nomen gladii Crocea Mors,
quia nullus euadebat uiuus qui cum illo uulnerabatur. 
========================================
And so Cassibellaunus, happy on account of the triumph that he'd received,
rendered thanks to God and called the comrades of his victory togther,
granting each one great gifts, according to his worth.
But he was choked with grief on another side,
because his brother Nennius, mortally wounded, lay in danger of death;
for Julius had wounded him in the above clash, inflicting an incurable injury.
And because of this, death crept in fifteen days after the battle and
he departed from this world.
He was buried in the city of Trinovantum near the northern gate.
Now while performing the royal obsequies,
they buried Caesar's sword with him in his coffin,
the one that he'd obtained fighting with his shield.
Its name was Golden Death, because no-one who was wounded by it escaped alive.
========================================

Terga igitur uertente Iulio et in Gallicano litore appulso,
rebellionem moliuntur Galli, dominium Iulii abicientes;
arbitrabantur namque ipsum ita debilitatum ut nullatenus eis amplius timori esset.
Fama etiam apud omnes una et eadem erat totum mare iam nauibus Cassibellauni
feruere, fugam ipsius insecuturi.
Vnde audaciores insistentes cogitabant quomodo Caesarem a finibus suis expellerent.
Quod Iulius callens noluit anceps bellum cum feroci populo committere
sed apertis thesauris quosque nobiliores adire
ut singulos munificatos in concordiam reduceret.
Plebi libertatem pollicetur, exheredatis amissas possessiones,
seruis etiam libertatem.
Qui prius leonina feritate fulminans ipsis omnia abstulerat
nunc mitis agnus humili uoce balans omnia posse reddere laetatur;
nec ab his blandiciis quieuit donec pacificatis cunctis amissam potestatem recuperauit.
Nullus interim dies praeteribat quin fugam suam Britonumque uictoriam recoleret. 
========================================
And so, after Julius turned back and landed on the shore of Gaul,
the Gauls revolted, casting aside Julius' dominion;
for they observed him so much weakened that they had no more fear of him at all.
Then too, the rumor that hit everyone all together and at once was
that the whole sea now boiled with Cassibellaunus' ships, pursuing his flight.
Pressing on more boldly from this, they thought of how to drive Caesar
from their country.
And when Julius knew of this, he didn't want to engage in a two-front war with
a fierce nation, but instead opened his treasure chests and approached
each of the nobles, to bring each one back into amity.
To the commoners he promised freedom,
to the disinherited the possessions that they'd lost,
and even freedom to the slaves.
He, who previously had carried everything off for himself,
striking like lightning with the savagery of a lion,
now bleated in a humble voice, like a meek lamb,
glad that he could return it all;
and he did not rest from these blandishments until he'd pacified everyone
and regained his lost power.
Meanwhile, not one day passed that he didn't mull over his flight and the
Britons' victory.
========================================

Emenso itaque biennio,
parat iterum occeanum transfretare et sese in Cassibellaunum uindicare.
Quod cum Cassibellaunus comperisset, urbes ubique muniuit,
diruta moenia renouauit, armatos milites in singulis portibus statuit.
Praeterea alueo Tamensis fluminis,
quo ad urbem Trinouantum Caesar nauigaturus erat,
palis ferreis atque plumbatis et ad modum humani femoris grossis subtus amnem
infixit ut naues Iulii superuenturae illiderentur.
Collecta etiam tota iuuentute insulae,
mansionem iuxta maritima fecit aduentum hostium expectans. 

Iulius autem, cum omnia quae sibi necessaria essent parauisset,
cum innumerabili multitudine militum mare ingressus est,
optatam stragem populo qui eum deuicerat inferre affectans.

Quam procul dubio ingessisset si illaesa classe tellure potiri quiuisset,
quod ad effectum ducere nequiuit.
========================================
And so after two years had passed, he again prepared to cross the ocean and to
avenge himself on Cassibellaunus.
But after Cassibellaunus learned of this, he fortified his cities everywhere,
restoring their walls, and set armed soldiers in every port.
In addition, in the channel of the River Thames, which Caesar had to sail up
to get to the city of Trinouantum, he drove in iron and lead stakes,
as thick as a human thigh, under the water,
so that when Julius' ships arrived they would be dashed against them.
Also, he assembled all the young men of the island and
staged them near the sea, waiting for the arrival of the enemy.

Now when Julius had prepared everything that he needed, 
he put out to sea with an innumerable multitude of soldiers,
aiming to carry out a hoped-for slaughter on the people who had defeated him.
And he would have undoubtedly carried it off if he'd been able to reach
land with an undamaged fleet, but he was not able to bring this about.
========================================

Nam dum per Tamensem praedictam ciuitatem peteret, naues eius,
praefatis palis infixae, subitum passae sunt periculum;
unde ad milia submergebantur milites dum ipsas foratas ingrediens fluuius absorberet.
Cumque id Caesari compertum esset,
uelis maxima ui retortis ad terram reuertere festinauit.
Ipsi quoque qui in tanto periculo superfuerant uix elapsi cum illo tellurem scandunt.
Hoc igitur Cassibellaunus ex ripa qua aderat aspiciens gaudet 
propter periculum submersorum sed tristatur ob salutem ceterorum.
Dato uero commilitonibus suis signo, impetum in Romanos facit.
At Romani, quamquam periculum in fluuio perpessi fuissent,
ut terra potiti sunt uiriliter Britonum irruptioni restiterunt.
Audatiam quoque pro muro habentes, stragem non minimam fecerunt,
sed tamen maiorem paciuntur quam inferebant. 
========================================
For when he made for the aforesaid city via the Thames, his ships,
pierced by the aforesaid stakes, suffered a sudden peril;
and from this thousands of soldiers were drowned as the river,
entering the holed ships, engulfed them.
And when Caesar saw this, he shifted sails with the great force
and hastened to return to land.
The men who had survived such peril by the skin of their teeth
clambered to land with him.
Now Cassibellaunus saw this from the shore and rejoiced for the drowned men,
but was downcast about the safety of the others.
He gave the signal to his fellow soldiers and launched a charge on the Romans.
But although the Romans had nearly lost their lives in the river,
they manfully resisted the Britons' assault once they gained the shore.
And they audaciously made a non-trifling slaughter before the city wall,
yet bore worse than they inflicted.
========================================

Periclitati namque in fluuio, pauciores incedebant, Britones uero,
omni hora affluentia suorum augmentati, tricies maiorem numerum habebant.
Vnde debilitatis ceteris potiti sunt triumpho.
Caesar igitur, cum sese deuictum inspexisset,
cum paucis ad naues diffugit et tutamen maris ex uoto nactus est.
Tempestiuis etiam uentis instantibus,
erexit uela sua et Morianorum litus petiuit.
Ingressus est deinde quandam turrim quam in loco qui Odnea uocatur construxerat
antequam Britanniam hac uice adiuisset.
Timebat namque Gallorum fidem et instabilitatem,
ne in sese secundo irruerent sicut supradictum est
ipsos fecisse quando primo Britonibus terga testatus est ostendisse.
Ob hanc ergo causam turrim in refugium sibi aedificauerat ut
rebelli populo resistere ualuisset si in illum ut praedictum est insurrexisset.
========================================
Because of their peril in the river, they advanced in smaller numbers,
while the Britons increased their own forces by the hour and had thirty times
the men that they did.
For this reason they won a victory over their weakened adversaries.
And so Caesar, when he saw that he'd been defeated, fled to his ships
with a few men and gained the protection of the sea, in answer to his prayer.
Having favorable winds, he raised sail and made for the shores of Flanders.
There, in a place called Odnea, he entered a tower
that he'd built before attacking Britain this time.
For he was uneasy about the Gauls' loyalty and inconstancy,
fearing that they'd turn against him again, as they did, as has been said above,
the first time he'd been shown to be driven back by the Britons. 
For this reason he had therefore erected the tower as a refuge for himself
so that if, as has already been said, they rose up against him
he'd be able to withstand a rebellious populace.
========================================

Cassibellaunus autem, secundo triumphum adeptus,
maximo gaudio fluctuans edictum fecit
ut omnes proceres Britanniae in urbe Trinouantum cum uxoribus suis conuenirent
debitasque sollempnitates patriis deis celebrarent,
qui uictoriam sibi de tanto imperatore concesserant.
Cumque omnes postposita mora aduenissent,
diuersa sacrificia facientes occisioni pecudum indulserunt.
Litauerunt ibi .xl. milia uaccarum et centum milia ouium
diuersorumque generum uolatilia quae leuiter sub numero non cadebant,
praeterea .xxx. milia siluestrium ferarum cuiusque generis collectarum.
Mox, cum diis suos honores perfecissent,
refecerunt se residuis epulis ut in sacrificiis fieri solebat.
Exin quod noctis et diei restabat diuersos ludos componentes praeterierunt. 
========================================
But Cassibellaunus, swelling with the greatest joy
after gaining a second victory, made a proclamation
that all the nobles of Britain should assemble
in the city of Trinouantum with their wives
and perform fitting solemnities for their ancestral gods,
who had given them a victory over so great a general.
And when everyone had arrived without delay,
they indulged in the killing of animals, making diverse sacrifices.
They made offerings there of forty thousand cows and a hundred thousand sheep
and various species of birds that were hard to count,
as well as thirty thousand collected beasts from forest species.
Then, after they'd finished giving honors to their gods,
they revived themselves with the leftover meats, as was usual in sacrifices.
After that they passed what remained of the night and the next day in various games.
========================================

Ludentibus ergo ipsis, contigit inclitos iuuenes,
quorum unus nepos erat regis, alter uero Androgei ducis,
pariter in palaestra contendere et ob dubiam uictoriam litigare.
Erat nomen nepotis regis Hirelglas, alterius uero Cuelinus.
Qui ut mutua conuicia adinuicem intulissent,
arripuit Cuelinus gladium nepotique regis caput amputauit.
Quo interfecto, perturbata est curia, et rumor ad Cassibellaunum uolauit.
Commotus igitur super casu amici sui Cassibellaunus Androgeo praecepit
ut Cuelinum in curia coram praesentia sua adduceret,
adductus quoque praesto esset sententiam quam proceres dictarent subire,
ne Hirelglas inultus permaneret si iniuste interfectus fuisset.
Cumque animum regis dubitasset Androgeus,
respondit sese suam curiam habere et in illa diffiniri debere
quicquid aliquis in homines suos clamaret;
si igitur rectitudinem de Cuelino decreuisset appetere,
ipsam in urbe Trinouantum ex ueterum traditione recepisset.
========================================
And so while they were playing, it happened that two illustrious youths,
of whom one was the grandson of the king, and the other of Duke Androgeus,
competed together in wrestling and quarreled on account of a contested victory.
The name of the king's grandson was Hirelglas, and the other one Cuelinus.
And while they were trading insults,
Cuelinus grabbed his sword and cut off the king's grandson's head.
And when he was killed the court was thrown into confusion
and the news flew to Cassibellaunus.
And so in a state over the fate of his loved one, Cassibellaunus ordered
Androgeus to bring Cuelinus before his presence at court,
and be induced to bear the sentence that the nobles should pronounce,
so that Hirelglas not remain unavenged if he had been unjustly killed.
But since Androgeus had doubts about the king's character,
he answered that he held his own court and that any charges
brought against his own men should be tried there;
therefore, if he was determined to seek judgement on Cuelinus,
by ancient tradition he should undertake it in the city of Trinouantum.
========================================

Cassibellaunus itaque, cum affectui suo satisfactionem nequiuisset ingerere,
comminatus est Androgeo, testans se ferro et flamma prouinciam suam populaturum
nisi peticioni suae acquiesceret.
Indignatus ergo Androgeus distulit peticioni eius parere.
Indignatus autem Cassibellaunus accelerauit prouincias ipsius uastare.
At Androgeus cotidie per cognatos et notos regem adibat petebatque
ut irae coeptae desisteret.
Et cum furorem eius nullatenus mitigare quiuisset,
diuersas meditationes iniuit qualiter ipsi resistere ualuisset.
Denique, ab omni alia spe decidens,
auxilium Caesaris petere decreuit litterasque suas ei in hanc direxit sententiam:
========================================
And so, since Cassibellaunus could not impose a penalty to his satisfaction,
he threatened Androgeus, swearing that he'd lay waste to his province
with sword and flame unless he submitted to his suit.
This enraged Androgeus and he disdained to obey his demands.
But this enraged Cassibellaunus and he raced to lay waste to Androgeus' provinces.
But Androgeus approached the king daily through kinsmen and friends
and asked him to desist from his wrath.
And since he was in no way able to soften his fury,
he pondered various ways in which he might be able to withstand him.
In the end, failing in every other hope,
he decided to ask for Caesar's help and sent him this letter to that purpose.
========================================

 'Gaio Iulio Caesari Androgeus dux Trinouantum post optatam mortem optandam salutem.
 Paenitet me aduersum te egisse dum proelia cum rege meo committeres.
 Si enim me a talibus ausis abstinuissem, deuicisses Cassibellaunum,
 cui post triumphum suum tanta irrepsit superbia ut me, per quem triumphauit,
 a finibus meis exterminare insistat.
 Haeccine ergo merita rependenda essent?
 Ego illum hereditaui, ipse me exheredare conatur.
 Ego eum in regno secundo restitui, ipse me destituere affectat.
 Me etenim contra te pugnante omnia ista largitus sum.
 Numina caelorum testor me non promeruisse iram ipsius,
 nisi promereri dicar quia diffugio nepotem meum tradere,
 quem iniusta nece dampnare adoptat.
 Quod ut manifestius discretioni tuae liqueat, causam rei aduerte.
 Contigerat nos ob laeticiam triumphi nostri sollempnitates patriis deis celebrasse;
 in quibus, cum quae agenda essent peregissemus sacrificia,
 iuuentus nostra ludos mutuos componebat.
========================================
 Androgeus the duke of Trinouantum to Gaius Julius Caesar:
 after desiring your death, I'll now desire your health.
 It pains me that I opposed you when you did battle with my king.
 For had I abstained from such exploits, you'd have overcome Cassibellaunus,
 who, after his victory, was infected with such great arrogance
 that he set about to banish me, through whom he triumphed, from my lands.
 Should not these services be compensated?
 I gave him an inheritance, and he attempted to disinherit me.
 I restored him to a second reign, he tried to leave me in the lurch.
 And indeed, it was me fighting against you that granted him all those things.
 I call on the gods of heaven to bear witness that I did not deserve his rage,
 except I am said to deserve it since I refuse to hand over my grandson,
 whom he chooses to sentence to an unjust death.
 And so that it might be proven more plainly for your discernment,
 direct your attention to the cause of the business.
 It had happened that we celebrated the rites to our fathers' gods
 on account of the joy of our victory; and after they had completed the
 necessary sacrifices, our youths set up contests among themselves.
========================================

Inter ceteros inierunt duo nepotes nostri palaestram, exemplo aliorum conducti.
Cumque meus triumphasset,
succensus est alter iniusta ira festinauitque eum percutere.
At ille, uitato ictu, cepit eum per pugnum quo gladium tenebat,
uolens eum eripere.
Interea cecidit nepos regis super mucronem confossusque morti subiacuit.
Id itaque cum regi nuntiatum esset,
praecepit michi liberare puerum meum ut pro homicidio supplicio plecteretur.
Cui cum contradixissem, uenit cum omni multitudine sua in prouincias meas,
grauissimam inferens inquietudinem.
Vnde misericordiam tuam implorans auxilium a te peto
ut ego per te dignitati meae restituar et tu per me Britannia potiaris.
De hoc autem nichil in me haesitaueris, quia omnis abest proditio.
Ea enim conditione mouentur mortales ut post inimicicias amici fiant
et post fugam ad triumphum accedant'.
========================================
 Among the rest our two grandsons started a wrestling match,
 drawn in by the example of the others.
 And after mine won, the other one, fired with an unjust rage,
 rushed up to strike him.
 But he avoided the blow and grabbed at the sword that he was holding,
 wanting to snatch it away.
 Meanwhile, the king's grandson, falling on the sword point,
 was run through and died.
 And so it when it was reported to the king,
 he ordered me to deliver my boy to be punished for murder.
 And after I refused, he came into my provinces with all his host,
 inflicting serious damage.
 From this cause imploring your mercy, I beg aid from you
 so that through you I be restored to my honor
 and through me you become master of Britain.
 You need have no hesitation about this on my account,
 because there is no betrayal in it.
 For mortal men are moved by their nature to make friends out of enemies 
 and victory out of defeat.'
========================================

His igitur inspectis, consilium habuit Iulius a familiaribus suis
ne uerbis solummodo ducis inuitatus Britanniam adiret
nisi tales dirigerentur obsides quibus securius applicare quiuisset.
Nec mora, misit ei Androgeus Scaeuam filium suum et .xxx. nobiles iuuenes ex
cognatione sua propinquos.
Datis igitur obsidibus, securus factus est Caesar
reuocatisque cateruis cum instante uento in Rutupi Portu applicuit.
Interea obsidere incipiebat Cassibellaunus urbem Trinouantum
et uillas prouinciales uastabat;
sed cum aduentum Iulii comperisset,
deseruit obsidionem et imperatori obuiare festinauit.
Vt igitur uallem prope Doroberniam intrauit,
aspexit in eadem Romanorum exercitum castra et tentoria ponentem;
adduxerat enim eos Androgeus ibidem ut illic occultum impetum urbi ingererent.
Nec mora, aduertentes Romani Britones superuenire armauerunt sese ocius
militesque suos per cateruas statuerunt.
========================================
And so, after reading this letter, Julius got advice from his inner circle
that he should not go to Britain solely at the duke's invitation,
but that they should arrange hostages that would make it safe for him to land.
Androgeus quickly sent him his son Scaeua and
30 noble youths from among his close relatives.
And so, after the hostages had been given, Caesar felt safe.
He recalled his company and landed at the port of Rutupiae with a following wind.
Meanwhile, Cassibellaunus started a siege of the city of Trinouantum
and was laying waste to its provincial estates;
but after he learned of Julius' arrival, 
he abandoned the siege and raced to meet the general.
And so, as he entered a valley near Canterbury,
he observed the Roman army itself pitching its camp and tents;
for Androgeus had persuaded them to come to that very place to carry out a sneak
attack on the city.
On seeing the Britons arrive, the Romans swiftly
armed themselves and drew up their soldiers in companies.
========================================

Ex alia uero parte armis induuntur Britones et sese per turmas consociant.
At Androgeus cum quinque milibus armatorum in prope sito nemore delituit
ut in auxilio Caesaris occurrens furtiuam
et inprouisam irruptionem Cassibellauno consociisque suis faceret.
Vt itaque hinc et inde conuenerunt,
non distulerunt mortalia tela emittere nec letiferos ictus ingeminare.
Concurrunt aduersae cateruae et multum cruoris diffundunt.
Concidunt in utraque parte uulnerati quemadmodum folia arborum in auctumno.
Illis igitur irruentibus, egreditur Androgeus ex nemore et aciem Cassibellauni,
ex qua totum bellum pendebat, a tergo inuadit.
Mox illa, in una parte irruptione Romanorum paulo ante uastata,
in alia uero conciuibus suis modo oppressa, nequiuit stationem facere;
unde dissipatis sociis arrepta fuga campum deseruit.
========================================
And on the other side the Britons put on their armor and joined up in squadrons.
But Androgeus hid in a nearby forest with five thousand armed men
so that he could run to Caesar's aid by making a secret and unexpected attack on
Cassibellaunus and his companions.
And so as the armies met, they immediately set to hurling deadly javelins
and redoubling mortal blows.
The opposing troops charged and spilled much blood.
Men fell wounded on both sides, just like tree leaves in autumn.
And so when they charged, Androgeus came out of the forest and
attacked Cassibellaunus' formation, on which the whole fight hung, from behind.
Soon the formation, crushed in one place a bit before by the Romans' attack,
and overwhelmed in another by Androgeus' companions, could not hold position;
and with his allies scattered Cassibellaunus deserted the field in flight.
========================================

Astabat prope quidam mons in cacumine saxosus densum coriletum habens.
Ad illum confugit Cassibellaunus cum suis postquam in debiliorem partem ceciderat.
Summitatem quoque eius nactus,
sese uiriliter defendebat et insequentes hostes nece afficiebat.
Insecuti namque fuerant ipsum Romani et Androgei cateruae,
fugientes turmas eius lacerantes.
Montem quoque ascendentes, crebros impetus faciebant nec praeualebant.
Saxa etenim montis eiusdemque cacuminis arduitas Britonibus defensio erat
ita ut a summo occurrentes hostibus stragem darent.
Obsedit igitur Caesar montem illum tota nocte quae iam superueniebat,
omnes exitus praecludens.
Affectabat namque regem fame cogere, quem armis nequiuerat.
O ammirabile tunc genus Britonum,
qui ipsum bis in fugam propulerunt qui totum orbem sibi submiserat!
Cui totus mundus nequiuit resistere, illi etiam fugati resistunt,
parati mortem pro patria et libertate subire.
Hinc ad laudem illorum cecinit Lucanus de Caesare
'territa quaesitis ostendit terga Britannis'.
========================================
Nearby there stood a rocky hillock with a dense hazel-thicket atop it.
Cassibellaunus and his men fled to it, hacking their way into the weaker part.
He reached its summit and vigorously defended himself,
dealing death to the pursuing enemy.
For companies of both the Romans and Androgeus had pursued him,
harrassing his fleeing troops.
Climbing the hill after him, they made repeated attacks but did not prevail.
FOr the mountain's rocks and the steepness of its peak
served to protect the Britons,
letting them race down from the summit to slaughter the enemy.
And so Caesar besieged that hill for the length of the night that was already
falling, blocking all the escape routes.
For he aimed to compel the king with hunger, since using arms hadn't worked out.
O how admirable then was the race of Britons,
who twice drove to flight the man who had subdued the whole world!
He whom the whole world could not resist, they resisted,
even after being put to flight, ready to endure death for land and liberty.
This was why Lucan praised them when he said about Caesar
'after seeking the Britons, he showed his frightened back'.
========================================

Emenso iam die secundo, cum non haberet Cassibellaunus quid comederet,
timuit ne fame caperetur, carcerem Caesaris subiturus.
Mandauit itaque Androgeo ut sese cum Iulio pacificaret,
ne dignitas gentis ex qua natus fuerat capto ipso deleretur.
Mandauit etiam ei se non promeruisse ut mortem ipsius optaret,
quamuis inquietudinem sibi intulisset.
Cumque haec retulissent nuncii, ait Androgeus:
'Non est diligendus princeps qui in bello est mitis ut agnus,
in pace ferus ut leo.
Dii caeli et terrae, orat me nunc dominus meus, qui prius imperabat.
Pacificarine Caesari et subiectionem facere desiderat cuius pacem prius
desiderauerat Caesar?
Proinde aduertere debuerat illum per quem tantum imperatorem ex regno suo
pepulit posse ipsum iterum restituere.
Non eram igitur iniuste tractandus, qui tunc illud obsequium,
nunc istud inferre poteram.

========================================
When the second day had passed and Cassibellaunus had nothing left to eat,
he was afraid of succumbing to hunger and ending up a prisoner of Caesar.
And so he sent word to Androgeus for him to make peace with Julius,
lest the honor of the nation that he was born into be erased by his capture.
He also told him that he didn't deserve for him to desire his death,
however much trouble he had inflicted on him.
And after the messengers recounted this, Androgeus said:
'It's not a good look for a leader to be as mild as a lamb in war
and as savage as a lion in peace.
O gods of heaven and earth, my lord, who once commanded me, now entreats me.
Does he, whom Caesar once asked for peace,
really desire to make peace with him, and to give him his submission?
Then he ought to have realized that the man who drove so great a general
away from his kingdom would be able to bring him back again.
I ought not to have been treated so unjustly,
I who could then perform that service, and can now perform this one.

========================================

Insipientia obducitur qui commilitones quibus triumphat iniuriis uel contumeliis
infestat.
Non enim est ullius ducis uictoria sed illorum qui pro eo sanguinem suum pugnando diffundunt.
Tamen pacificabo illum si potero, quia iniuria quam michi intulit satis uindicata est in illo cum misericordiam meam imploret'.

Post haec festinauit Androgeus ad Iulium amplexusque ipsius genua eum in hunc allocutus est sermonem:

'Ecce satis uindicasti te in Cassibellaunum.
Misericordiam de illo habe.
Quid amplius agendum est quam ut subiectionem faciens uectigal Romanae dignitati reddat?".

Cumque nichil respondisset Caesar, ait iterum Androgeus:

'Hoc solum pactus sum tibi, Caesar,
ut summisso Cassibellauno Britanniam tibi subdere laborarem.
Ecce uictus est Cassibellaunus et Britannia tibi auxilio meo subdita.
Quid ultra tibi debeo?
Nolit creator omnium ut dominum meum misericordiam meam orantem
rectumque michi de illata iniuria offerentem patiar umquam
uel in uinculis uinciri.
Non leue est interficere Cassibellaunum me uiuente,
cui auxilium meum reddere non erubescam nisi consilio meo parueris'.
========================================
He is swallowed in foolishness who deals injuries or affronts on 
his fellow soldiers, through whom he has triumphed.
For victory does not belong to any leader
but to those who pour out their blood for him in battle.
Nevertheless I will make peace for him if I can,
since the harm that he inflicted on me was sufficiently
avenged when he begged for my mercy.'

After this Androgeus hastened to Julius and embraced his knees
and addressed him in this speech:

'Look, you have avenged yourself suficiently on Cassibellaunus.
 Have mercy on him.
 What more ought be done than for him to make submission and render tribute
 to the authority of Rome?'

And when Caesar gave no answer, Androgeus again said:

'This alone have I agreed on for you, Caesar,
 to work to supply Britain to you, with Cassibellaunus' submission.
 Look, Cassibellaunus is defeated and Britain is supplied to you by my aid.
 What more do I owe you?
 The creator of all does not want that I should allow my lord,
 who is begging my mercy and offering rectitude to me for the injury inflicted,
 to ever be bound in chains.
 While I live, it will not be easy to kill Cassibellaunus,
 to whom I will not blush to render my aid if you do not comply with me.'
========================================

Timore igitur Androgei mitigatus Iulius cepit a Cassibellauno concordiam
cum uectigali singulis annis reddendo;
erat autem uectigal quod spopondit tria milia librarum argenti.
Exin amici facti adinuicem Iulius et Cassibellaunus mutua donaria alter alteri dederunt.
Deinde hiemauit Caesar in Britannia et redeunte uere in Gallias transfretauit.
Succedente postmodum tempore,
collectis undique ex omni genere militibus Romam contra Pompeium perrexit.

Cumque postmodum septem anni praeterissent,
defunctus est Cassibellaunus et in Eboraco sepultus.
Cui successit Tenuantius dux Cornubiae, frater Androgei;
nam Androgeus Romam cum Caesare profectus fuerat.
Diademate igitur insignitus Tenuantius regnum in diligentia optinuit.
Erat ipse bellicosus uir et qui uigorem iusticiae colebat.
========================================
And so, cowed for fear of Androgeus, Julius made peace with Cassibellaunus,
with tribute to be rendered every year;
now the tribute that he promised was three thousand pounds of silver.
After they'd been reconciled, Julius and Cassibellaunus exchanged gifts.
Then Caesar wintered over in Britain and crossed back over to Gaul with the
return of spring.
A little later, with the season advancing,
with soldiers amassed from everywhere from all ranks of life,
he went on to Rome against Pompey.

And later, when seven years had passed,
Cassibellaunus passed away and was buried in York.
He was succeeded by Tenuantius, the duke of Cornwall, Androgeus' brother;
for Androgeus had gone to Rome with Caesar.
And so, marked with the crown, Tenuantius obtained the kingdom in diligence.
He was a warlike man and one who cherished a vigor for justice.
========================================

Post illum promotus est ad culmen regale Kimbelinus filius suus,
miles strenuus, quem Augustus Caesar nutriuerat et armis decorauerat.
Hic in tantam amiciciam Romanorum inciderat
ut cum posset tributum eorum detinere gratis impendebat.
In diebus illis natus est dominus noster Iesus Christus,
cuius precioso sanguine redemptum est humanum genus,
quod anteacto tempore daemonum catena obligabatur.

Kimbelinus igitur, cum Britanniam decem annis gubernasset,
genuit duos filios, quorum primogenito nomen erat Guider, alteri Aruiragus.
Exin, expletis uitae suae diebus, cessit gubernaculum regni Guiderio.
========================================
He was succeeded by Kimbeline, his royal son -
a vigorous soldier, whom Augustus Caesar fostered and decorated in arms.
He had fallen into such a friendship with the Romans 
that when he could've kept their tribute he freely paid it.
In his days was born our lord Jesus Christ,
whose precious blood redeemed mankind,
that in the past was bound in demons' chains.

And so Kimbeline, after governing Britain for ten years,
had two sons, with the eldest named Guider, and the other Aruiragus.
Then, when the days of his life were fulfilled,
he passed the government of the kingdom to Guider.
========================================

Cum igitur tributum quod appetebant Romanis denegaret, superuenit Claudius,
qui in imperium subrogatus fuerat.
Aderat secum princeps miliciae suae, uocabulo Laelius Hamo,
cuius consilio proelia quae gerenda erant tractabantur.
Hic itaque, ut in ciuitate Portcestria applicuit,
coepit portas eius muro praecludere exitumque ciuibus abnegare.
Cupiebat namque ipsos fame affectos uel deditioni compellere uel sine clementia interire.

Diuulgato igitur Claudii Caesaris aduentu,
collegit Guiderius omnem armatum regni militem et Romanum exercitum petiuit.
Commisso deinde proelio, acerrime coepit hostes infestare,
plus solus cum gladio suo quam maior pars exercitus sui perimens.
Iam Claudius naues petebat, iam Romani paene dissipabantur,
cum uersutus Hamo, proiectis illis quibus indutus fuerat,
arma Britannica cepit et quasi Britannus contra suos pugnabat.
========================================
And so when he denied the Romans their tribute, Claudius,
who had been elected emperor, arrived.
He'd brought with him the leader of his soldiers, Laelius Hamo by name,
who gave him advice on how battles were to be fought.
And so when this man landed at the city of Portchester, he
set about walling in its gates and denying egress to its citizens.
For he wanted them to be afflicted with hunger,
to compel them either to surrender or to perish without mercy.

And so when Claudius Caesar's arrival became known,
Guiderius gathered every man of arms in the kingdom and attacked the Roman army.
Then when the battle commenced, he began to harass the enemy most bitterly,
killing more with his sword alone than the greater part of his army.
Then, when Claudius made for his ships, and the Romans were nearly destroyed,
wily Hamo, threw away his own arms and
donned British armor and fought, as if a Briton, against his own men.
========================================

Deinde hortabatur Britones ad insequendum, festinatum triumphum promittens;
didicerat enim linguam eorum et mores,
quia inter Britannicos obsides Romae nutritus fuerat.
Exin accessit ipse paulatim iuxta regem
adituque inuento ipsum nichil tale timentem mucrone suffocauit.
Elapsus deinde inter hostium cuneos,
sese cum nefanda uictoria inter suos recepit.
At Aruiragus eiusdem frater, ut ipsum peremptum inspexit,
confestim deposuit arma sua armisque regis indutus hinc
et inde Britones ad perstandum inanimabat quasi ipse Guiderius fuisset;
qui nescientes casum regis monitu eius resistebant,
pugnabant, stragemque non minimam inferebant. 
========================================
Then he urged the Britons to pursue them, promising a swift victory;
for he had learned their tongue and customs,
as he had grown up among the British hostages in Rome.
After that he edged, with his approach unnoticed, closer and closer to the king,
how had no fear of anything of the sort, and killed him with his sword.
Then he escaped between the enemy battalions and
got back to his own lines with an abominable victory.
But as Aruiragus, the king's brother, saw the killing,
he at once laid down his own arms and donned the king's,
and, as if he were Guiderius, on every side roused the Britons to stand firm;
and they heeded his command, not knowing of the king's plight,
made a stand, fought, and carried out a slaughter that was not small.
