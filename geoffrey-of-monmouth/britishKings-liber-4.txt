LIBER IIII

Interea contigit, ut in Romanis repperitur hystoriis,
Iulium Caesarem subiugata Gallia ad litus Rutenorum uenisse;
et cum illinc Britanniam insulam aspexisset,
quaesiuit a circumstantibus quae patria
et quae gens inhabitasset dum ad occeanum intueretur.
Cumque nomen regni didicisset et populi, dixit:

'Hercle ex eadem prosapia nos Romani et Britones orti sumus,
 quia ex Troiana gente processimus.
 Nobis Aeneas post destructionem Troiae primus pater fuit, illis autem Brutus,
 quem Siluius Ascanii filii Aeneae filius progenuit.
 Sed nisi fallor ualde degenerati sunt a nobis nec quid sit milicia nouerunt,
 cum infra occeanum extra orbem commaneant.
 Leuiter cogendi erunt tributum nobis dare
 et continuum obsequium Romanae dignitati praestare.
 Prius tamen mandandum est eis
 ut inaccessi a Romano populo et intacti uectigal reddant,
 ut ceterae etiam gentes subiectionem senatui faciant,
 ne nos ipsorum cognatorum nostrorum sanguinem fundentes antiquam nobilitatem
 patris nostri Priami offendamus'.
========================================
In the meantime it happened, as we learn in the Roman histories,
that after Julius Caesar subjugated Gaul he came to the shore of the Ruteni;
and after he beheld the island of Britain from there, while gazing at the ocean,
he asked those around him what land it was and what people dwelt there.
And after learning the name of the kingdom and of the people, he said:

'By Hercules! We Romans and Britons sprang from the same lineage,
 because we proceeded from the Trojan nation.
 Our first father after the destruction of Troy was Aeneas,
 while theirs was Brutus,
 whom Silvius, the son of Ascanius, the son of Aeneas, fathered.
 But unless I am greatly mistaken, they have sunk below us
 and no longer understand military matters,
 since they live in the ocean beyond the known world.
 It would be easy to make them gather tribute and give it to us
 and to offer continuous obedience to Roman authority.
 But first, as they haven't been approached or touched by the Roman people,
 we should order them to render tax and subjugate themselves to the senate,
 as other nations also do,
 lest we spill the blood of our relatives and offend the ancient nobility
 of our forefather Priam.'
========================================

Quod cum litteris suis Cassibellauno regi mandauisset,
indignatus est Cassibellaunus et ei epistulam suam in haec uerba direxit:

 'Cassibellaunus rex Britonum Gaio Iulio Caesari.
  Miranda est, Caesar, Romani populi cupiditas,
  qui quicquid est auri uel argenti sitiens
  nequit nos infra pericula occeani extra orbem positos pati
  quin census nostros appetere praesumat,
  quos hactenus quiete possedimus.
  Nec hoc quidem sufficit nisi postposita libertate subiectionem ei faciamus,
  perpetuam seruitutem subituri.
  Opprobrium itaque tibi petiuisti, Caesar,
  cum communis nobilitatis uena Britonibus et Romanis ab Aenea defluat
  et eiusdem cognationis una et eadem catena praefulgeat,
  qua in firmam amicitiam coniungi deberent.
  Illa a nobis petenda esset, non seruitus,
  quia eam potius largiri didicimus quam seruitutis iugum deferre.
========================================
And after he sent this in a letter to King Cassibellaunus,
Cassibellaunus grew angry and sent him his own letter with these words:

 'Cassibellaunus, the king of the Britons to Gaius Julius Caesar.
  Caesar, it's a wonder to see the greed of the Roman people,
  who, thirsting for anything of gold or silver,
  cannot suffer us, positioned within the perils of the ocean beyond the world,
  but that they dare to seek our wealth, which we have thus far held in peace.
  And indeed, this in not enough, but, with our liberty thrown away,
  we are to subjugate ourselves to him, to endure perpetual servitude.
  And so I fling reproach upon you, Caesar,
  since the veins of Britons and Romans flow down from Aeneas in joint nobility
  and shine forth together the same bond and with their shared kinship,
  through which they ought to be joined in a firm friendship.
  It is this friendship, not servitude, that should be striven for,
  since we have learned better to grant it than to bear the yoke of servitude.
========================================

  Libertatem namque in tantum consueuimus habere quod prorsus ignoramus
  quid sit seruituti oboedire; quam si ipsi dii conarentur nobis eripere,
  elaboraremus utique omni nisu resistere ut eam retineremus.
  Liqueat igitur dispositioni tuae, Caesar,
  nos pro illa et pro regno nostro pugnaturos
  si ut comminatus es infra insulam Britanniae superuenire inceperis'.

His itaque uisis, Gaius Iulius Caesar nauigium suum parat
prosperosque uentos expectat ut quod Cassibellauno mandauerat
effectibus prosequeretur.
========================================
  For we are so used to freedom that we have no idea what it would be like
  to submit to servitude; if the gods themselves were to try to take it from us
  by force, we would by all means take pains, with each man pressing hard,
  to resist and hold fast to it.
  Therefore, let it be established to your satisfaction, Caesar,
  if you undertake to come to the island of Britain to threaten us,
  we will fight for liberty and for our kingdom'.

And so, after he read this, Gaius Julius Caesar readied his ship
and waited for favorable winds to pursue in execution
what he had sent to Cassibellaunus in a letter.
========================================

Optato igitur uento instante,
erexit uela sua et in hostium Tamensis fluminis cum exercitu suo applicuit.
Iamque rates tellurem appulerant,
ecce Cassibellaunus cum tota fortitudine sua occurrit
et ad Dorobellum oppidum ueniens ibi consilium cum proceribus regni iniuit
qualiter hostes longius arceret.
Aderat secum Bellinus, princeps miliciae suae,
cuius consilio totum regnum tractabatur;
aderant etiam duo nepotes sui,
Androgeus uidelicet dux Trinouantum et Tenuantius dux Cornubiae,
tres quoque reges subditi sibi,
Cridious Albaniae et Gueithaet Venedociae atque Britahel Demetiae.
Qui ut ceteros in affectum pugnandi induxissent,
consilium dederunt ut recenter castra Caesaris adirent
et antequam ciuitatem aliquam siue oppidum cepisset ipsum expellere insisterent;
nam si sese infra munitiones patriae immisisset,
dicebant eum difficilius expellendum, cum sciret ubi se et commilitones suos
reciperet.
Assensum igitur praebentes cuncti petierunt littora quibus Iulius castra et
 tentoria sua erexerat.
Ibi, dispositis in utraque parte cateruis,
dextras cum hostibus commiscuerunt, pila pilis et ictus ictibus obicientes.
Nec mora, hinc et inde corruunt uulnerati, telis infra uitalia receptis.
========================================
And so, when the hoped-for wind appeared,
he raised sail and landed at the mouth of the River Thames with his army.
They had hardly driven the ships ashore
when Cassibellaunus ran to meet him with all his strength and,
coming to the town of Dorobellum, there formed a plan with the nobles of the
kingdom on how to drive the enemy away.
There was present there Bellinus, the head of his army,
by whose advice the whole kingdom was managed,
and also his two grandsons,
Androgeus the duke of Trinovantum and Tenuantius the duke of Cornwall,
and three sub-kings as well,
Cridious of Scotland and Gueithaet of Venedocia and Britahel of Demetia.
And they, to rouse the rest into a fighting spirit,
gave the advice to attack Caesar's freshly pitched camp
and strive to drive him out before he could capture any city or town;
for they said that expelling him would be more difficult
if he got into the country's fortifications,
since he'd know where he could withdraw himself and his fellow soldiers.
And so they all rendered their assent, and made for the shores on which Julius
had raised his camp and tents.
There, with troops disposed on both sides,
they fought hand to had with the enemy,
meeting spears with spears and blows with blows.
At once, wounded men fell hither and yon, taking spears in their vitals.
========================================

Manat tellus cruore morientium
ac si repentinus auster absortum mare reuomuisset.
Concurrentibus ergo aduersis cateruis,
obtulit casus Nennium et Androgeum cum Cantuaritis et ciuibus urbis Trinouantum,
quibus praesidebant, agmini quo imperator aderat.
Vt ergo conuenerunt, paene dissipata fuit imperatoria cohors,
Britonibus densa acie inuadentibus.
Et cum mixtim ictus ingeminarent,
dedit casus aditum Nennio congressum cum Iulio faciendi.
Irruens ergo in illum Nennius ultra modum laetatur se posse uel solum ictum tanto uiro ingerere. 
Quem Caesar ut impetum in se facientem aspexit,
praetenso clipeo excepit et quantum uires permiserunt cum nudato ense ipsum
super cassidem percussit.
Erecto iterum gladio, uoluit exequi primum ictum ut letiferum uulnus imprimeret.
Quod cum Nennius calluisset, interposuit clipeum suum,
in quo mucro Iulii a casside maximis labens uiribus inhaesit ita ut,
cum irruentibus turmis diutius congredi nequirent,
ipsum imperator extrahere non potuisset.
========================================
The ground flowed with the blood of the dying, as if a sudden south wind
had swallowed the sea and vomited it back up again.
And so with the opposing troops running to meet each other,
fortune brought Nennius and Androgeus, with the citizens of Canterbury and
Trinouantum, whom they commanded, up against the column where the emperor was.
And so as they came together, with the Britons attacking with a solid front,
the emperor's cohort was nearly routed.
And when they redoubled their blows in the melee,
fortune gave Nennius a chance for engaging in battle with Julius.
And so Nennius charged at him, rejoicing beyond measure
that he was able to thrust even a single blow on so great a man.
And when Caesar saw the man attacking him, he warded him off
with his shield and struck his helmet with his naked sword
as hard as his strength allowed.
He raised his sword again, wanting to follow the first blow with  a fatal wound.
But when Nennius understood this, he interposed his own shield,
and Julius' sword point glanced off his helmet and was stuck fast in his shield,
so that for a long time they were unable to do battle with troops rushing
around them, as the emperor was unable to pull it out.




Nennius ergo, gladium Caesaris praedicto modo adeptus, abiecit suum quem tenuerat et abstracto altero in hostes irruere festinat. Quemcumque cum ipso percutiebat, uel ei caput amputabat uel ipsum sauciatum praeteribat ita ut nulla spes uiuendi in eo maneret. Illi tandem in hunc modum saeuienti obuiauit Labienus tribunus, sed in primo congressu ab eo peremptus est. Denique, plurima parte diei emensa, irruentibus Britonibus strictis turmis et audaces impetus facientibus uictoria fauente Deo prouenit, et Caesar sese infra castra et naues laceratis Romanis recepit. Deinde nocte illa resociatis ceteris naues suas intrauit et Neptunum pro castris habere laetatur. Cumque sibi dissuasissent socii proelia diutius ingerere, acquiescens monitionibus
