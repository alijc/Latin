LIBER IIII

Interea contigit, ut in Romanis repperitur hystoriis,
Iulium Caesarem subiugata Gallia ad litus Rutenorum uenisse;
et cum illinc Britanniam insulam aspexisset,
quaesiuit a circumstantibus quae patria
et quae gens inhabitasset dum ad occeanum intueretur.
Cumque nomen regni didicisset et populi, dixit:

'Hercle ex eadem prosapia nos Romani et Britones orti sumus,
 quia ex Troiana gente processimus.
 Nobis Aeneas post destructionem Troiae primus pater fuit, illis autem Brutus,
 quem Siluius Ascanii filii Aeneae filius progenuit.
 Sed nisi fallor ualde degenerati sunt a nobis nec quid sit milicia nouerunt,
 cum infra occeanum extra orbem commaneant.
 Leuiter cogendi erunt tributum nobis dare
 et continuum obsequium Romanae dignitati praestare.
 Prius tamen mandandum est eis
 ut inaccessi a Romano populo et intacti uectigal reddant,
 ut ceterae etiam gentes subiectionem senatui faciant,
 ne nos ipsorum cognatorum nostrorum sanguinem fundentes antiquam nobilitatem
 patris nostri Priami offendamus'.
========================================
In the meantime it happened, as we learn in the Roman histories,
that after Julius Caesar subjugated Gaul he came to the shore of the Ruteni;
and after he beheld the island of Britain from there, while gazing at the ocean,
he asked those around him what land it was and what people dwelt there.
And after learning the name of the kingdom and of the people, he said:

'By Hercules! We Romans and Britons sprang from the same lineage,
 because we proceeded from the Trojan nation.
 Our first father after the destruction of Troy was Aeneas,
 while theirs was Brutus,
 whom Silvius, the son of Ascanius, the son of Aeneas, fathered.
 But unless I am greatly mistaken, they have sunk below us
 and no longer understand military matters,
 since they live in the ocean beyond the known world.
 It would be easy to make them gather tribute and give it to us
 and to offer continuous obedience to Roman authority.
 But first, as they haven't been approached or touched by the Roman people,
 we should order them to render tax and subjugate themselves to the senate,
 as other nations also do,
 lest we spill the blood of our relatives and offend the ancient nobility
 of our forefather Priam.'
========================================

Quod cum litteris suis Cassibellauno regi mandauisset,
indignatus est Cassibellaunus et ei epistulam suam in haec uerba direxit:

 'Cassibellaunus rex Britonum Gaio Iulio Caesari.
  Miranda est, Caesar, Romani populi cupiditas,
  qui quicquid est auri uel argenti sitiens
  nequit nos infra pericula occeani extra orbem positos pati
  quin census nostros appetere praesumat,
  quos hactenus quiete possedimus.
  Nec hoc quidem sufficit nisi postposita libertate subiectionem ei faciamus,
  perpetuam seruitutem subituri.
  Opprobrium itaque tibi petiuisti, Caesar,
  cum communis nobilitatis uena Britonibus et Romanis ab Aenea defluat
  et eiusdem cognationis una et eadem catena praefulgeat,
  qua in firmam amicitiam coniungi deberent.
  Illa a nobis petenda esset, non seruitus,
  quia eam potius largiri didicimus quam seruitutis iugum deferre.
========================================
And after he sent this in a letter to King Cassibellaunus,
Cassibellaunus grew angry and sent him his own letter with these words:

 'Cassibellaunus, the king of the Britons to Gaius Julius Caesar.
  Caesar, it's a wonder to see the greed of the Roman people,
  who, thirsting for anything of gold or silver,
  cannot suffer us, positioned within the perils of the ocean beyond the world,
  but that they dare to seek our wealth, which we have thus far held in peace.
  And indeed, this in not enough, but, with our liberty thrown away,
  we are to subjugate ourselves to him, to endure perpetual servitude.
  And so I fling reproach upon you, Caesar,
  since the veins of Britons and Romans flow down from Aeneas in joint nobility
  and shine forth together the same bond and with their shared kinship,
  through which they ought to be joined in a firm friendship.
  It is this friendship, not servitude, that should be striven for,
  since we have learned better to grant it than to bear the yoke of servitude.
========================================

  Libertatem namque in tantum consueuimus habere quod prorsus ignoramus
  quid sit seruituti oboedire; quam si ipsi dii conarentur nobis eripere,
  elaboraremus utique omni nisu resistere ut eam retineremus.
  Liqueat igitur dispositioni tuae, Caesar,
  nos pro illa et pro regno nostro pugnaturos
  si ut comminatus es infra insulam Britanniae superuenire inceperis'.

His itaque uisis, Gaius Iulius Caesar nauigium suum parat
prosperosque uentos expectat ut quod Cassibellauno mandauerat
effectibus prosequeretur.
========================================
  For we are so used to freedom that we have no idea what it would be like
  to submit to servitude; if the gods themselves were to try to take it from us
  by force, we would by all means take pains, with each man pressing hard,
  to resist and hold fast to it.
  Therefore, let it be established to your satisfaction, Caesar,
  if you undertake to come to the island of Britain to threaten us,
  we will fight for liberty and for our kingdom'.

And so, after he read this, Gaius Julius Caesar readied his ship
and waited for favorable winds to pursue in execution
what he had sent to Cassibellaunus in a letter.
========================================

Optato igitur uento instante,
erexit uela sua et in hostium Tamensis fluminis cum exercitu suo applicuit.
Iamque rates tellurem appulerant,
ecce Cassibellaunus cum tota fortitudine sua occurrit
et ad Dorobellum oppidum ueniens ibi consilium cum proceribus regni iniuit
qualiter hostes longius arceret.
Aderat secum Bellinus, princeps miliciae suae,
cuius consilio totum regnum tractabatur;
aderant etiam duo nepotes sui,
Androgeus uidelicet dux Trinouantum et Tenuantius dux Cornubiae,
tres quoque reges subditi sibi,
Cridious Albaniae et Gueithaet Venedociae atque Britahel Demetiae.
Qui ut ceteros in affectum pugnandi induxissent,
consilium dederunt ut recenter castra Caesaris adirent
et antequam ciuitatem aliquam siue oppidum cepisset ipsum expellere insisterent;
nam si sese infra munitiones patriae immisisset,
dicebant eum difficilius expellendum, cum sciret ubi se et commilitones suos
reciperet.
Assensum igitur praebentes cuncti petierunt littora quibus Iulius castra et
 tentoria sua erexerat.
Ibi, dispositis in utraque parte cateruis,
dextras cum hostibus commiscuerunt, pila pilis et ictus ictibus obicientes.
Nec mora, hinc et inde corruunt uulnerati, telis infra uitalia receptis.
========================================
And so, when the hoped-for wind appeared,
he raised sail and landed at the mouth of the River Thames with his army.
They had hardly driven the ships ashore
when Cassibellaunus ran to meet him with all his strength and,
coming to the town of Dorobellum, there formed a plan with the nobles of the
kingdom on how to drive the enemy away.
There was present there Bellinus, the head of his army,
by whose advice the whole kingdom was managed,
and also his two grandsons,
Androgeus the duke of Trinovantum and Tenuantius the duke of Cornwall,
and three sub-kings as well,
Cridious of Scotland and Gueithaet of Venedocia and Britahel of Demetia.
And they, to rouse the rest into a fighting spirit,
gave the advice to attack Caesar's freshly pitched camp
and strive to drive him out before he could capture any city or town;
for they said that expelling him would be more difficult
if he got into the country's fortifications,
since he'd know where he could withdraw himself and his fellow soldiers.
And so they all rendered their assent, and made for the shores on which Julius
had raised his camp and tents.
There, with troops disposed on both sides,
they fought hand to had with the enemy,
meeting spears with spears and blows with blows.
At once, wounded men fell hither and yon, taking spears in their vitals.
========================================

Manat tellus cruore morientium
ac si repentinus auster absortum mare reuomuisset.
Concurrentibus ergo aduersis cateruis,
obtulit casus Nennium et Androgeum cum Cantuaritis et ciuibus urbis Trinouantum,
quibus praesidebant, agmini quo imperator aderat.
Vt ergo conuenerunt, paene dissipata fuit imperatoria cohors,
Britonibus densa acie inuadentibus.
Et cum mixtim ictus ingeminarent,
dedit casus aditum Nennio congressum cum Iulio faciendi.
Irruens ergo in illum Nennius ultra modum laetatur se posse uel solum ictum tanto uiro ingerere. 
Quem Caesar ut impetum in se facientem aspexit,
praetenso clipeo excepit et quantum uires permiserunt cum nudato ense ipsum
super cassidem percussit.
Erecto iterum gladio, uoluit exequi primum ictum ut letiferum uulnus imprimeret.
Quod cum Nennius calluisset, interposuit clipeum suum,
in quo mucro Iulii a casside maximis labens uiribus inhaesit ita ut,
cum irruentibus turmis diutius congredi nequirent,
ipsum imperator extrahere non potuisset.
========================================
The ground flowed with the blood of the dying, as if a sudden south wind
had swallowed the sea and vomited it back up again.
And so with the opposing troops running to meet each other,
fortune brought Nennius and Androgeus, with the citizens of Canterbury and
Trinouantum, whom they commanded, up against the column where the emperor was.
And so as they came together, with the Britons attacking with a solid front,
the emperor's cohort was nearly routed.
And when they redoubled their blows in the melee,
fortune gave Nennius a chance for engaging in battle with Julius.
And so Nennius charged at him, rejoicing beyond measure
that he was able to thrust even a single blow on so great a man.
And when Caesar saw the man attacking him, he warded him off
with his shield and struck his helmet with his naked sword
as hard as his strength allowed.
He raised his sword again, wanting to follow the first blow with  a fatal wound.
But when Nennius understood this, he interposed his own shield,
and Julius' sword point glanced off his helmet and was stuck fast in his shield,
so that for a long time they were unable to do battle with troops rushing
around them, as the emperor was unable to pull it out.

Nennius ergo, gladium Caesaris praedicto modo adeptus,
abiecit suum quem tenuerat et abstracto altero in hostes irruere festinat.
Quemcumque cum ipso percutiebat, uel ei caput amputabat uel ipsum sauciatum
praeteribat ita ut nulla spes uiuendi in eo maneret.
Illi tandem in hunc modum saeuienti obuiauit Labienus tribunus,
sed in primo congressu ab eo peremptus est.
Denique, plurima parte diei emensa, irruentibus Britonibus strictis turmis
et audaces impetus facientibus uictoria fauente Deo prouenit,
et Caesar sese infra castra et naues laceratis Romanis recepit.
Deinde nocte illa resociatis ceteris naues suas intrauit
et Neptunum pro castris habere laetatur.
Cumque sibi dissuasissent socii proelia diutius ingerere,
acquiescens monitionibus eorum reversus est in Galliam.
========================================
And so Nennius, having obtained Caesar's sword in the aforesaid manner,
tossed his own aside, dislodged the other, and rushed to attack the enemy.
And whomever he struck, he either cut his head off
or left him with such a wound that he had no hope of surviving it.
After some time with him raging this way, the tribune Labienus encountered him,
but was killed by him in their first clash.
Finally, after most of the day had passed, with the Britons making 
courageous assaults with massed troops, victory was won by the grace of God,
and, with the Romans mangled, Caesar retreated to his camp and ships.
In the end, when he embarked that night and was reunited with his other ships,
he was overjoyed to have the sea in front of his camp.
And after his companions had dissuaded him from further conflict, 
he acquiesced with their advice and returned to Gaul.
========================================

Cassibellaunus ergo, ob receptum triumphum laetus,
grates Deo soluens socios uictoriae suae conuocauit
et quemque iuxta meritum probitatis maximis muneribus donauit.
Angebatur tamen ex alia parte dolore, quia frater suus Nennius,
letaliter uulneratus, in dubio uitae iacebat;
uulnerauerat enim illum Iulius in supradicto congressu et plagam inmedicabilem intulerat.
Vnde infra quindecim dies post proelium irrepente morte ab hac luce migrauit
et in urbe Trinouantum iuxta aquilonarem portam sepultus est.
Exequias autem regias facientes,
posuerunt cum illo gladium Caesaris in sarcofago,
quem infra clipeum suum pugnans retinuerat.
Erat nomen gladii Crocea Mors,
quia nullus euadebat uiuus qui cum illo uulnerabatur. 
========================================
And so Cassibellaunus, happy on account of the triumph that he'd received,
rendered thanks to God and called the comrades of his victory togther,
granting each one great gifts, according to his worth.
But he was choked with grief on another side,
because his brother Nennius, mortally wounded, lay in danger of death;
for Julius had wounded him in the above clash, inflicting an incurable injury.
And because of this, death crept in fifteen days after the battle and
he departed from this world.
He was buried in the city of Trinovantum near the northern gate.
Now while performing the royal obsequies,
they buried Caesar's sword with him in his coffin,
the one that he'd obtained fighting with his shield.
Its name was Golden Death, because no-one who was wounded by it escaped alive.
========================================

Terga igitur uertente Iulio et in Gallicano litore appulso,
rebellionem moliuntur Galli, dominium Iulii abicientes;
arbitrabantur namque ipsum ita debilitatum ut nullatenus eis amplius timori esset.
Fama etiam apud omnes una et eadem erat totum mare iam nauibus Cassibellauni
feruere, fugam ipsius insecuturi.
Vnde audaciores insistentes cogitabant quomodo Caesarem a finibus suis expellerent.
Quod Iulius callens noluit anceps bellum cum feroci populo committere
sed apertis thesauris quosque nobiliores adire
ut singulos munificatos in concordiam reduceret.
Plebi libertatem pollicetur, exheredatis amissas possessiones,
seruis etiam libertatem.
Qui prius leonina feritate fulminans ipsis omnia abstulerat
nunc mitis agnus humili uoce balans omnia posse reddere laetatur;
nec ab his blandiciis quieuit donec pacificatis cunctis amissam potestatem recuperauit.
Nullus interim dies praeteribat quin fugam suam Britonumque uictoriam recoleret. 
========================================
And so, after Julius turned back and landed on the shore of Gaul,
the Gauls revolted, casting aside Julius' dominion;
for they observed him so much weakened that they had no more fear of him at all.
Then too, the rumor that hit everyone all together and at once was
that the whole sea now boiled with Cassibellaunus' ships, pursuing his flight.
Pressing on more boldly from this, they thought of how to drive Caesar
from their country.
And when Julius knew of this, he didn't want to engage in a two-front war with
a fierce nation, but instead opened his treasure chests and approached
each of the nobles, to bring each one back into amity.
To the commoners he promised freedom,
to the disinherited the possessions that they'd lost,
and even freedom to the slaves.
He, who previously had carried everything off for himself,
striking like lightning with the savagery of a lion,
now bleated in a humble voice, like a meek lamb,
glad that he could return it all;
and he did not rest from these blandishments until he'd pacified everyone
and regained his lost power.
Meanwhile, not one day passed that he didn't mull over his flight and the
Britons' victory.
========================================

Emenso itaque biennio,
parat iterum occeanum transfretare et sese in Cassibellaunum uindicare.
Quod cum Cassibellaunus comperisset, urbes ubique muniuit,
diruta moenia renouauit, armatos milites in singulis portibus statuit.
Praeterea alueo Tamensis fluminis,
quo ad urbem Trinouantum Caesar nauigaturus erat,
palis ferreis atque plumbatis et ad modum humani femoris grossis subtus amnem
infixit ut naues Iulii superuenturae illiderentur.
Collecta etiam tota iuuentute insulae,
mansionem iuxta maritima fecit aduentum hostium expectans. 

Iulius autem, cum omnia quae sibi necessaria essent parauisset,
cum innumerabili multitudine militum mare ingressus est,
optatam stragem populo qui eum deuicerat inferre affectans.

Quam procul dubio ingessisset si illaesa classe tellure potiri quiuisset,
quod ad effectum ducere nequiuit.
========================================
And so after two years had passed, he again prepared to cross the ocean and to
avenge himself on Cassibellaunus.
But after Cassibellaunus learned of this, he fortified his cities everywhere,
restoring their walls, and set armed soldiers in every port.
In addition, in the channel of the River Thames, which Caesar had to sail up
to get to the city of Trinouantum, he drove in iron and lead stakes,
as thick as a human thigh, under the water,
so that when Julius' ships arrived they would be dashed against them.
Also, he assembled all the young men of the island and
staged them near the sea, waiting for the arrival of the enemy.

Now when Julius had prepared everything that he needed, 
he put out to sea with an innumerable multitude of soldiers,
aiming to carry out a hoped-for slaughter on the people who had defeated him.
And he would have undoubtedly carried it off if he'd been able to reach
land with an undamaged fleet, but he was not able to bring this about.
========================================

Nam dum per Tamensem praedictam ciuitatem peteret, naues eius,
praefatis palis infixae, subitum passae sunt periculum;
unde ad milia submergebantur milites dum ipsas foratas ingrediens fluuius absorberet.
Cumque id Caesari compertum esset,
uelis maxima ui retortis ad terram reuertere festinauit.
Ipsi quoque qui in tanto periculo superfuerant uix elapsi cum illo tellurem scandunt.
Hoc igitur Cassibellaunus ex ripa qua aderat aspiciens gaudet 
propter periculum submersorum sed tristatur ob salutem ceterorum.
Dato uero commilitonibus suis signo, impetum in Romanos facit.
At Romani, quamquam periculum in fluuio perpessi fuissent,
ut terra potiti sunt uiriliter Britonum irruptioni restiterunt.
Audatiam quoque pro muro habentes, stragem non minimam fecerunt,
sed tamen maiorem paciuntur quam inferebant. 
========================================
For when he attacked the aforesaid city via the Thames, his ships,
pierced by the aforesaid stakes, endured a sudden peril;
and from this thousands of soldiers were drowned as the river,
entering into the gangways themselves, engulfed them.
And when this was discovered to Caesar, he shifted the sails
with the great force and hastened to ground themselves.
The men who had survived such peril by the skin of their teeth
clambered to land with him.
Now Cassibellaunus saw this from the shore and rejoiced for the drowned men,
but was downcast about the safety of the others.
He gave the signal to his fellow soldiers and launched a charge on the Romans.
But although the Romans had nearly lost their lives in the river,
they manfully resisted the the Britons' assualt as they gained the land.
And they audaciously produced a non-trifling slaughter before the city wall,
but yet bore worse than they inflicted.


Periclitati namque in fluuio, pauciores incedebant, Britones 
uero, omni hora affluentia suorum augmentati, tricies maiorem numerum
