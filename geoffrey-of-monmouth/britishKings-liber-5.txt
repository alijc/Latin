LIBER V

Interea gloriosus ille rex Lucius,
cum infra regnum suum cultum uerae fidei magnificatum esse uidisset,
maximo gaudio fluctuans possessiones et territoria
quae prius templa idolorum possederant
in meliorem usum uertens ipsa ecclesiis fidelium permanere concessit.
Et quia maiorem honorem ipsis impendere debuerat,
augmentauit illas amplioribus agris et mansis omnique libertate sublimauit.
Inter haec et ceteros propositi sui actus in urbe Claudiocestriae ab hac uita
migrauit et in ecclesia primae sedis honorifice sepultus est anno
ab incarnatione Domini .clvi.
Caruerat ipse sobole quae sibi succederet, unde defuncto illo et
discidium inter Britones ortum fuit et Romana potestas infirmata.

Cumque id Romae nuntiatum fuisset, legauerunt senatus Seuerum senatorem duasque
legiones cum illo ut patriam Romanae potestati restituerent.
Qui ut appulsus fuit, proelium commisit cum Britonibus partemque sibi submisit,
partem uero illam quam subiugare nequibat diris debellationibus infestare
laborauit ita ut eam trans Deiram in Albaniam fugaret. 
=========================================================================
Meanwhile, when that glorious king Lucius
saw that the true faith was cultvated in his kingdom,
he swelled with the greatest joy and relinquished the possessions and
territories that the temples to idols had previously possessed,
turning them to a better use to remain as churches for the faithful.
And because he was obliged to expend greater honor to these, he augmented them
with greater fields and dwellings and elevated them with every liberty. 
In the midst of these and other deeds of his intention
he took leave of this life in the city of Gloucester
and was honorably buried in the church of the first rank
in the year of the incarnation of the Lord 156.
He himself had had no offspring to succeed him, and from this a quarrel
sprang up among the Britons and Roman power was weakened after his death.

And when this was reported in Rome, the senate chose Senator Severus
and gave him two legions to restore the country to Roman power.
As he put ashore, he engaged in battle with the Britons and
conquered a part of them, while he labored to harass the part that he couldn't
subjugate with dire fighting so that they fled across the Deira into Scotland.
=========================================================================

At illa duce Fulgenio omni nisu resistebat
saepiusque stragem maximam et conciuibus et Romanis inferebat.
Conducebat autem in auxilium sibi quoscumque insulanos populos inueniebat
et sic multociens cum uictoria redibat.
Irruptionem igitur eius grauiter ferens imperator iussit construi uallum
inter Deiram et Albaniam ut impetum eius propius accedere prohiberet.
Communicato igitur sumptu, fecerunt illud a mari usque ad mare,
quod multo tempore post hostium accessus detinuit.
At Fulgenius, cum diutius Seuero resistere nequiuisset,
transfretauit in Scithiam ut Pictorum auxilio dignitati restitueretur;
cumque ibi omnem iuuentutem patriae collegisset,
reuersus est maximo nauigio in Britanniam atque Eboracum obsedit.
=========================================================================
Then with Fulgenius as leader, the people resisted every assault
and often imposed great slaughter on both fellow citizens and Romans.
They collected whatever island people they found for their aid
and so returned with victory many times.
And so, violently vexed by their attacks, the emperor ordered a wall
to be built between Deira and Scotland to fend off the attacks.
And so, with the cost shared, they built that wall from sea to sea,
and it held off the enemy's approach for a long time afterwards.
But when Fulgenius could no longer resist Severus, he crossed over to Scythia
so that, with the Picts' aid, he might be restored to his honors;
and after rallying all the young men of the country there
he returned to Britain on a very large ship and besieged York.
=========================================================================

Quod cum per ceteras nationes diuulgatum esset,
maxima pars Britonum Seuerum deseruit et ad Fulgenium abiuit.
Nec ob id ab inceptis suis destitutus est Seuerus
sed conuocatis Romanis ceterisque Britonibus
qui sibi adhaerebant obsidionem petiuit et cum Fulgenio dimicauit;
sed cum pugnam acrius confecisset,
interfectus est cum multis suorum et Fulgenius letaliter uulneratus est.
Exin sepultus est Eboraci, quam legiones eius optinuerunt.
Reliquit ipse duos filios,
Bassianum et Getam, quorum Geta Romana matre genitus erat,
Bassianus uero Britannica.
Defuncto igitur patre, sublimauerunt Romani Getam in regem,
fauentes illi quia ex utraque parte Romanus fuerat;
quod abnegantes Britanni Bassianum elegerunt
quia materno sanguine ipsis coniunctus erat.
=========================================================================
After news of this spread through the other nations 
most of the Britons deserted Severus and went over to Fulgenius.
But Severus didn't abandon his undertaking on account of this,
but mustered the Romans and the rest of the Britons,
who stuck together and attacked the siege and did battle with Fulgenius;
and when the bitter fight was over,
he was killed, along with many of his men, and Fulgenius was mortally wounded.
Afterwards Fulgenius was buried in York, which his legions held.
He left two sons, Bassianus and Geta, of whom Geta was born of a Roman mother,
and Bassianus a British one.
And so, upon their father's demise, the Romans elevated Geta to the kingship,
favoring him because he was the Roman son;
while the Britons rejected this and chose Bassianus
since he was connected to them by his mother's blood.
=========================================================================

Proinde commiserunt pugnam fratres, unde Geta interficitur et Bassianus regno potitur.
Eo tempore fuerat in Britannia iuuenis quidam nomine Carausius,
ex infima gente creatus,
qui cum probitatem suam in multis debellationibus examinasset profectus est
Romam petiuitque licentiam a senatu
ut maritima Britanniae ab incursione barbarica nauigiis tueretur;
quod si in sibi committeretur,
promittebat se tot et tanta adepturum quibus rem publicam magis augmentaret
quam si sibi regnum Britanniae traderetur.
Cumque senatum promissis suis illusisset,
impetrauit quod poposcerat et cum sigillatis cartis in Britanniam rediuit.
Mox, collectis nauibus, asciuit sibi magnam uirtutem iuuentutis patriae et
ingressus est mare et circuiuit omnia littora regni et maximum tumultum per
populum faciebat. 
=========================================================================
Then the brothers engaged in battle -
Geta was killed and Bassianus acquired the kingdom.
At the time there was a young man in Britain called Carausius,
born of the humblest tribe.
And after he'd proved his worth by winning many battles he set out for Rome
and sought a license from the senate to protect the British coastline
from foreign incursions with ships.
And if this was entrusted to him, he promised that he'd gain so much
that he'd augment the republic more than if the kingdom of Britain
had been given to him.
And after he'd duped the senate with his promises,
he got what he'd asked for and returned to Britain with letters with seals.
Next, after collecting ships, he took over a great army of the
young men of the country and put to sea and went along the whole coastline of
the kingdom, producing a great tumult through the nation.


Interea, comprouincialibus insulis appulsus, agros populando, ciuitates et oppida diruendo, incolis emnia sua eripiebat. Sic igitur ipso agente, confluebant ad illum quicumque in aliena anhelabant, ita ut in breui tantum haberet exercitum quanto aullus uicinus princeps resistere quiuisset. Ob hoc itaque tumidum habens animum, dixit Britonibus ut sese sibi facerent regem et ipse interfectis atque exterminatis Romanis totam insulam a barbara gente liberaret. Quod cum impetrauisset, dimicauit confestim cum Bassiano et interfecit eum et gubernaculum regni suscepit. Prodiderant enim Bassianum Picti quos dux Fulgenius, matris suae frater, in Britanniam conduxerat; nam dum sibi auxiliari debuissent, promissis et donariis Carausii corrupti in ipso proelio diuerterunt se a Bassiano et in commilitones suos irruerunt, unde stupefacti ceteri, cum ignorarent quis socius esset, quis hostis, ocius dilabuntur, et uictoria cessit Carausio. Qui ut triumphum habuit, dedit Pictis locum mansionis in Albania, ubi cum Britonibus mixti per subsequens
aeuum permanserunt. 76 Cum igitur inuasio Carausii Romae nunciata fuisset, legauit senatus Allectum cum tribus legionibus ut tyrannum interficeret regnumque Britanniae Romanae potestati restitueret. Nec mora, postquam appulsus fuit, proeliatus est cum Carausio ipsoque interfecto solium regni suscepit. nia relicta re publica societati
