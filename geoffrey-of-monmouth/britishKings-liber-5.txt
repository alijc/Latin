LIBER V

Interea gloriosus ille rex Lucius,
cum infra regnum suum cultum uerae fidei magnificatum esse uidisset,
maximo gaudio fluctuans possessiones et territoria
quae prius templa idolorum possederant
in meliorem usum uertens ipsa ecclesiis fidelium permanere concessit.
Et quia maiorem honorem ipsis impendere debuerat,
augmentauit illas amplioribus agris et mansis omnique libertate sublimauit.
Inter haec et ceteros propositi sui actus in urbe Claudiocestriae ab hac uita
migrauit et in ecclesia primae sedis honorifice sepultus est anno
ab incarnatione Domini .clvi.
Caruerat ipse sobole quae sibi succederet, unde defuncto illo et
discidium inter Britones ortum fuit et Romana potestas infirmata.

Cumque id Romae nuntiatum fuisset, legauerunt senatus Seuerum senatorem duasque
legiones cum illo ut patriam Romanae potestati restituerent.
Qui ut appulsus fuit, proelium commisit cum Britonibus partemque sibi submisit,
partem uero illam quam subiugare nequibat diris debellationibus infestare
laborauit ita ut eam trans Deiram in Albaniam fugaret. 
=========================================================================
Meanwhile, when that glorious king Lucius
saw that the true faith was cultvated in his kingdom,
he swelled with the greatest joy and relinquished the possessions and
territories that the temples to idols had previously possessed,
turning them to a better use to remain as churches for the faithful.
And because he was obliged to expend greater honor to these, he augmented them
with greater fields and dwellings and elevated them with every liberty. 
In the midst of these and other deeds of his intention
he took leave of this life in the city of Gloucester
and was honorably buried in the church of the first rank
in the year of the incarnation of the Lord 156.
He himself had had no offspring to succeed him, and from this a quarrel
sprang up among the Britons and Roman power was weakened after his death.

And when this was reported in Rome, the senate chose Senator Severus
and gave him two legions to restore the country to Roman power.
As he put ashore, he engaged in battle with the Britons and
conquered a part of them, while he labored to harass the part that he couldn't
subjugate with dire fighting so that they fled across the Deira into Scotland.

At illa duce Fulgenio omni nisu resistebat
saepiusque stragem maximam et conciuibus et Romanis inferebat.
Conducebat autem in auxilium sibi quoscumque insulanos populos inueniebat
et sic multociens cum uictoria redibat.
Irruptionem igitur eius grauiter ferens imperator iussit construi uallum
inter Deiram et Albaniam ut impetum eius propius accedere prohiberet.
Communicato igitur sumptu, fecerunt illud a mari usque ad mare,
quod multo tempore post hostium accessus detinuit.
At Fulgenius, cum diutius Seuero resistere nequiuisset,
transfretauit in Scithiam ut Pictorum auxilio dignitati restitueretur;
cumque ibi omnem iuuentutem patriae collegisset,
reuersus est maximo nauigio in Britanniam atque Eboracum obsedit.
=========================================================================
But with Fulgenius as leader, the people resisted every assault
and often imposed great slaughter on both fellow citizens and Romans.
But they collected whatever island people they found for their aid
and so returned with victory many times.
And so, violently vexed by their attacks, the emperor ordered a wall
to be built between Deira and Scotland to keep the attacks from coming nearer.
And so, with the cost shared, they built that wall from sea to sea,
and it held off the enemy's approach for a long time afterwards.
But when Fulgenius could no longer resist Severus, he crossed over to Scythia
so that, with the Picts' aid, he might be restored to his honors;
and after rallying all the young men of the country there
he returned to Britain on a very large ship and besieged York.


Quod cum per ceteras nationes diuulgatum esset, maxima pars Britonum Seuerum deseruit et ad Fulgenium abiuit. Nec ob id ab inceptis suis destitutus est Seuerus sed conuocatis Romanis ceterisque Britonibus qui sibi adhaerebant obsidionem petiuit et cum Fulgenio dimicauit; sed cum pugnam acrius confecisset, interfectus est cum multis suorum et Fulgenius letaliter uulneratus est. Exin sepultus est Eboraci, quam legiones eius optinuerunt. Reliquit ipse duos filios, Bassianum et Getam, quorum Geta Romana matre genitus
