			    PROLOGVS	Prologue

1. Cum mecum multa et de multis saepius animo reuoluens in hystoriam
regum Britanniae inciderem, in mirum contuli quod infra mentionem
quam de eis Gildas et Beda luculento tractatu fecerant nichil de regibus
qui ante incarnationem Christi inhabitauerant, nichil etiam de Arturo
ceterisque compluribus qui post incarnationem successerunt repperissem,
cum et gesta eorum digna aeternitate laudis constarent et a multis populis
quasi inscripta iocunde et memoriter praedicentur.

When, with my mind often mulling over many things in many ways,
I happened upon a history of the kings of Britain, I found it
remarkable that, after a mention that Gildas and Bede made about
them in a brilliant treatise, I discovered nothing about the kings
who had lived before the incarnation of Christ, nothing even about
Arthur and the many others who followed him after it, considering
that their deeds were worthy of eternal renown and are proclaimed
by many nations as if they'd been written down delightfully and
memorably.

2. Talia michi et de talibus
multociens cogitanti optulit Walterus Oxenefordensis archidiaconus, uir
in oratoria arte atque in exoticis hystoriis eruditus, quendam Britannici
sermonis librum uetustissimum qui a Bruto primo rege Britonum usque
ad Cadualadrum filium Caduallonis actus omnium continue et ex ordine
perpulcris orationibus proponebat. Rogatu itaque illius ductus, tametsi
infra alienos ortulos falerata uerba non collegerim, agresti tamen stilo
proprisque calamis contentus codicem illum in Latinum sermonem
transferre curaui; nam si ampullosis dictionibus paginam illinissem, taedium
legentibus ingererem, dum magis in exponendis uerbis quam in historia
intelligenda ipsos commorari oporteret.

While I was pondered such things, from this side and that, 
Walter, the archdeacon of Oxford,
an man learned in oratorical skill and in foreign histories,
presented me with an ancient book in the British tongue,
which described the deeds of all the kings,
from Brutus, the first king of the Britons,
up to Cadualadrus, the son of Caduallo,
in order in one long line in beautiful orations.
And so, led by his request,
even though I haven't collected ornate words from foreign gardens,
I still set about to copy that book into Latin,
content with a rustic style and my own reed-pen;
for if I had besmeared the page with bombastic speech,
I would have forced tedium upon those reading it,
as it is better for the history itself be understood,
than to get bogged down in understanding the words themselves.

3. Opusculo igitur meo, Roberte dux
Claudiocestriae, faueas, ut sic te doctore te monitore corrigatur quod non
ex Galfridi Monemutensis fonticulo censeatur exortum sed sale mineruae
tuae conditum illius dicatur editio quem Henricus illustris rex Anglorum
generauit, quem philosophia liberalibus artibus erudiuit, quem innata
probitas in militia militibus praefecit; unde Britannia tibi nunc temporibus
nostris ac si alterum Henricum adepta interno congratulatur affectu.

May you therefore, Robert, duke of Gloucester, find favor with my trifling work,
so that it might be set right by you, as teacher and counselor,
for it should not be supposed to have arisen from the small spring of
Geoffrey of Monmouth,
but by the wit of your minerva
the establishment of which may be called the edition
which Henry the illustrious king of the English produced,
which philosophy educated in the arts,
which innate worth put in charge of soldiers in military matters;
whence Britain was won for you now in our times
and/as? if a second Henry
with inward affection/emotion it congratulates/is congratulated.
