<p>I. THE WONDERS OF INDIA
</p>

<p>
Mense Maio, postquam vicimus Darium, regem Persarum,
apud flumen qui dicebatur Granicus, subiugavimus nobis
omnem illius terram et posuimus in provinciis orientis nostros
honoratos, et divites facti sumus de multis divitiis, sicut iam
tibi in priore epistola significavi. 
</p>
<blockquote>
In the month of May, after we had conquered Darius, the king of
Persia, along the river that was called Granicus, we made all
of that land subject to us and stationed our honored men in the
eastern provinces, and we became rich from the great wealth, as
I have already shown you in a previous letter.
</blockquote>

<p>
Sed ne videatur multiplicata ipsa locutio, non replicabo facta
priora, quae cognita sunt.  Mense Iulio deficiente venimus in
Indiam Phasiacen, ubi cum magna celeritate Porum regem vicimus,
et omnes divites facti sumus de multis divitiis illius.
</p>
<blockquote>
But, so that the speech itself should not seem overdone, I won't
repeat the previous facts that are already known.  In the month
of July we came, lacking numbers, to India, where with great
speed with conquered King Porus, and we all became rich from that
great wealth.
</blockquote>

<p>
Et ut semper in memoria teneatur, rectum mihi videtur ut
scribam de multitudine exercitus eius, in quo fuerunt sine
peditibus quattuordecim milia octingentae quadrigae, omnes
falcatae, et quadringenti elephanti, qui portabant turres, ubi
stabant homines armati ad pugnandum, et apprehendimus ipsam
civitatem Pori et domum eius, in qua fuerunt quadringentae
columnae aureae cum capitellis aureis, et parietes illius
domus erant investiti de laminis aureis, quae erant grossae,
quantum est grossus unus digitus hominis de manu; etiam ego
ipsas laminas incidere feci in multis locis.
</p>
<blockquote>
And so that it be forever held in memory, it seems right to me
that I should write about his many armies, in which were,
besides the foot soldiers, 14,800 four-horse chariots, all
armed with scythes, and 400 elephants that bore towers where
armed men stood for battle. And we captured Porus' city and his
palace, in which were 400 columns of gold, with capitals of
gold, and the walls of his palace were covered with sheets of
gold, each as thick as a man's finger; as indeed I did cut into
these sheets in many places.
</blockquote>

<p>
Vinea quoque de auro pendebat inter columnas, quae folia aurea
habebat, et racemi illius erant de crystallo, et interpositas
habebant gemmas ignitas et smaragdos, et omnes ipsae mansiones
erant ornatae de gemmis quae margaritae nominantur, et de
unionibus et carbunculis.
</p>
<blockquote>
Likewise vines of gold hung between the columns, which
had golden leaves, and the clusters of grapes were crystal, and
they had fiery gems and emeralds inset, and all of its rooms
were decorated with the gems that are called pearls, and with
single large pearls and carbuncles.
</blockquote>

<p>
Regias vero habebant de ebore albo, habebant et lacunaria,
id est subficta de ligno, quod nominatur ebenum, et est
lignum fuscum quod nascitur in India et Aethiopia, et camerae
erant factae de lignis cupresseis.
</p>
<blockquote>
Indeed the doors were made of white ivory, and had ceilings of
the wood that is called ebony and is a dark wood that grows in
India and Ethiopia, and the arches were made of cypress.
</blockquote>

<p>
Et foras ipsam domum erant statuae de auro positae, et erant
ibi platani aurei, et inter illas erant multa genera de
aucellis cum variis coloribus, et habebant ungulas et rostra
inaurata et in auriculis pendebant eis margaritae et uniones.
</p>
<blockquote>
And outside this house were set statues of gold, and there
were plane trees of gold, and between these were many kinds of
small birds with different colors, and they had gilded claws
and beaks and large and small pearls hung in their ears.
</blockquote>

<p>
Multa vasa gemmea et crystallina seu et aurea invenimus ibi, de argento
pauca.
</p>
<blockquote>
We found many vessels set with gems or made of crystal and even
gold there, but few of silver.
</blockquote>

<p>
Cumque omnia in mea habuissem potestate, desideravi
videre interiorem Indiam, et perveni ad portas Caspias cum
universo exercitu; ubi cum admirarer ipsam terram, quae erat
bona, cognovi ibi aliqua quae odiosa mihi videbantur esse.
</p>
<blockquote>
And when I had had everything in my power, I desired to see
the interior of India, and reached the Caspian gates with my
entire army; where, though I regarded with wonder that fair
land, I learned something there that seemed to be troublesome
to me.
</blockquote>

<p>
In ipsis autem locis erant diversi serpentes et ferae, quae in
ipsis vallibus et campis et silvis et montibus habitabant, et
dixerunt nobis homines de ipsa terra, ut essemus solliciti pro
ipsis serpentibus et feris. 
</p>
<blockquote>
Now in these places there were various fierce snakes, that
lived in those valleys and fields and woods and mountatins, and
men told us about that land, so that we'd be concerned about
these fierce snakes.
</blockquote>

<p>
Sed ego volendo persequi Porum regem, qui de proelio
fugerat, antequam in desertas solitudines abiret, tuli
centum quinquaginta duces, qui ipsam viam noverant; et mense
Augusto perreximus per ardentissimum solem et per loca arenosa,
et promisi praemia illis, qui me portabant per incognita
loca Indiae, si me perducerent in Bactriacen cum omni exercitu
meo salvo, ubi sunt gentes quae nominantur Seres, et sunt ibi
arbores habentes ipsa folia velut lanam, quam homines
loci illius colligunt et vestimenta sibi exinde faciunt.
</p>
<blockquote>
But I willingly pursued King Porus, who had fled the battle,
and was running away into the deserted wilderness.  I took 150
guides who knew that road; and in the month of August we
proceeded under the burning sun and through sandy places, and
I promised a reward to those who conducted me through the
unknown places of India, if they would lead me into Bactriaca
with all of my army safe, where there are tribes that are
called Seres, and there are trees there that have leaves like
fleece, that men of that place collect and make into garments
for themselves.
</blockquote>

<p>
Nam et ipsi duces nostri coeperunt de eadem lanugine colligere.
</p>
<blockquote>
Even our own generals began to gather this down.
</blockquote>

<p>
Illi namque qui nobis viam ostendebant, sicut ego cognoscere
potui, volebant nos portare per loca mortalia, ubi erat
multitudo serpentium et ferarum et beluarum.
</p>
<blockquote>
Those who were showing us the way, as I was able to learn,
wished to bring us through the death-zones, where there were
many wild and fierce snakes.
</blockquote>

<p>
Quod ego ut vidi, ex parte pro culpa mea hoc evenire dixi,
quia despexi consilia de amicis meis et de hominibus de loco
Caspiae, qui dixerunt mihi ut non sic festinarem vincere.
</p>
<blockquote>
Because as I saw it, from the part for my guilt I said that this
would happen, since I scorned the advice of my friends and the
local Caspians, who told me not to hurry to conquer.
</blockquote>

<p>
Praecepi militibus meis ut omnes se armarent eo quod timebam
ne forte supervenirent hostes et tollerent divitias auri et
gemmarum, quas milites mei portabant.
</p>
<blockquote>
I instructed all my soldiers to arm themselves because
I feared that the enemy might arrive and take away the
wealth of gold and jewels that my soldiers were carrying.
</blockquote>

<p>
Tantum enim erant divites facti, qui vix ipsum aurum portare
poterant; insuper et ipsa arma gravabant multum, quia omnia
ego feceram includere in auro, et resplendebat totus exercitus
meus ad similitudinem stellarum; et erat magna admiratio
videre talem exercitum, quia et in ornamento et in virtute
supra erant quam aliae gentes.
</p>
<blockquote>
For they'd already gotten wealth, so that they could barely
carry the gold; on top of the arms that they were weighed down
with, for I'd included everyone in the gold, and my whole army
glittered like stars, and it was a marvel to see such an army,
for both in equipment and strength they were above other people.
</blockquote>

<p>
Ego certe videndo prosperitatem meam nimium gaudebam de
nobilissimo numero iuventutis.
</p>
<blockquote>
Considering my good fortune, I was too happy about the noble
rank of youth.
</blockquote>

<p>
Sed quia solet aliquando, ubi habet homo prosperitatem,
sequuntur illum adversa, coepimus sitim habere maiorem.
</p>
<blockquote>
But since it's always habitual, when a man has good fortune,
that adversity follows it, we started to get very thirsty.
</blockquote>

<p>
Quam
cum non potuissemus durare, tunc quidam miles, Zefirus
nomine, invenit aquam in una petra cavata; implevit exinde
ipsum cassidem suum et adduxit illam mihi, quia plus amavit
vitam meam quam se ipsum.
</p>
<blockquote>
Whennnn what we hadn't been able to endure, then a certain
soldier, Zefirus by name, found water in a hollowed out rock;
then he filled his helmet and carried it to me, for he loved
my life more than his own.
</blockquote>

<p>
Ego vero convocavi exercitum meum et coram omnibus effudi
ipsam aquam in terrain, ne forte, dum videret ipse exercitus
quia biberem ego ipse aquam, plus inciperent illi sitire.
</p>
<blockquote>
Indeed I called together my army and in front of them all
purposely poured the water out onto the ground while the army
saw that I myself drank, they began to thirst even more.
</blockquote>

<p>
Laudavi bonitatem Zefiri
quam habuit in me, et dona ei optima feci. 
</p>
<blockquote>
I praised the kindness that Zefirus had for me, and showered
gifts upon him.  
</blockquote>

<p>
Ista namque causa, quae facta est de ipsa aqua, confortavit
ipsum exercitum et deinde coepimus ire.
</p>
<blockquote>
For this action about the water, the army was fortified and
thereupon began to march.
