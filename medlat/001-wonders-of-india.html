<p>I. THE WONDERS OF INDIA
</p>

<p>
Mense Maio, postquam vicimus Darium, regem Persarum,
apud flumen qui dicebatur Granicus, subiugavimus nobis
omnem illius terram et posuimus in provinciis orientis nostros
honoratos, et divites facti sumus de multis divitiis, sicut iam
tibi in priore epistola significavi. 
</p>
<blockquote>
In the month of May, after we had conquered Darius, the king of
Persia, along the river that was called Granicus, we made all
of that land subject to us and stationed our honored men in the
eastern provinces, and we became rich from the great wealth, as
I have already shown you in a previous letter.
</blockquote>

<p>
Sed ne videatur multiplicata ipsa locutio, non replicabo facta
priora, quae cognita sunt.  Mense Iulio deficiente venimus in
Indiam Phasiacen, ubi cum magna celeritate Porum regem vicimus,
et omnes divites facti sumus de multis divitiis illius.
</p>
<blockquote>
But, so that the very speech should not seem redone, I won't
repeat the previous facts that are already known.  In the month
of July we came, lacking numbers, to India, where with great
speed with conquered King Porus, and all became rich from that
great wealth.
</blockquote>

<p>
Et ut semper in memoria teneatur, rectum mihi videtur ut
scribam de multitudine exercitus eius, in quo fuerunt sine
peditibus quattuordecim milia octingentae quadrigae, omnes
falcatae, et quadringenti elephanti, qui portabant turres, ubi
stabant homines armati ad pugnandum, et apprehendimus ipsam
civitatem Pori et domum eius, in qua fuerunt quadringentae
columnae aureae cum capitellis aureis, et parietes illius
domus erant investiti de laminis aureis, quae erant grossae,
quantum est grossus unus digitus hominis de manu; etiam ego
ipsas laminas incidere feci in multis locis.
</p>
<blockquote>
And so let it be forever held in memory, it seems right to me
that I should write about his many armies, in which were,
besides the foot soldiers, 14,800 four-horse chariots, all
armed with scythes, 400 elephants, which carried towers, where
armed men stood for battle, and we captured Porus' city and his
palace, in which were 400 columns of gold, with capitals of
gold, and the walls of his palace were covered with sheets of
gold, each as thick as a man's finger; as indeed I did cut into
these sheets in many places.
</blockquote>

<p>
Vinea quoque de auro pendebat inter columnas, quae folia aurea
habebat, et racemi illius erant de crystallo, et interpositas
habebant gemmas ignitas et smaragdos, et omnes ipsae mansiones
erant ornatae de gemmis quae margaritae nominantur, et de
unionibus et carbunculis.
</p>
<blockquote>
Likewise vines of gold hung between the columns, which
had golden leaves, and the clusters of grapes were crystal, and
they had fiery gems and emeralds inset, and all of its rooms
were decorated with the gems that are called pearls, and with
single large pearls and carbunkles.
</blockquote>

<p>
Regias 14 vero habebant de ebore albo, habebant et lacunaria,
id est subficta de ligno, quod nominatur ebenum, et est
lignum fuscum quod nascitur in India et Aethiopia, et camerae
erant factae de lignis cupresseis. Et foras ipsam domum
erant statuae de auro positae, et erant ibi platani aurei, et
inter illas erant multa genera de aucellis cum variis
coloribus, et habebant ungulas et rostra inaurata et in
auriculis pendebant eis margaritae et uniones.
</p>
<blockquote>
Indeed the doors were made of white ivory, and had ceilings of
the wood that is called ebony, and is a dark wood that grows in
India and Ethiopia, and the arches were made of cypress.  And
outside this house were set statues of gold, and there were
plane trees of gold, and between these were many kinds of small
birds with different colors, and they had gilded claws and
beaks and large and small pearls hung in their ears.  
</blockquote>

<p>
Multa vasa gemmea et crystallina seu et aurea invenimus ibi, de argento
pauca.
</p>
<blockquote>
We found many vessels set with gems or made of crystal and even
gold there, but few of silver.
</blockquote>

<p>
Cumque omnia in mea habuissem potestate, desideravi
videre interiorem Indiam, et perveni ad portas Caspias cum
universo exercitu; ubi cum admirarer ipsam terram, quae erat
bona, cognovi ibi aliqua quae odiosa mihi videbantur esse.
</p>
<blockquote>
And when I had had everything in my power, I desired to see the
interior of India, and reached the Caspian gates with my entire
army; where, though I regarded with wonder that land, which was
good, I recognized something there that seemed to be distasteful to me.
</blockquote>

<p>
In ipsis autem locis erant diversi serpentes et ferae, quae in
ipsis vallibus et campis et silvis et montibus habitabant, et
dixerunt nobis homines de ipsa terra, ut essemus solliciti pro
ipsis serpentibus et feris. 
</p>
<blockquote>
Now in these places there were various fierce snakes, that
lived in those valleys and fields and woods and mountatins, and
men told us about that land, so that we'd be concerned about
these fierce snakes.
</blockquote>

<p>
Sed ego volendo persequi Porum regem, qui de proelio
fugerat, antequam in desertas solitudines abiret, tuli
centum quinquaginta duces, qui ipsam viam noverant; et mense
Augusto perreximus per ardentissimum solem et per loca arenosa,
et promisi praemia illis, qui me portabant per incognita
loca Indiae, si me perducerent in Bactriacen cum omni exercitu
meo salvo, ubi sunt gentes quae nominantur Seres, et sunt ibi
arbores habentes ipsa folia velut lanam, quam homines
loci illius colligunt et vestimenta sibi exinde faciunt.
</p>
<blockquote>
But I willingly pursued King Porus, who had fled the battle,
and was running away into the deserted wilderness.  I took 150
guides, who had learned that way; and in the month of August we
proceeded under the burning sun and through sandy places, and I
promised a reward to those who conducted me through the unknown
places of India, if they would lead me into Bactriaca with all
of my army safe, where there are tribes that are called Seres,
and there are trees there that have leaves like fleece, that
men of that place collect and make into garments for themselves.
