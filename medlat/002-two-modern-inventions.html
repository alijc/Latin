<h4>Two Modern Inventions</h4>

<p>
<!--
Abinde venimus ad mare rubrum. Et erat ibi mons altus;
ascendimus eum et quasi essemus in caelo.
-->
 From there we came to a red sea. And there was a high
 mountain there.  We climbed it and it was as if we
 were in the sky.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Cogitavi cum amicis meis ut instruerem tale ingenium
quatenus ascenderem caelum et viderem si est hoc caelum
quod videmus. 
-->
 I and my friends discovered that I might construct
 such a device that I might climb up the sky and
 see if this was the sky that we saw.

<!-- 
Praeparavi ingenium ubi sederem et apprehendi
griphas atque ligui eas cum catenis et posui
vectes ante eos et in summitate eorum cibaria
illorum et coeperunt ascendere caelum.  
-->
 I prepared a device where I might sit and seized
 griffins and bound them with chains and put poles
 before them and hung food for them over their heads
 and they began to climb into the sky.

<!--
Divina quidem virtus obumbrans eos deiecit ad terram
longius ab exercitu meo iter dierum decem in loco
campestri et nullam laesionem sustinui in ipsis
cancellis ferreis.
-->
 Truly, a divine power overshadowed them and cast them
 down to earth on a level spot a ten days' journey
 away from my army, and I sustained no harm within
 the iron bars.

<!-- 
Tantam altitudinem ascendi ut sicut area videbatur
esse terra sub me. Mare autem ita videbatur mihi sicut
draco gyrans eam et cum forti angustia iunctus sum
militibus meis.  Videntes 11 me exercitus meus
acclamaverunt laudantes me.
-->
 I had climbed to such a height such that the ground
 seemed to be the earth beneath me.  But the sea seemed
 to me like a circling snake and only with great difficulty
 was I reunited with my soldiers.  When my army saw me
 they shouted in my praise. 
</p>

<p>
<!-- 
Venit iterum in cor meum ut mensurarem fundum
maris.  Feci venire astrologos et geometricos
praecepique illis ut construerent mihi vasculum in quo
valerem descendere in profundum maris et perquirere
admirabiles bestias quae ibi habitant.
-->
 It came again into my heart to measure the depth of
 the sea.  I had astronomers and geometers come and
 ordered them to construct for me a vessel in which I
 might be able to descend into the depths of the sea
 and seek out the marvelous creatures that live there.

<!-- 
Illi dicebant hoc fieri non posse nisi tali modo:
faciamus doleum olovitreum et ligetur catenis et
regant eum fortissimi milites. 
-->
 They said that this couldn't be done except by this
 way: let us make a large glass jar and let it be
 fastened with chains and let the strongest soldiers
 guide it.

<!-- 
Hoc audito praecepi cito talia facere et tali modo
perquisivi profundum maris. 
-->
 After listening to this I commanded them to quickly
 make such a thing, and in that way I searched the
 depths of the sea.

<!-- 
Vidi ibi diversas figuras piscium atque ex diversis
coloribus; vidi ibi et alias bestias habentes imagines
terrenarum bestiarum, ambulantes per fundum maris
quasi quadrupedia.
-->
 I saw there different forms and colors of fish; I
 also saw there other animals that had the appearence
 of terrestrial animals, walking through the depths of
 the sea like quadrupeds.

<!-- 
Veniebant usque ad me et fugiebant. Vidi ibi et alias
admirabiles causas quas recitare non possum. Gaude mi,
karissima mater.
-->
 They would come right up to me and then flee.  I also
 saw other marvelous things there that I can't
 describe.  Be happy for me, dearest mother.
