<h4>The Princess's Courtship</h4>

<p>
<!--
Et dum hortaretur iuvenem, subito introivit filia regis speciosa
atque auro fulgens, iam adulta virgo; dedit osculum patri, post
haec discumbentibus omnibus amicis. 
-->
 And while he was encouraging the youth, the beautiful daughter of
 the king suddenly entered, shining with gold, and already a
 grownup young woman.  She gave a kiss to her father, and then
 to all of his guests, sitting at dinner.

<!--
Quae dum oscularetur, pervenit ad naufragum.
-->
 During this exchange of kisses, she reached the shipwrecked man.

<!--
Retrorsum rediit ad patrem, et ait: "Bone rex et pater optime,
quis est nescio hic iuvenis qui contra te in honorato loco
discumbit et nescio quid flebili vultu dolet?"
-->
 She returned to her father, and said: "Good king and most kind
 father, who is this unknown youth who sits opposite you in the
 place of honor and who grieves with a doleful expression?"

<!--
Cui rex ait: "Hic iuvenis naufragus est et in gymnasio mihi
servitium gratissime fecit; propter quod ad cenam ilium invitavi.
Quis autem sit aut unde, nescio. Sed si vis, interroga ilium;
decet enim te, filia sapientissima, omnia nosse.  Et forsitan, dum
cognoveris, misereberis illi."
-->
 And the king said to her: "This shipwrecked youth did me most
 agreeable service in the gym.  On account of this I invited him
 to dinner. But who he might be, or from where, I do not know. But
 question him, if you can; for it is fitting for you, my wisest
 daughter, to learn everything.  And perhaps, as you inquire,
 you will have compassion for him."

<!--
Hortante igitur patre, verecundissimo sermone interrogatur a
puella Apollonius; et accedens ad eum ait: "Licet taciturnitas tua
sit tristior, generositas autem tuam nobilitatem ostendit.  Sed
si tibi molestum non est, indica mihi nomen et casus tuos."
-->
 And so, with her father's encouragement Apollonius was questioned
 by the girl with a most modest speech.  She went up to him and
 said: "It's okay for your silence to be rather gloomy, but your
 bearing shows your nobility.  But if it's no trouble, reveal to
 me your name and your fortunes."

<!--
Apollonius ait: "Si nomen quaeris, Apollonius sum vocatus; si de
thesauro quaeris, in mare perdidi." Puella ait: "Apertius indica
mihi, ut intellegam."
-->
 Apollonius said: "If you ask my name, I am called Apollonius; if
 you ask about my fortune, it was lost in the sea." The girl said:
 "Tell me more clearly, so that I might understand."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Apollonius vero universos casus suos exposuit et finito 
sermone lacrimas effundere coepit. 
-->
 So Apollonius related all his fortunes, and at the end of his
 speech he began to pour out tears.

<!--
Quem ut vidit rex flentem, respiciens filiam suam ait: "Nata
dulcis, peccasti, quod dum eius nomen et casus adulescentis
agnosceres, veteres ei renovasti dolores. Ergo, dulcis et
sapiens filia, ex quo agnovisti veritatem, iustum est ut ei
liberalitatem tuam quasi regina ostendas."
-->
 When the king saw these tears, he gazed at his daughter and said:
 "Sweet daughter, you have done wrong, because when you learned his
 name and fortunes, you revived his old sorrow.  Therefore,
 sweet and wise daughter, since you have learned the truth, it is
 just for you to show him your courtesy like a queen."

<!--
Puella vero respiciens Apollonium ait: "Iam noster es, iuvenis,
depone maerorem; et quia permittit indulgentia patris mei,
locupletabo te."
-->
 Now the girl, gazing upon Apollonius, said: "You are already
 ours, youth, lay aside your sorrow; and since the kindness of
 my father permits it, I will enrich you."

<!--
Apollonius vero cum gemitu egit gratias.
-->
 Now Apollonius thanked her with a sigh.

<!--
Rex vero videns tantam bonitatem filiae suae valde gavisus est et
ait ad eam: "Nata dulcis, me salvum habeas, iube tibi
adferri lyram et aufer iuveni lacrimas, et exhilara ad
convivium."
-->
 Now the king, seeing such great tenderness of his daughter
 rejoiced greatly and said to her: "Sweet daughter, if you wish
 me safe, order a lyre to be brought to you and bear away the
 tears of the youth, and brighten the dinner party."

<!--
Puella vero iussit sibi adferri lyram.  At ubi accepit, cum nimia
dulcedine vocis chordarum sonos, melos cum voce miscebat. Omnes
convivae coeperunt mirari dicentes: "Non potest esse melius,
non esse dulcius plus isto, quod audivimus."
-->
 Now the girl ordered a lyre to be brought to her.  And when
 she got it, she mingled, with such excessive sweetness of
 voice, the sounds of the strings and the tunes with her
 voice.  All the guests fell to marvelling, saying: "Nothing
 can be sweeter than this, which we have heard."

<!--
Inter quos solus tacebat Apollonius.  Ad quem rex ait: "Apolloni,
foedam rem facis. Omnes filiam meam in arte musica laudant, quare
tu solus tacendo vituperas?"
-->
 Among them only Apollonius was silent.  The king said to him:
 "Apollonius, you are doing a foul thing.  Everyone praises my
 daughter in the art of music, why do you alone silently find
 fault?" 

<!--
Apollonius ait: "Domine rex, si permittis, dicam quod
sentio: filia enim tua in artem musicam incidit, sed non
didicit. Denique iube mihi dari lyram et statim scies quod
ante nesciebas."
-->

 Apollonius said: "My lord king, if you will permit it, I will
 tell what I feel: for your daughter fell in with the art of
 music, but did not learn it.  Indeed, order a lyre to be given
 to me and you will know at once what you didn't know before."

<!--
Rex Archistrates dixit: "Apolloni, ut intellego, in omnibus es 
locuples."
-->

 King Archistrates said: "Apollonius, as I understand, you are
 richly provided in everything."

<!--
Et induit statum, et corona caput coronavit, et accipiens
lyram introivit triclinium. Et ita fecit ut discumbentes non
Apollonium sed Apollinem existimarent. Atque ita facto silentio
"arripuit plectrum animumque accommodat arti."
-->
 And he dressed the part, and put a crown on his head, and,
 taking the lyre, entered the dining room.  And so he made the
 diners esteem, not Apollo, but Apollonius.  And so, when he
 fell silent, "he seized the plectrum and suits the mind to the
 art." 

<!--
Miscetur vox cantu modulata chordis. Discumbentes una cum rege
in laude clamare coeperunt et dicere: "Non potest melius, non
potest dulcius."
-->
 His singing voice was mingled with the song of the strings.
 The diners, together with the king, began to cry out in praise
 and to say: "Nothing can be better, nothing can be sweeter."

<!--
Post haec deponens lyram ingreditur in comico habitu et
mirabili manu et saltu inauditas actiones expressit, post
haec induit tragicum; et nihilominus admirabiliter complacuit
ita ut omnes amici regis hoc se numquam audisse testarentur nec
vidisse.
-->
 After this, putting away the lyre, he put on a comical garment
 and with marvelous gestures and leaps portrayed unheard of
 deeds.  After this he dressed as a tragidian; and
 notwithstanding was admirably pleasing, so that all of the
 friends of the king bore witness that they had never heard nor
 seen the like.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Inter haec filia regis, ut vidit iuvenem omnium artium
studiorumque esse cumulatum, vulneris saevo capitur
igne. Incidit in amorem. 
-->

 During this the king's daughter, as she saw that the youth was
 filled with every art and study, was seized by the fierce fire
 of an amorous wound.  She fell in love.

<!--
Et finito convivio sic ait puella ad patrem suum: "Permiseras
mihi paulo ante ut, si quid voluissem, de tuo tamen,
Apollonio darem, rex et pater optime."
-->

 And so when the banquet was over the girl said to her father:
 "My king and most kind father, a little while ago you allowed
 me to grant anything of yours that I wished to Apollonius."

<!--
Cui dixit: "Et permisi et permitto et opto." 
-->

 And he said: "I did so, and do now, and do so desire."

<!--
Permisso sibi a patre quod ipsa ultro praestare volebat,
intuens Apollonium ait: "Apolloni magister, accipe indulgentia
patris mei ducenta talenta auri, argenti pondera XL, servos
xx et vestem copiosissimam."
-->

 Having been allowed by her father to furnish voluntarily what
 she herself wished, she said, looking at Apollonius, "Master
 Apollonius, accept by the kindness of my father two hundred
 talents of gold, forty pounds of silver, twenty servants and a
 rich robe."

<!--
Et intuens Apollonii famulos, quos donaverat, dixit: "Afferte
quaequae promisi et praesentibus omnibus exponite in
triclinio."
-->

 And looking at the attendants that she had given to
 Apollonius, she said: "Convey each thing that I have promised
 and set it all out at hand in the diningroom."

<!--
Laudant omnes liberalitatem puellae. Peractoque convivio
levaverunt se universi; vale* dicentes regi et reginae
discesserunt.
-->

Everyone praised the girl's generosity. And at the conclusion
of the banquet they all picked themselves up; and, saying
farewell to the king and the princess, they withdrew.  

<!--
Ipse quoque Apollonius ait: "Bone rex, miserorum misericors,
et tu, regina amatrix studiorum, valete."
-->

 Now Apollonius himself said: "Good king, merciful towards the
 unfortunate, and you, princess, a lover of learning, farewell."

<!--
Et haec dicens, respiciens famulos quos illi puella donaverat,
ait: "Tollite, famuli, hoc quod mihi regina donavit: aurum,
argentum et vestem; et eamus hospitalia quaerentes."
-->
 
 And saying this, and looking at the attendants that the girl
 had given to him, he said: "Take up, attendants, that which
 the princess has given me: the gold, the silver and the robe;
 and let us go and seek out an inn."

<!--
Puella vero timens ne amatum non videns torqueretur, respexit
patrem suum et ait: "Bone rex, pater optime, placet tibi ut
hodie Apollonius a nobis locupletatus abscedat, et quod illi
dedisti a malis hominibus ei rapiatur?"
-->

 The girl truly fearing lest she be tormented by not seeing her
 beloved, gazed at her father and said: "Good king, most kind 
 father, is it fitting for you that today Apollonius should
 depart from us enriched, and that which you have given him
 might be snatched away by evil men?"

<!--
Cui rex ait: "Bene dicis, domina; iube ergo ei dari unam
zaetam, ubi digne quiescat."
-->

 And the king said to her: "You speak well, lady; therefore
 command that he be given a room, where he might suitably sleep."

<!--
Accepta igitur mansione Apollonius bene acceptus requievit,
agens deo gratias, qui ei non denegavit regem consolatorem.
-->

 Therefore, having accepted a lodging, Apollonius took a
 welcome rest, giving thanks to the god who had not refused him
 a regal comforter.
