<h4>The Princess's Courtship</h4>

<p>
<!--
Et dum hortaretur iuvenem, subito introivit filia regis speciosa
atque auro fulgens, iam adulta virgo; dedit osculum patri, post
haec discumbentibus omnibus amicis. 
-->
 And while he was encouraging the youth, the beautiful daughter of
 the king suddenly entered, shining with gold, and already a
 grownup young woman.  She gave a kiss to her father, and then
 to all of his guests, sitting at dinner.

<!--
Quae dum oscularetur, pervenit ad naufragum.
-->
 During this exchange of kisses, she reached the shipwrecked man.

<!--
Retrorsum rediit ad patrem, et ait: "Bone rex et pater optime,
quis est nescio hic iuvenis qui contra te in honorato loco
discumbit et nescio quid flebili vultu dolet?"
-->
 She returned to her father, and said: "Good king and most kind
 father, who is this unknown youth who sits opposite you in the
 place of honor and who grieves with a doleful expression?"

<!--
Cui rex ait: "Hic iuvenis naufragus est et in gymnasio mihi
servitium gratissime fecit; propter quod ad cenam ilium invitavi.
Quis autem sit aut unde, nescio. Sed si vis, interroga ilium;
decet enim te, filia sapientissima, omnia nosse.  Et forsitan, dum
cognoveris, misereberis illi."
-->
 And the king said to her: "This shipwrecked youth did me most
 agreeable service in the gym.  On account of this I invited him
 to dinner. But who he might be, or from where, I do not know. But
 question him, if you can; for it is fitting for you, my wisest
 daughter, to learn everything.  And perhaps, as you inquire,
 you will have compassion for him."

<!--
Hortante igitur patre, verecundissimo sermone interrogatur a
puella Apollonius; et accedens ad eum ait: "Licet taciturnitas tua
sit tristior, generositas autem tuam nobilitatem ostendit.  Sed
si tibi molestum non est, indica mihi nomen et casus tuos."
-->
 And so, with her father's encouragement Apollonius was questioned
 by the girl with a most modest speech.  She went up to him and
 said: "It's okay for your silence to be rather gloomy, but your
 bearing shows your nobility.  But if it's no trouble, reveal to
 me your name and your fortunes."

<!--
Apollonius ait: "Si nomen quaeris, Apollonius sum vocatus; si de
thesauro quaeris, in mare perdidi." Puella ait: "Apertius indica
mihi, ut intellegam."
-->
 Apollonius said: "If you ask my name, I am called Apollonius; if
 you ask about my fortune, it was lost in the sea." The girl said:
 "Tell me more clearly, so that I might understand."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Apollonius vero universos casus suos exposuit et finito 
sermone lacrimas effundere coepit. 
-->
 So Apollonius related all his fortunes, and at the end of his
 speech he began to pour out tears.

<!--
Quem ut vidit rex flentem, respiciens filiam suam ait: "Nata
dulcis, peccasti, quod dum eius nomen et casus adulescentis
agnosceres, veteres ei renovasti dolores. Ergo, dulcis et
sapiens filia, ex quo agnovisti veritatem, iustum est ut ei
liberalitatem tuam quasi regina ostendas."
-->
 When the king saw these tears, he gazed at his daughter and said:
 "Sweet daughter, you have done wrong, because when you learned his
 name and fortunes, you revived his old sorrow.  Therefore,
 sweet and wise daughter, since you have learned the truth, it is
 just for you to show him your courtesy like a queen."

<!--
Puella vero respiciens Apollonium ait: "Iam noster es, iuvenis,
depone maerorem; et quia permittit indulgentia patris mei,
locupletabo te."
-->
 Now the girl, gazing upon Apollonius, said: "You are already
 ours, youth, lay aside your sorrow; and since the kindness of
 my father permits it, I will enrich you."

<!--
Apollonius vero cum gemitu egit gratias.
-->
 Now Apollonius thanked her with a sigh.

<!--
Rex vero videns tantam bonitatem filiae suae valde gavisus est et
ait ad eam: "Nata dulcis, me salvum habeas, iube tibi
adferri lyram et aufer iuveni lacrimas, et exhilara ad
convivium."
-->
 Now the king, seeing such great tenderness of his daughter
 rejoiced greatly and said to her: "Sweet daughter, if you wish
 me safe, order a lyre to be brought to you and bear away the
 tears of the youth, and brighten the dinner party."

<!--
Puella vero iussit sibi adferri lyram.  At ubi accepit, cum nimia
dulcedine vocis chordarum sonos, melos cum voce miscebat. Omnes
convivae coeperunt mirari dicentes: "Non potest esse melius,
non esse dulcius plus isto, quod audivimus."
-->
 Now the girl ordered a lyre to be brought to her.  And when
 she got it, she mingled, with such excessive sweetness of
 voice, the sounds of the strings and the tunes with her
 voice.  All the guests fell to marvelling, saying: "Nothing
 can be sweeter than this, which we have heard."

<!--
Inter quos solus tacebat Apollonius.  Ad quem rex ait: "Apolloni,
foedam rem facis. Omnes filiam meam in arte musica laudant, quare
tu solus tacendo vituperas?"
-->
 Among them only Apollonius was silent.  The king said to him:
 "Apollonius, you are doing a foul thing.  Everyone praises my
 daughter in the art of music, why do you alone silently find
 fault?" 

<!--
Apollonius ait: "Domine rex, si permittis, dicam quod
sentio: filia enim tua in artem musicam incidit, sed non
didicit. Denique iube mihi dari lyram et statim scies quod
ante nesciebas."
-->

 Apollonius said: "My lord king, if you will permit it, I will
 tell what I feel: for your daughter fell in with the art of
 music, but did not learn it.  Indeed, order a lyre to be given
 to me and you will know at once what you didn't know before."

<!--
Rex Archistrates dixit: "Apolloni, ut intellego, in omnibus es 
locuples."
-->

 King Archistrates said: "Apollonius, as I understand, you are
 richly provided in everything."

<!--
Et induit statum, et corona caput coronavit, et accipiens
lyram introivit triclinium. Et ita fecit ut discumbentes non
Apollonium sed Apollinem existimarent. Atque ita facto silentio
"arripuit plectrum animumque accommodat arti."
-->
 And he dressed the part, and put a crown on his head, and,
 taking the lyre, entered the dining room.  And so he made the
 diners esteem, not Apollo, but Apollonius.  And so, when he
 fell silent, "he seized the plectrum and suits the mind to the
 art." 

<!--
Miscetur vox cantu modulata chordis. Discumbentes una cum rege
in laude clamare coeperunt et dicere: "Non potest melius, non
potest dulcius."
-->
 His singing voice was mingled with the song of the strings.
 The diners, together with the king, began to cry out in praise
 and to say: "Nothing can be better, nothing can be sweeter."

<!--
Post haec deponens lyram ingreditur in comico habitu et
mirabili manu et saltu inauditas actiones expressit, post
haec induit tragicum; et nihilominus admirabiliter complacuit
ita ut omnes amici regis hoc se numquam audisse testarentur nec
vidisse.
-->
 After this, putting away the lyre, he put on a comical garment
 and with marvelous gestures and leaps portrayed unheard of
 deeds.  After this he dressed as a tragidian; and
 notwithstanding was admirably pleasing, so that all of the
 friends of the king bore witness that they had never heard nor
 seen the like.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Inter haec filia regis, ut vidit iuvenem omnium artium
studiorumque esse cumulatum, vulneris saevo capitur
igne. Incidit in amorem. 
-->

 During this the king's daughter, as she saw that the youth was
 filled with every art and study, was seized by the fierce fire
 of an amorous wound.  She fell in love.

<!--
Et finito convivio sic ait puella ad patrem suum: "Permiseras
mihi paulo ante ut, si quid voluissem, de tuo tamen,
Apollonio darem, rex et pater optime."
-->

 And so when the banquet was over the girl said to her father:
 "My king and most kind father, a little while ago you allowed
 me to grant anything of yours that I wished to Apollonius."

<!--
Cui dixit: "Et permisi et permitto et opto." 
-->

 And he said: "I did so, and do now, and do so desire."

<!--
Permisso sibi a patre quod ipsa ultro praestare volebat,
intuens Apollonium ait: "Apolloni magister, accipe indulgentia
patris mei ducenta talenta auri, argenti pondera XL, servos
xx et vestem copiosissimam."
-->

 Having been allowed by her father to furnish voluntarily what
 she herself wished, she said, looking at Apollonius, "Master
 Apollonius, accept by the kindness of my father two hundred
 talents of gold, forty pounds of silver, twenty servants and a
 rich robe."

<!--
Et intuens Apollonii famulos, quos donaverat, dixit: "Afferte
quaequae promisi et praesentibus omnibus exponite in
triclinio."
-->

 And looking at the attendants that she had given to
 Apollonius, she said: "Convey each thing that I have promised
 and set it all out at hand in the diningroom."

<!--
Laudant omnes liberalitatem puellae. Peractoque convivio
levaverunt se universi; vale* dicentes regi et reginae
discesserunt.
-->

Everyone praised the girl's generosity. And at the conclusion
of the banquet they all picked themselves up; and, saying
farewell to the king and the princess, they withdrew.  

<!--
Ipse quoque Apollonius ait: "Bone rex, miserorum misericors,
et tu, regina amatrix studiorum, valete."
-->

 Now Apollonius himself said: "Good king, merciful towards the
 unfortunate, and you, princess, a lover of learning, farewell."

<!--
Et haec dicens, respiciens famulos quos illi puella donaverat,
ait: "Tollite, famuli, hoc quod mihi regina donavit: aurum,
argentum et vestem; et eamus hospitalia quaerentes."
-->
 
 And saying this, and looking at the attendants that the girl
 had given to him, he said: "Take up, attendants, that which
 the princess has given me: the gold, the silver and the robe;
 and let us go and seek out an inn."

<!--
Puella vero timens ne amatum non videns torqueretur, respexit
patrem suum et ait: "Bone rex, pater optime, placet tibi ut
hodie Apollonius a nobis locupletatus abscedat, et quod illi
dedisti a malis hominibus ei rapiatur?"
-->

 The girl truly fearing lest she be tormented by not seeing her
 beloved, gazed at her father and said: "Good king, most kind 
 father, is it fitting for you that today Apollonius should
 depart from us enriched, and that which you have given him
 might be snatched away by evil men?"

<!--
Cui rex ait: "Bene dicis, domina; iube ergo ei dari unam
zaetam, ubi digne quiescat."
-->

 And the king said to her: "You speak well, lady; therefore
 command that he be given a room, where he might suitably sleep."

<!--
Accepta igitur mansione Apollonius bene acceptus requievit,
agens deo gratias, qui ei non denegavit regem consolatorem.
-->

 Therefore, having accepted a lodging, Apollonius took a
 welcome rest, giving thanks to the god who had not refused him
 a regal comforter.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Sed "regina" sui "iam dudum saucia cura" Apolloni "figit in
pectore vultus verbaque" cantusque memor "credit genus esse
deorum." Nec somnum oculis "nec membris dat cura quietem."
-->

 But the "queen, by now wounded with care" for her Apollonius
 "pins her face and her words on her breast" and his remembered
 song "confides his rank to be of the gods." "Her care grants"
 neither sleep to eyes "nor rest to limbs."

<!--
Vigilans primo mane irrumpit cubiculum patris. Pater
videns filiam ait: "Filia dulcis, quid est quod tam mane
praeter consuetudinem vigilasti?"
-->

 Waking at first light, she bursts into her father's
 bedchamber. Her father, on seeing his daughter, says: "Sweet
 daughter, why is it that you have risen so early, contrary to
 your habit?"

<!--
Puella ait: "Hesterna studia me excitaverunt. Peto itaque,
pater, ut me tradas hospiti nostro Apollonio studiorum
percipiendorum gratia."
-->

 The girl said: "Yesterday's pursuits aroused me.  And so I
 ask, father, that you deliver me to our guest Apollonius for
 the sake of taking lessons."

<!--
Rex vero gaudio plenus iussit ad se iuvenem vocari.  Cui sic
ait: "Apolloni, studiorum tuorum felicitatem filia mea a te
discere concupivit. Peto itaque ut desiderio natae meae
parueris, et iuro tibi per regni mei vires: quicquid tibi
iratum abstulit mare, ego in terris restituam."
-->

 The king, truly filled with joy, ordered the young man to be
 called in.  And spoke thus to him: "Apollonius, my daughter
 has desired to learn the happiness of your studies from you.
 And so I ask that you obey my daughter's desire, and I swear
 to you by the power of my kingdom:  whatever of yours did the
 angry sea sweep away, I will restore on land."

<!--
Apollonius, hoc audito, docet puellam, sicuti et ipse
didicerat. Interposito brevi temporis spatio, cum non posset
puella ulla ratione vulnus amoris tolerare, simulata
infirmitate membra prostravit fluxa, et coepit iacere
imbecillis in toro. Rex ut vidit filiam suam subitaneam
valetudinem incurrisse, sollicitus adhibet medicos, qui,
temptantes venas, tangunt singulas corporis partes, nec omnino
inveniunt aegritudinis causas.
-->

 Apollonius, on hearing this, teaches the girl, just as he
 himself had learned.  After a brief spell, since the girl
 could not in any way bear the wound of love, a flux laid low
 her limbs with a feigned illness, and she took to lying feebly
 on her couch.  The king, as he sees that his daughter had met
 with a sudden illness, was concerned and summons the doctors,
 who, trying her veins, touch every part of her body, but do
 not find the cause of the disease.
</p>


<p>
<!--
Rex autem post paucos dies, tenens Apollonium manu, forum
petit et cum eo deambulavit. Iuvenes scholastici tres
nobilissimi, qui per longum tempus filiam eius petebant in
matrimonium, pariter omnes una voce salutaverunt eum. Quos
videns rex subridens ait illis: "Quid est hoc quod una voce me
pariter salutastis?"
-->

 But the king, after a few days, holding Apollonius by the
 hand, makes for the courtyard and walks abroad with him.
 Three young and truly noble youths, who had long asked for
 the daughter in marriage, greeted him together with a single
 voice.  On seeing them the king, laughing, said to them: "Why
 do you greet me with a single voice?"

<!--
Unus ex ipsis ait: "Petentibus nobis filiam vestram in
matrimonium tu saepius nos differendo fatigas; propter quod
hodie una simul venimus. Elige ex nobis quem vis habere
generum."
-->

 One of them said: "When we seek your daughter in marriage you
 often importune us to delay; on account of which today we
 came at one and the same time. Pick which of us you wish for
 a son-in-law."

<!--
Rex ait: "Non apto tempore me interpellastis; filia enim mea
studiis vacat et prae amore studiorum imbecillis iacet. Sed ne
videar vos diutius differre, scribite in codicillos nomina
vestra et dotis quantitatem; et dirigo ipsos codicillos
filiae meae, et illa sibi eligat quem voluerit habere
maritum."
-->

 The king said: "You have disturbed me an unsuitable time; for
 my daughter has left her studies idle and from the love of
 her studies lies enfeebled.  But lest I seem to put you off
 for a long time, write in notes your names and the amount of
 your dowry; and I will direct these notes to my daughter, so
 that she might choose for herself whom she wishes to marry."

<!--
Illi tres itaque iuvenes scripserunt nomina sua et dotis
quantitatem. Rex accepit codicillos anuloque suo signavit
datque Apollonio dicens: "Tolle, magister, praeter tui
contumeliam hos codicillos et perfer discipulae tuae; hic
enim locus te desiderat."
-->

 And so the three young men wrote down their names and the
 amount of their doweries.  The king took the notes and
 sealed them with his ring and gives them to Apollonius,
 saying: "Take, master, with no offense, these notes and
 carry them to your pupil; for this position requires you."

</p>


<p>
<!--
Apollonius acceptis codicillis pergit domum regiam et
introivit cubiculum tradiditque codicillos. Puella patris
agnovit signaculum. Quae ad amores suos sic ait: "Quid
est, magister, quod sic singularis cubiculum introisti?"
-->

 Apollonius, having taken the notes, proceeds to the princess
 at home and entered her bedchamber and gave her the notes.
 The girl recognized her father's seal.  And spoke to her
 beloved thus: "Why is it, master, that you have so entered
 my bedchamber alone."

<!--
Cui Apollonius respondit: "Domina, es non dum mulier et male
habes. Sed potius accipe codicillos patris tui et lege
trium nomina petitorum."
-->

 And Apollonius replies to her: "Lady, you are not yet a woman
 and you are ill. But take, rather, the notes of your father
 and read the names of the three candidates."

<!--
Puella vero reserato codicillo legit, perlectoque nomen
ibidem non legit quem volebat et amabat.  Et respiciens
Apollonium ait: "Magister Apolloni, ita tibi non dolet quod
ego nubam?"
-->

 Indeed the girl unsealed the notes and read through them, and
 saw in an instant that she had not read the name that she
 wanted and loved.  And, gazing at Apollonius, she said:
 "Master Apollonius, so it pains thee not that I am to marry?" 

<!--
Apollonius dixit: "Immo gratulor quod abundantia horum
studiorum docta et a me patefacta deo volente et cui animus
tuus desiderat, nubas."
-->

 Apollonius said: "No indeed, I rejoice that by the fullness
 of the studies that were taught and revealed by me and by the
 will of god that you will marry who your soul desires."

<!--
Cui puella ait: "Magister, si amares, utique doleres tuam
doctrinam."
-->

 And the girl said to him: "Master, if you had loved me, then
 you would certainly regret your teaching."

<!--
Et scripsit codicillos et signatos suo anulo iuveni
tradidit. Pertulit Apollonius in forum tradiditque
regi. Accepto codicillo rex resignavit et aperuit ilium. In
quibus rescripserat filia sua: "Bone rex et pater optime,
quoniam clementiae tuae indulgentia permittis mihi, dicam:
illum volo coniugem, naufragio patrimonio deceptum. Et si
miraris, pater, quod tam pudica virgo tam impudenter
scripserim: per ceram mandavi, quae pudorem non habet."
-->

 And she wrote a note and sealed it with her ring and
 delivered it to the young men.  Apollonius carried it
 through to the courtyard and delivered it to the king.
 Having taken the note the king unsealed it and opened it.
 Inside his daughter had written in reply: "Good king and most
 kind father, seeing that you entrust to me by the kindness of
 your mercy, I will say: I wish for a spouse the man cheated
 of his inheritance by shipwreck.  And if you marvel, father,
 that such a modest maiden might write so shamelessly; I have
 committed to a letter, which he holds no shame."

</p>


<p>
<!--
Et perlectis codicillis rex ignorans quem naufragum diceret,
respiciens ilios tres iuvenes qui nomina sua scripserant
vel* qui dotem in illis codicillis designaverant, ait illis:
"Quis vestrum naufragium fecit?"
-->

 And, having read through the note, the king, not knowing who
 she called shipwrecked, looking at the three young men who
 had written down their names and who had described their
 doweries in those notes, said to them: "Which of you has been
 shipwrecked?" 

<!--
Unus vero ex iis, Ardalion nomine, dixit: "Ego." 
-->

 In fact one of them, Ardalion by name, said: "I have."

<!--
Alius ait: "Tace, morbus te consumat nec salvus sis, cum scio
te coaetaneum meum et mecum litteris eruditum, et portam
civitatis numquam existi; ubi ergo naufragium fecisti?"
-->

 Another said: "Be still, may sickness devour you and may you
 lack salvation, since I have known you from childhood, and
 know that you never went outside the gates of the city; when,
 therefore, were you shipwrecked?"

<!--
Et cum rex non inveniret quis eorum naufragium fecisset,
respiciens Apollonium ait: "Tolle, magister Apolloni, hos
codicillos et lege. Potest enim fieri ut, quod ego non inveni,
tu intellegas, quia praesens fuisti."
-->

 And since the king did learn which of them had been
 shipwrecked, looking at Apollonius he said: "Take, master
 Apollonius, this note and read it.  For it can happen that,
 althought I did not manage it, you might understand it, for
 you were present."

<!--
Apollonius accepto codicillo legit et, ut sensit se a regina
amari, erubuit. Et rex tenens ei manum paululum secessit ab
eis iuvenibus et ait: "Quid est, magister Apolloni, invenisti
naufragum?"
-->

 Apollonius, having taken the note, read it and, as he
 perceived that he himself was loved by the princess,
 blushed.  And the king, holding his hand to him, withdrew a
 little from the young men and said: "What is it, master
 Apollonius?  Have you discovered the shipwrecked one?"

<!--
Apollonius ait: "Bone rex, si permittis, inveni."
-->

 Apollonius said: "Good king, if you will allow it, I have
 discovered him."

</p>

<p>
<!--
Et his dictis videns rex faciem eius roseo colore perfusam,
intellexit dictum et ait gaudens: "Quod filia mea cupit, hoc
est et meum votum; nihil enim in huiusmodi negotio sine deo
agi potest." 
-->

 And when he had said these words the king, seeing his face
 bathed in read, understood what had been written and said,
 rejoicing: "What my daughter desires, this is my pledge; for
 nothing in such an affair can take place without god."

<!--
Et respiciens illos tres iuvenes ait: "Certe dixi vobis quia
non apto tempore interpellastis. Ite, et dum tempus fuerit
mittam ad vos." Et dimisit eos a se.
-->

 And, looking at the three young men, he said: "Indeed I spoke
 to you because you interrupted at an unsuitable time.  Go,
 and after time passes I will send to you."  And he sent them
 away. 

</p>

<p>
<!--
Et tenens manum iam genero, non hospiti, ingreditur domum
regiam. Ipso autem Apollonio relicto rex solus intrat ad
filiam suam dicens: "Dulcis nata, quem tibi elegisti
coniugem?"
-->

 And holding the hand of the one who was no longer his guest,
 but now his son-in-law, he enters the princess' house.  Then,
 leaving Apollonius himself, he goes in to his daughter,
 saying: "Sweet daughter, whom have you chosen to marry?"

<!--
Puella vero prostravit se ad pedes patris sui et ait: "Pater
carissime, quia cupis audire natae tuae desiderium: illum
volo coniugem et amo, patrimonio deceptum et naufragum,
magistrum meum Apollonium; cui si non me tradideris, a
praesenti perdes filiam."
-->

 Indeed, the girl threw herself down at her father's feet and
 said: "Dearest father, since you desire to hear your
 daughter's pleasure: I want and love that spouse, who was
 cheated of his inheritance and shipwrecked, my master
 Apollonius; if you do not deliver me to him, you will
 immediately destroy your daughter."

<!--
Et cum rex filiae non posset ferre lacrimas erexit eam et
adloquitur dicens: "Nata dulcis, noli de aliqua re cogitare,
quia talem concupisti quem ego, ex quo eum vidi, tibi
coniungere optavi. Sed ego tibi vere consentio, quia et ego
amando factus sum pater."
-->

 And since the king couldn't bear her tears he raised her up
 and addressed her, saying: "Sweet daughter, think nothing of
 it, for I ardently desired such a thing, from the time that I
 saw him, I wished for him to marry you.  And I am in
 complete agreement with you, for I became your beloved's
 father. 

<!--
Et exiens foras respiciens Apollonium ait: "Magister Apolloni,
quia scrutavi filiam meam quid ei in animo resideret
nuptiarum causa, lacrimis fusis multa inter alia mihi
narravit dicens et adiurans me ait: "'Iuraveras magistro meo
Apollonio, ut si desideriis meis in doctrinis paruisset, dares
illi quicquid iratum abstulit mare. Modo vero, quia paruit
tuis praeceptis et, obsequiis ab ipso tibi factis et meae
voluntati in doctrinis, aurum, argentum, vestes, mancipia aut
possessiones non quaerit, nisi solum regnum quod putaverat
perdidisse, tuo sacramento per meam iussionem me ei
tradas.' Unde, magister Apolloni, peto ne nuptias filiae meae
fastidio 50 habeas." 60
-->

 And, going out into the courtyard and looking at Apollonius,
 he said: "Master Apollonius, since I have probed my daughter
 for what lies in her heart concerning her marriage, through a
 flood of tears amoung many other things she recounted to me,
 saying and swearing to me, she said: 'You have sworn to my
 master Apollonius, that if he had obeyed my desires in
 learning, you would give him whatever the angry sea had
 snatched away.  Therefore, since he has obeyed your commands
 and, having himself performed services for you and to my
 purpose in teaching, he seeks not gold, silver, clothing, slaves or
 possessions, excepting only the kingdom that he had belived
 to have lost, by your oath and by my command you will hand me
 over to him.'  From which, master Apollonius, I ask that you
 scorn not to marry my daughter."

<!--
Apollonius ait: "Quod a deo est, sit, et si tua est voluntas,
impleatur." 
-->

 Apollonius said: "What is from god, let it be so, and if you
 will it, I am satisfied."
