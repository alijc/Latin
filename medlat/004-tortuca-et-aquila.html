<!--IV DE TORTUCA ET AQUILA-->
<h4>The Tortoise and the Eagle</h4>

<p>
<!--
Tortuca, manens in locis humidis et imis, rogavit aquilam
quod portaret eam in altum. Desiderat enim videre montes
et colles et nemora. Aquila acquievit et tortucam in altum
portavit, dixitque ei: "Vides iam quae numquam vidisti."
Dixit tortuca: "Bene video; mallem tamen esse in foramine 
meo." Aquila vero dimisit eam cadere et cadens fracta
est.
-->
 A tortoise, abiding in damp and deep places, asked an eagle
 to carry him on high.  For he wanted to see mountains and
 valleys and woods.  The eagle acquiesced and carried the
 tortoise up high, and said to him:  "You are seeing what you
 never before saw."  The tortoise said: "I see well; but I
 would prefer to be in my own hole."  And so the eagle let him
 drop, and he was shattered in the fall.

Mistice. Ita contigit aliquando quod aliquis, vivens in
paupere tecto, desiderat ascendere super pennas ventorum et
volare. Rogat aquilam, id est diabolum, quod aliquo modo eum
exaltet. Assumit munera et dat ea ut promoveatur, et sic per
simoniam ascendit ad dignitatis altitudinem; et sic diabolus
portat ipsum; sed quandoque, talis in se reversus, intellegit
statum suum periculosum; mallet esse in paupere tecto quam in
dignitatis periculo. Sed diabolus, aliquando vitae suae
terminum anticipans, subita morte eum perimit, et sic eum in
puteum inferni ruit, ubi totus confringitur. Unde dicitur: 
  Sic est cum stultus scandit pernicibus alis:
  Incidit a scalis in loca plena malis.
-->
  The interpretation.  It sometimes happens that someone,
  living in a poor house, wishes to rise unto the wings of the
  winds and fly.  He asks the eagle, that is, the devil, to
  elevate him in some way.  He gives and receives bribes
  to be promoted, and so through simony rises to a high
  position; and thus the devil carries him; but whenever,
  having looked back, he realizes his own peril he would
  rather be in his poor house than in the peril of office.
  But the devil, anticipating the end of his life at some
  time, destroys him with a sudden death, and so hurls him
  into the well of Hell, where all is shattered.  From which
  it is said:
</p>
<blockquote>
   So it is with a fool who climbs on agile wings:<br>
   He falls from a ladder into a place filled with evils.
