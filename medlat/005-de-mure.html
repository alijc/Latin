<!--V DE MURE DOMESTICA ET CAMPESTRI-->
<h4>The House Mouse and the Field Mouse</h4>

<!--
Quaedam mus domestica quaerebat a campestri quid
comederet vel quo sustentaretur. Quae respondit: "Duras
fabas, sicca grana frumenti vel hordei comedo."
-->
 A certain house mouse was asking a field mouse what he
 would eat or how he would be sustained.  And he
 replied: "I eat hard beans, dried grain or barley."

<!--
Et ait mus domestica:
"Arida sunt cibaria tua. Mirum est quod fame non peris."
-->
 And the house mouse said: "Your rations are parched.
 It's a wonder that you don't perish of hunger."

<!--
Quaesivit etiam silvestris quid comederet mus domestica;
quae respondit: "Certe comedo pingues morcellos et album
panem; sed venias ad prandium meum et optime comedes."
-->
 And now he of the woods asked what the house mouse
 would eat; and he replied: "For sure I eat fat morsels
 and white bread; but you should join me for lunch and
 you will eat very well."

<!--
Placuit muri campestri et venit ad domum alterius muris.
Sedebant autem homines in domo ad prandium, qui micas et
morcellos de mensa proiecerunt. Mus domestica dixit
silvestri: "Exeas de foramine; ecce quot bona
proiciuntur."
-->
 This pleased the field mouse and he came to the other
 mouse's home.  Now the people in the house were sitting
 down to lunch, and they dropped crumbs and morsels from
 the table.  The house mouse said to the wood mouse:
 "Come out of the hole; look at how many good things
 they are dropping."
 
<!--
Exivitque campestris et, uno morcello accepto, saltavit
catus post murem et fere eam cepit; sed ipsa sic
territa vix evasit et in foramine existens dixit muri
domesticae: "Habes singulis diebus talem socium,
scilicet murilegum, qui te cotidie nititur devorare?"
-->
 And the field mouse came out and, after he got one
 morsel, a cat sprang after the mouse and nearly caught
 him; but in his terror he only just escaped, and once
 more in the hole said to the house mouse: "Do you have
 such an associate every day, a mouse-killer of course,
 who strives to devour you daily?"

<!--
Quae respondit: "Utique habeo, quoniam patrem meum et
matrem meam interfecit." 
-->
 And he replied: "I certainly do, for he killed my
 father and my mother."

<!--
Et ait campestris: "Ecce nollem habere totum mundum cum
tali periculo."
-->
 And the field mouse said: "Look, I wouldn't want to possess
 the whole world with such peril."

<!--
Unde quidam ex parte muris campestris:

Rodere malo fabam quam cura perpete rodi.
Tutius est certe modico gaudere salubri,
Quam magnis tristi condicione frui.
-->
 Whence one of the field mouse faction said:
<blockquote>
 It's better to gnaw on an awful bean than to be gnawed by perpetual care.
 It is surely safer to be glad of a wholesome little,
 Than to enjoy a great and gloomy situation.
