<!--VI De Vulpe, Qui Dicitur Reynardus, Obviante Teberto Murilego-->
<h4>The Fox, Who is called Reynard, on Meeting with the Mouser Tebertus</h4>

<p>
<!--
Vulpes, qui et Reynardus dicitur, obviavit semel Teberto, id
est murilego, cui dixit Reynardus: "Dic mihi, quot fraudes
vel artificia nosti?"  Qui respondit se unum artificium
tantummodo scire. Cui vulpes: "Quod est illud?" Respondit
murilegus: "Quando canes me sequuntur scio super arborem
ascendere et sic evadere."  Tunc catus quaesivit a vulpe,
dicens: "Quot fraudes noscis et tu?" Qui respondit: "Scio
autem XVIII, et adhuc habeo sacculum plenum. Propterea veni
mecum et docebo te artificia mea; quibus agnitis morsus canum
semper evades."

 A fox, who is also called Reynard, once met with Tebertus,
 that is, a mouser, to whom Reynard said: "Tell me, how many
 frauds or tricks do you know of?"  And he replied that that
 he knew only one trick.  And the fox said: "What is that?"
 The mouser replied: "When the dogs are after me I know to
 climb up into a tree and so get away."  Then the cat
 questioned the fox, saying: "How many frauds do you yourself
 know?"  And he replied: "Now I know 18, and thus far I have
 a full purse.  Therefore, come with me and I will teach you
 my tricks.  And once you have learned them you will always
 be able to escape the jaws of the dogs."

<!-- 
Euntibus autem illis simul, ecce venatores et canes
insequebantur eos a tergo, et ait catus: "Audio canes et iam
timor invasit me."  Cui vulpes: " Ne timeas." Et
appropinquantibus canibus, dixit catus: "Certe amplius non
sequar te; volo enim uti artificio meo," et ascendens arborem
evasit, et, ipso dimisso, canes vulpem insecuti sunt et
tandem eum ceperunt. Catus vero, in alto sedens et eventum
rei considerans, clamavit, dicens: "Reynarde, Reynarde, aperi
sacculum tuum, quia iam tempus est. Certe omnes fraudes tuae
non tibi proficiunt."

 But as they were walking together, lo, hunters and dogs
 attacked them from behind, and the cat said:  "I hear dogs
 and fear already overwhelms me."  And the fox said to him:
 "Don't be afraid."  And as the dogs approached, the cat
 said: "Surely I shouldn't follow you any further; for I'd
 like to use my own trick," and, climbing a tree, he got
 away, and, having given that one up, the dogs went after the
 fox and caught him in the end.  Indeed the cat, sitting up
 high and considering the outcome of the matter, cried out,
 saying: "Reynard, Reynard, open your purse, for it's now
 time. Surely all your frauds are not profiting you."

Mistice. Per catum intellegendi sunt simplices, qui unicum
artificium tantum sciunt, scilicet per contemplationem Domini
invocare et super arborem crucis Christi per fiduciam
ascendere et sic a canibus, id est, ab humani generis
inimicis, liberantur. Per Reynardum vero designantur
advocati, causidici fraudulenti, qui XVIII fraudes obtinent,
insuper et sacculum plenum. Tandem veniunt venatores
infernales et cum canibus suis ipsos insequuntur, rapiunt et
lacerant. Dicat ergo iustus ad tales: "Aperite sacculum
vestrum," etc.

 The moral.  Simple things ought to be understood by means of
 the cat, that they know only one trick, one may know to call
 upon the Lord through contemplation and to climb, through
 faith, the tree of the cross of Christ and so be freed from
 the dog, that is, from a harmful sort of man.  Indeed, by
 means of the fox, supporters are designated, deceitful
 advocates, who hold fast to 18 frauds, in addition to a
 full purse.  In the end the hunters of Hell come and pursue
 them with their dogs, and seize them and mangle them.
 Therefore, let the just man say to such men: "Open your
 purses," etc.
