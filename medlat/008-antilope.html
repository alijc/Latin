<!--VIII De Antilope-->
<h4>The Antelope</h4>

<p>
<!--
Quoddam animal est quod vocatur antilope; quod cum virgultis
ludit cum cornibus, tandem cornua eius implicantur cum
virgultis quod non potest ea extrahere et tunc incipit
clamare; quo audito veniunt venatores et interficiunt eum.
-->
 There is a certain animal that is called an antelope; because
 when it plays with brushwood with its horns, in the end its
 horns are so tangled with the brushwood that it can't
 pull them out.  And then it begins to cry out.  And when the
 hunters hear this they come and kill it.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Mistice. Sic contigit quod plerique delectati sunt et ludunt
cum negotiis huius mundi et sic in eisdem implicantur quod
evelli non possunt et sic a venatoribus, id est a
daemonibus, capiuntur et interficiuntur.
-->
 Moral.  It so happened that a good many were delighted and
 play with the troubles of this world and are so tangled
 with them that they can not be pulled out.  And so are
 seized and killed by the hunters, that is, by demons.
