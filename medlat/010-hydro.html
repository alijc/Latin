<h4>The Water-Snake</h4>

<p>
<!--
Quoddam animal dicitur hydrus, cuius natura est se involvere
luto, ut melius posset labi. Tandem in os crocodili, quando
dormit, intrat et sic, ventrem eius ingrediens, cor eius mordet
et sic crocodilum interimit.
-->
 A certain animal is called the water-snake, whose nature is to
 cover itself in clay, to be able to glide better.  In the end
 it enters into a sleeping crocodile's mouth and, advancing
 into its stomach, bites its heart and so does away with the
 crocodile. 
</p>

<p>
<!--
Mistice. Hydrus significat filium Dei, qui assumpsit lutum
nostrae carnis ut facilius laberetur in os diaboli, et sic, ventrem
eius ingrediens et cor eius mordens, ipsum interficit.
-->
 Moral.  The water-snake signifies the son of God, who assumed
 the clay of our flesh in order to more easily be slipped into
 the mouth of the devil, and so, entering into his stomach and
 biting his heart, kills him.
