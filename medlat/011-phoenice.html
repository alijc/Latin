<!--XI De Phoenice-->
<h4>The Phoenix</h4>

<p>
<!--
Est volatile quod dicitur phoenix, cuius figuram gerit
Dominus noster Iesus Christus qui dicit in evangelio suo:
"Potestatem habeo ponendi animam meam et potestatem habeo
iterum sumendi eam. Nemo eam tollet a me."
Propter haec enim verba irati sunt Iudaei. 
-->
 There is a bird that is called the phoenix, whose image is
 born by our Lord Jesus Christ, who said in his gospel: "I have
 the power to put my life down and I have the power to take
 it up again.  No one takes it away from me."
 Now the Jews were angered on account of these words.  

<!--
Est itaque haec avis
in Indiae partibus. De ea dicit physiologus quia expletis
quingentis annis vitae suae intrat in lignum Libani repletque
ambas alas suas diversis aromatibus eiusdem ligni faciensque
variis de pigmentis clausum nidum, congregat sarmentorum
acervum maximum subter domum ponens. 
-->
 And so there is this bird in the region of India.  The
 naturalist says this about it: when it has completed 500 years
 of its life it enters the forest of Lebanon and fills both of
 its wings with varied spices of the cedar wood and, making an
 enclosed nest out of the different spices, gathers a great
 heap of twigs and puts it down under its home.

<!--
Accedensque ad aerem solis ignem trahit secum et incendit
sarmenta ac ingreditur in nidum suum mense Faminoth, id est
Martio, et comburit se ipsam. Et cinis prima die vertitur in
vermem, secunda die in volucrem, tertia vero die revocatur in
pristinum statum. Haec avis significat Christum utrisque alis
odore suavissimo repletis, id est, veteris et novi testamenti.
-->
 And it picks fire up from the ground and carries it up into
 the sky and kindles the twigs, and enters its nest in the
 month of Faminoth, that is, March, and burns itself up. And on
 the first day the ashes are turned into maggots, on the second
 into flies, and indeed on the third day are revived into its
 original condition.  This bird signifies Christ, filled with a
 most pleasant odor from whichever of the two wings, that is, the
 old and new testaments.
