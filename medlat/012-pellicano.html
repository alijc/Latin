<!--XII De Pellicano-->
<h4>The Pelican</h4>

<p>
<!--
De pellicano dicit David in psalmo ci: "Similis factus sum
pellicano in solitudine." Physiologus dicit de eo quod nimis
amans sit filios suos. Cum autem genuerit natos et
coeperint crescere, percutientes lacerant parentes suos in
faciem.  Illi autem repercutiendo occidunt filios
suos. Tertia autem die mater eorum percutiens costam suam
aperit latus suum et infundit sanguinem super corpora
mortuorum, sicque cruore ipsius sanantur resuscitati
pulli. Ita et Dominus noster Iesus Christus per Isaiam
prophetam dicit: "Filios genui et exaltavi; ipsi autem me
spreverunt." Nos igitur auctor et conditor noster
omnipotens Deus creavit et cum non essemus fecit nos ut
essemus. Nos vero e contrario percussimus eum cum in
conspectu eius potius creaturae servivimus quam creatori.
Idcirco in crucem ascendere dignatus est percussoque latere
eius exivit sanguis et aqua in salutem nostram, et vitam
aeternam. Amen.

 David tells about the pelican in psalm 101: "I have become
 like a pelican in the wilderness."  The naturalist says
 about it that it has great love for its own offspring.  Now
 when it gives birth to young and they begin to grow, they
 strike their parents and cut them in the face. But the
 parents strike back, killing their children.  On the third
 day their mother strikes her side and opens her flank and
 pours her blood onto the dead bodies, and so the chicks are
 healed and revived by the flow of blood.  And so our Lord
 Jesus Christ says, by way of the prophet Isaiah: "I brought
 forth sons and I exalted; but they have spurned me."
 Therefore our founder and creater the almighty God made us
 and when we did not exist he made us to exist.  Indeed, we
 struck him because of the adversary when in his sight we put
 the created before the creator.  On that account he saw fit
 to ascend onto the cross was pierced in the side and
 discharged blood and water for our salvation and eternal
 life.  Amen.
