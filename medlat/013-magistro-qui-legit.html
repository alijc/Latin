<!--XIII De Magistro Qui Legit in Aere et in Aqua-->
<h4>The Teacher Who Lectured in Air and in Water</h4>

<p>
<!--
Audivi quod rex Franciae valde commotus fuerat et iratus
contra praecipuum magistrum Petrum Baalardum, qui Parisius
legebat, et prohibuit ei ne de cetero legeret in terra sua.
-->
 I have heard that the king of France had been greatly disturbed
 and had flown into a rage against a particular teacher, Peter
 Abelard, who was lecturing in Paris, and banned him from
 lecturing any further in his land.

<!--
Ipse vero ascendit super arborem praeminentem prope
civitatem Parisiensem, et omnes scholares Parisienses secuti
sunt eum audientes sub arbore magistri sui lectiones. Cum
autem rex quadam die de palatio suo videret multitudinem
scholarium sub arbore residentium, quaesivit quid hoc esset,
et dictum est ei quod clerici erant, qui magistrum Petrum
audiebant.
-->
 Indeed he climbed a pominent tree close by the city of Paris,
 and all the scholars of Paris followed him to hear the
 master's lectures under the tree.  But one day when the king, in
 his palace, saw a mob of scholars sitting under the tree, he
 asked what it was and was told that they were the students
 who were listening to Master Peter.

<!--
Ille vero valde iratus fecit magistrum ad se venire et dixit
ei: "Quomodo ita audax fuisti quod contra prohibitionem meam
in terra mea legisti?"
-->
 Indeed he was violently angry and ordered the teacher to come
 to him, and said to him:  "How were you so bold that you
 lectured in my land, contrary to my prohibition?"

<!--
Cui ille: "Domine, non legi post prohibitionem
vestram in terra vestra, verum tamen legi in aere."
-->
 And he replied: "Lord, I did not lecture in your land after
 your prohibition.  In truth I lectured in the air."

<!--
Tunc rex inhibuit ei ne in terra sua vel in aere suo
doceret. At ille intravit in naviculam et de navicula docebat
turbas discipulorum.  Cumque rex quadam die videret scholares
in ripa fluminis residentes, quaesivit quid hoc esset, et
dictum est ei quod magister Petrus in loco illo scholas
regebat, et cum magna indignatione fecit eum vocari et dixit
ei: "Nonne tibi inhibueram ne legeres in terra mea vel in
aere?"
-->
 Then the king forbade him to teach in his land or in his
 air.  But he boarded a boat and taught crowds of followers
 from the boat.  And one day, when the king saw the scholars
 sitting on the banks of the river, he asked what it was, and
 was told that Master Peter was running schools in that place,
 and with great indignation he ordered him to be summoned and
 said to him: "Did I not forbid you from lecturing in my land
 or in my air?"

<!--
Et illo respondente: "Nec in terra tua nec in aere legi, sed
in aqua tua," rex subridens et in mansuetudinem iram
convertens, ait: "Vicisti me; de cetero, ubicumque volueris,
tam in terra mea, quam in aere vel in aqua lege."
-->
 And he said in response: "In neither your land nor your air
 did I lecture, but in your water," the king, laughing, and
 turning anger to clemency, said: "You have defeated me,
 henceforth you may lecture wherever you wish, in my land, as
 well as in my air or in my water.
