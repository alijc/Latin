<!--XIV De Equo Praelati Quem Frater Eius Quadam Arte Obtinuit-->
<h4>The Prelate's Horse, That His Brother Got Through a Certain Trick</h4>

<p>
<!--
Audivi quod quidam praelatus in Francia optimum equum
habebat; frater autem eius miles valde desiderabat ipsum,
ut uteretur illo in torneamentis, et nullo modo potuit obtinere.
Tandem cum multis precibus obtinuit quod frater eius tribus
diebus equum sibi commodaret. 
-->
 I have heard that a certain prelate in France had a very
 useful horse; but his brother, a soldier, badly wanted it, to
 use it in tournaments, and couldn't get it in any way.  At
 last, with many prayers, he got his brother to lend the horse
 to him for three days.

<!--
Et accedens ad quendam capellanum dicti praelati coepit
diligenter inquirere cuiusmodi verba frater eius, dum
equitaret, diceret frequentius. At ille coepit cogitare et
respondit: "Dominus meus equitando dicit horassuas nec video
aliquod verbum quod frequentius dicat quam illud quod dicit
in principio cuiuslibet horae, id est: 'Deus in adiutorium
meum intende.'"
-->
 And, approaching one of the prelate chaplain's, his brother
 carefully began to seek out what sort of words he said most
 often while he was riding.  Now that one sat and thought and
 then replied: "When my lord is a-horse he says his offices,
 and I do not know any word that he says more often than what
 he says in the beginning of every office, that is: 'O God,
 reach out to aid me."

<!--
Tunc miles ille coepit equum sibi accommodatum equitare et
frequenter dicens verba praedicta, quotiens dicebat, fortiter
cum calcaribus equum pungebat et ita in triduo illo equum
instruxit ut, quotienscumque dicebat: "Deus in adiutorium meum
intende," equus timens calcaria, licet non pungeretur, magnos
saltus dabat et impetuose currens vix poterat retineri.
-->
 Then the soldier started to ride the horse and, frequently
 saying the aforesaid words, and as often as he said them he
 would prick the horse with his spurs and so within the three
 days he taught the horse so that, everytime he said: "O God,
 reach out to aid me," the horse, fearing the pricking of the
 spurs, would buck and bolt, and he could barely restrain it.

<!--
Postmodum, cum praelatus ille equum equitaret, frater eius
comitabatur eum ut videret finem. Cum autem praelatus diceret:
"Deus in adiutorium meum intende," equus coepit magnos saltus
dare et currere ita quod fere deiecit sessorem.
-->
 A little later, when the prelate was riding his horse, his
 brother went along to see the country.  But when the prelate
 said: "O God, reach out to aid me," the horse began to buck
 and bolt so that he nearly unseated his rider.

<!--
Cum autem pluries hoc fecisset dixit miles: "Domine, iste
equus non competit vobis, vos enim gravis persona estis et si
forte caderetis, multum laedi possetis."
-->
 Now when this had happened several times, the soldier said:
 "Lord, this horse is not agreeable to you, for you are an important
 person, and if you fall off, you could be injured."

<!--
Tunc praelatus valde tristis effectus ait: "Equus iste
composito gradu valde suaviter me ferre solebat, nunc autem —
nescio quomodo istud accidit illi — doleo quod equum bonum
amisi, sed ex quo ita est, accipe ilium; magis autem
competit militibus quam praelatis." Et ita equum optatum
obtinuit.
-->
 Then the prelate said with deep sorrow: "This horse used to
 have a smooth gait that was pleasant to me, but now - I know
 not how it befell him - I grieve that I have lost a good
 horse, but since it is so, please have it; for it is more fit
 for soldiers than for prelates."  And so he got the horse that
 he had wished for.
