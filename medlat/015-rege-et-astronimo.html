<!--XV De Rege et Eius Astronimo-->
<h4>A King and His Astrologer</h4>

<p>
<!--
Contra ilios vero qui luminaria caeli dicunt esse in signa
futurorum et in auguriis et divinationibus confidunt audivi
quod astrologus quidam cum aliquando vera divinaret, sicut
etiam daemones quaedam praevident futura, rex, de cuius
familia erat, coepit ei valde credere et in eius divinationibus
confidere. Quadam autem die valde tristis stabat coram rege;
cum rex ab eo quaereret quare tristaretur et maestus esset,
nolebat dicere ei; tandem ad multam instantiam lugens et
dolens in secreto dixit regi: "Domine, respexi in astralabio meo
et pro certo ex dispositione stellarum perpendi quod non potestis
vivere nisi dimidio anno."
-->
 Indeed, I have heard this against those who say that the stars in
 the sky are signs of the future and rely upon auguries and
 divinations.  There once was a certain astrologer who divined the
 truth, even as some demons foresee future events.  The king in
 whose household he lived began to have great faith in him and to
 believe in his divinations.  But on a certain day of great sorrow
 he stood in the presence of the king; when the king inquired of
 him why he grieved and was sad, he was unwilling to tell him.  In
 the end to great urging, lamenting and sorrowing he said to the
 king in secret: "Lord, I gazed into my astrolabe and have reached
 a certain conclusion from the disposition of the stars that you
 cannot live above a half-year."

<!--
Quo audito rex credidit et coepit singulis diebus angustiari,
macerari et valde tristis esse, ita quod milites multum
mirabantur et dolebant. Nam rex more solito nolebat eos hilariter
videre vel loqui eis. Tandem ad multas preces et instantiam
unius, qui magis familiaris erat ei, confessus est quod
clericus eius, qui optimus erat astronimus, de morte imminente
praedixerat ei. Tunc miles ille, metuens ne rex nimia tristitia
absorberetur et gravem incurrens infirmitatem moreretur (nam et
multi metu moriendi moriuntur), vocato coram omnibus astronimo,
dixit illi: "Quomodo tu certus es de morte regis?"
-->
 When the king heard this he believed it and within a few days
 became distressed, worried and very sad, so his soldiers greatly
 wondered at it and sorrowed.  For the king, as he was wont to do,
 was unwilling to look on them cheerfully or to speak to them.  In
 the end, at the many prayers and urging of one of them, who was
 most intimate with him, he admitted that his priest, who was the
 best astrologer, had predicted his imminent death to him.  Then
 the soldier, fearing lest the king, overwhelmed by so much
 grief, should meet with a grave illness and die (for many die
 from even the fear of death), called the astrologer into the
 presense of all, and said to him: "Why are you sure about the
 death of the king?"

<!--
Qui respondit: "Certus sum de morte eius, quam ex arte mea, quae
infallibilis est, perpendi."  Cui miles: "Melius debes scire de
te ipso quam de alio. Scis quanto victurus es tempore?" At
ille: "Scio utique et certus sum quod citra viginti annos non
moriar." Cui miles: "Mentitus es in caput tuum."
-->
 And he replied: "I am sure about his death, because I have
 assessed it carefully by reason of my skill, which is
 infallible." Then said the soldier: "You should know better about
 yourself than about another.  Do you know how long you have to
 live?" But he said: "I certainly know and am sure that I'll not
 die within these twenty years." And the soldier said to him: "You
 have lied with your head."

<!--
Et extracto cultello coram cunctis occidit eum. Tunc rex
attendens quod divinationes astronimi mendaces essent, resumptis
viribus confortatus est et postea diu vixit.
-->
 And he drew his dagger and killed him in the presense of them
 all.  Then the king attending that the divinations of astrologers
 are false, recovered his strength and waxed strong, and lived for
 a long time afterwards.
