<!--XVI De Illo Qui Diversos Morbos in Damnum Suum Aperuit-->
<h4>The Man Who Uncovered Different Diseases to His Own Financial Loss</h4>

<p>
<!--
Hi autem qui peccata sua excusant et ad imitationem priorum
parentum, dum peccata sua defendere volunt, peccata peccatis
addunt similes sunt cuidam qui iter faciebat per civitatem,
cui talis erat consuetudo, quod, quicumque extraneus
transibat, pro quolibet morbo seu macula, quam in corpore
habebat, unum denarium solvebat.
-->
 Now there are those who excuse their sins and, in imitation
 of the first parents, as long as they wish to defend their
 sins, they add sins to sins.  They are like a certain man who
 was travelling through the city who had the custom of 
 giving a silver coin to any foreigner that passed, for
 whatever disease or blemish that he had on his body.

<!--
Erat autem ille homo luscus.  Cum vero unus denarius ab eo
peteretur coepit se defendere et dicere quod non solveret et,
dum hoc diceret, apparuit quod erat balbus seu blaesus. Unde
et pro secundo vitio alium denarium exegerunt ab eo.  Qui si
tacuisset, damnum non duplicasset.
-->

 Now there was a one-eyed man there.  Indeed he began to ask
 him for a silver coin to protect himself and to say that lest
 he not give and, while he was saying this, it appeared that
 he was stuttering and stammering.  And from this for the
 second aliment he forced out another silver coin from him.
 And if he hed kept silent, he wouldn't have doubled the
 damage.

<!--
Ipso autem arripiente frenum suum ut diverteret et ad partem
aliam equum converteret, apparuit quod manus aliquantulum
incurvata erat nec eam plene extendere poterat, et pro tertio
morbo tertium denarium petierunt ab eo. Cum vero valde iratus
de equo descenderet et se ad defendendum pararet, apparuit
quod claudicaret et ob hoc quartum denarium ab eo exegerunt.
-->

 But that one, taking hold of his bridle to turn aside and
 turning his horse in a different direction, it appeared that
 his hand was slightly crooked and he could not fully extend
 it, and for this third aliment they begged a third silver
 coin from him.  Indeed when he, greatly vexed, dismounted and
 got ready to defend himself, it appeared that he was lame and
 on account of this squeezed a fourth silver coin from him.

<!--
Illo vero exuente cappam, ut magis expeditus esset ad
pugnandum, apparuit quod strumam in dorso haberet, et ita
oportuit quod quintum denarium persolveret, nam quanto
amplius se defendere voluit, tanto maius damnum semper
incurrit.
-->

 Indeed, pulling off his cape, to be better ready for a fight,
 it appeared that he had a tumor on his back, and so demanded
 that a fifth silver coin be paid out, for he wished to
 protect himself by such greater, than he met with ever
 greater loss.
