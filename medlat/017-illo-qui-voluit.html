<!--XVII De Illo Qui Voluit Emere Cantilenas-->
<h4>The Man Who Wanted to Buy Ditties</h4>

<p>
<!--
Sicut fures in carcere non cantant, ita nos in hoc exilio potius
lugeremus quam vanitatis et lasciviae cantilenas cantaremus.
Quidam enim in maioribus sollemnitatibus magis vacant
cantilenis et vanitatibus.
-->

 Just as thieves don't sing in jail, so let us mourn in this
 exile rather than sing ditties of vanity and wantonness.  For 
 some men in the great solemnities are idle with ditties and
 vanities. 

<!--
Audivi de quodam fatuo rustico qui, imminente festo sancti
villae suae, perrexit ad proximae civitatis nundinas ut emeret
cantilenas. Quidam autem truffator dixit quod venderet ei
saccum plenum optimis cantilenis et implevit saccum muscis
quibusdam pungitivis, quae vespae appellantur, quae more suo
cantabant in sacco.
-->

 I have heard about a certian foolish peasant who, as the feast
 day of his village's saint drew near, proceeded to the market
 days of the neighboring towns to buy ditties.  Now a certain
 joker said that he would sell him a sack full of the best
 ditties and filled a sack with stinging flies, which are
 called wasps, that sang in their fashion in the sack.

<!--
Cumque audisset rusticus gavisus est valde dicens: "Si ita
cantant intra saccum, quanto magis extra cantabunt." Et cum
tulisset saccum in die festo, ubi omnes congregati erant ante
ecclesiam in platea, aperto sacco vespae famelicae omnes
invaserunt et usque ad sanguinem pungendo et mordendo
vulneraverunt, ita quod in luctum versae sunt cantilenae.
-->

 And when the peasant had heard this he was overjoyed and said:
 "If they sing so inside the sack, how much more will they sing
 outside of it."  And when he had borne the sack on the feast
 day, where all had assembled in front of the church in the
 plaza, he opened the sack and all the hungry wasps attacked and
 wounded to the point of blood, stinging and biting, so that the
 ditties were turned into mourning.
