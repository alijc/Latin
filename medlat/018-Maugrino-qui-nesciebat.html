<!--XVII De Maugrino, Qui Nesciebat Chartam-->
<h4>Maugrinus, Who Didn't Know How to Read and Write</h4>

<!--
Hic est Maugrinus, quem episcopus suus, quando pecunia
indigebat, ad se vocabat et, sicut providerat, praesentatis
sibi litteris coram Maugrino, dicebat: "Domine Maugrine, ego
patior in oculis, non possum ad praesens legere chartam istam;
legatis mihi illam." Ille vero, qui legere nesciebat,
agnoscens intentionem episcopi, apertis litteris dicebat:
"Domine, in hac charta continetur quod vos pecunia multum
indigetis et quod ego decem marcas accommodem vobis." Et ita
soluta pecunia manus episcopi evadebat.

 This man is Maugrinus.  Whenever money was short his bishop would
 summon him, so that he might make provision, presenting a letter in
 Maugrinus' presence, and say: "Lord Maugrinus, my eyes are
 poor, I cannot at present read this letter; please read it
 to me."  Indeed that one, who was illiterate, recognizing the
 intention of his bishop, opened the letter and said: "Lord,
 in this letter it is maintained that you need much money and
 that I am to bring ten marks to you." And so the money was
 released into the hands of the bishop.
