<!--XIX De Maugrino, Qui Scholarem Ligari Fecit-->
<h4>Maugrinus, Who Caused the Scholar to Be Tied Up</h4>

<!--
Hic autem sacerdos valde inlitteratus erat et pecuniosus atque
avarus. Et accidit quod in parochia eius, quae erat in civitate
Parisiensi, quidam scholaris infirmaretur, et mittens pro eo coepit
Latine peccata sua confiteri. Sacerdos vero, non intellegens quid
diceret, vocavit servientes clerici et ait: "Dominus vester
versus est in frenesim et nescit quid dicat; ligate eum, ne
aliquem insaniendo laedat."
-->
 Now this priest was very ignorant and both wealthy and greedy.
 And it happened that in his parish, which was in the city of
 Paris, a certain scholar was ailing, and sending for him, began to
 confess his sins in Latin.  Indeed the priest, not understanding
 what he was saying, called the student's servants and said: "Your
 lord in a fit of madness and knows not what he says; bind him,
 lest he injure someone in his frenzy."

<!--
Sanatus autem clericus conquestus est episcopo Parisiensi de
sacerdote illo qui eum ligari fecit et freneticum reputavit eo
quod Latinis verbis, cum nesciret Gallicam linguam, suam faciebat
confessionem.  Episcopus vero, simulata aegritudine, misit pro
sacerdote et ait illi: "Maugrine domine" (sic enim vocabatur homo
ille), "vos estis homo sapiens et discretus; et ideo misi pro
vobis ut confessionem vobis faciam et iniungatis mihi
paenitentiam."
-->
 But after he was well the student complained to the bishop of
 Paris about the priest who had him tied up and thought him mad
 because he used Latin words (since he didn't know the Gallic
 language) when he made his confession.  Indeed the bishop,
 pretending to be ill, sent for the priest and said to him: "Lord
 Maugrinus" (for that man was so named), "you are a wise and
 discrete man; and therefore I sent for you that I might make
 confession to you and you might give me my penance."

<!--
Cum autem ille se excusaret et episcopus non acquiesceret coepit
Latinis verbis loqui ei ex dialectica et aliis facultatibus,
tamquam confessionem suam faceret et Latinis verbis peccata
diceret. Maugrinus vero ad singula verba dicebat: "Deus vobis
indulgeat." Tandem episcopus non valens amplius a risu continere
respondit: "Et Deus numquam mihi indulgeat; sed nec ego indulgeo
tibi." Et cum vellet ei auferre parochiam redemit se centum
libris.*
-->
 Now since he justified himself and the bishop was not assenting he
 began to speak with Latin words to him according to logic and
 other subjects, as if he were making his confession and naming his
 sins with Latin words.  Indeed Maugrinus said at every word: "May
 God forgive you." In the end the bishop, no longer able to contain
 his laughter, said: "And may God never forgive me; but neither do I
 forgive you."  And since he wished to remove the parish from him
 he bought it back for a hundred pounds.
