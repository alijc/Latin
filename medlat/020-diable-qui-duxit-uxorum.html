<!--XX De Diabolo Qui Duxit Uxorem Cuius Litigia Non Poterat Sustinere-->
<h4>The Devil Who Took a Wife Whose Quarrels He Couldn't Put Up With</h4>

<!--
Audivi quod quidam daemon in specie hominis cuidam diviti
homini serviebat et, cum servitium eius et industria multum
placerent homini, dedit ei filiam suam in uxorem et divitias
multas. Ilia autem omni die et nocte litigabat cum marito
suo nec eum quiescere permittebat. In fine autem anni dixit
patri uxoris suae: "Volo recedere et in patriam meam redire."
-->
 I have heard that a certain demon was serving a certain man who
 was rich in coin and, since his service and industry pleased the
 man a great deal, he gave him his daughter in marriage, along
 with great riches.  But these quarreled all day and night and
 the husband was allowed no rest.  Now at the end of a year he
 said to his wife's father: "I want to move away and to return to
 my own country."

<!--
Cui pater uxoris ait: "Nonne multa tibi dedi ita quod nihil desit
tibi? Quare vis recedere?" Dixit ille: "Modis omnibus volo
repatriare." Cui socer ait: "Ubi est patria tua?" Ait ille:
"Dicam tibi et veritatem non celabo; patria mea est infernus,
ubi numquam tantam discordiam vel molestiam sustinui quantam hoc
anno passus sum a litigiosa uxore mea. Malo esse in inferno quam
amplius cum ipsa commorari." Et hoc dicto ab oculis eorum
evanuit.
-->
 And his wife's father said to him: "Have I not given you so much
 that you can want for nothing?"  And he said: "By all means I
 wish to return to my own country."  And his father-in-law said
 to him: "Where is your country?" And he said: "I will tell you,
 and not conceal the truth; my country is Hell, where I have
 never put up with such discord or trouble as I have suffered
 this year from the quarrels of my wife.  Better for me to be in
 hell than to abide with this one any more." And having said
 these words he vanished before their eyes.
