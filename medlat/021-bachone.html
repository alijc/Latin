<!--XXI De Bachone Qui Pendebat in Quadam Villa-->
<h4>The Rasher of Bacon That Was Hanging in a Certain Village</h4>

<!--
Aliquando transivi per quandam villam in Francia, ubi
suspenderant pernam seu bachonem in platea hac condicione
ut, qui vellet iuramento firmare quod uno integro anno
post contractum matrimonium permansisset cum uxore ita
quod de matrimonio non paenituisset, bachonem
haberet. Et cum per decem annos ibi pependisset non est
unus solus inventus qui bachonem lucraretur, omnibus
infra annum de matrimonio contracto paenitentibus.
-->
 I once passed through a certain village in France, where
 they'd hung a ham or bacon in the village square, with
 the condition that anyone who wished to swear an oath that
 he and his wife had passed an entire year after their
 marriage without being dissatisfied with the marriage
 could have the bacon.  And when it had hung there for 
 ten years not even one person was found who won the bacon,
 with everyone repenting of their marriage within a year.
