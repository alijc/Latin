<!--XXII Exemplum Contra Malitiam Mulierum et de Illo Cui Pater Dedit Uxorem-->
<h4>An Example Against the Malice of Women and<br> 
the Man Whose Father Gave Him a Wife</h4>

<p>
<!--
Ecce quam pauci hodie uxoribus suis adhaerent fide et
dilectione sicut instituit Dominus noster Iesus Christus
qui est benedictus in saecula saeculorum. Amen.
-->
 See how few men today cleave to their wives in love and
 good faith, as was established by our Lord Jesus Christ,
 who is blessed forever and ever.  Amen.

Ut autem de malitia filiarum Evae aliquid subdam, nolui
sub silentio praeterire quod audivi de quodam iuvene, qui
rogabat patrem suum ut ei duas uxores daret. Cumque
vehementer instaret dedit ei pater unam, promittens quod in
fine anni daret alteram. Illa vero adeo primo anno maritum
afflixit quod non poterat sustinere sed mallet mori quam
vivere. Cumque pater finito anno diceret filio: "Vis habere
secundam uxorem?" respondit ille: "Si una me afflixit fere
usque ad mortem, quomodo duas ferre possem?"
-->
 But, that I might add aught about the malice of the
 daughters of Eve, I don't wish to pass in silence what I
 have heard about a certain youth, who used to ask his
 father to give him two wives.  And since he pressed hard,
 his father gave him one, promising that at the end of a
 year he would give him another.  Indeed, that one so
 vexed her husband in the first year that he could not
 put up with her, but preferred death over life.  And when
 at the end of the year his father said to the son: "Do you
 wish to have your second wife?"  he replied: "If one
 afflicts me to the point of death, how could I bear two?"

<!--
Accidit autem in civitate ilia ut caperetur maleficus et
latro pessimus, qui multos de civitate illa spoliaverat et
occiderat. Cumque cives convenirent et quaereret iudex a
singulis ut quilibet consilium suum daret quomodo latro
ille magis torqueri valeret, quibusdam dicentibus:
"Distrahatur caudis equorum et suspendatur," aliis
dicentibus: "Igne cremetur," ceteris vero consulentibus ut
vivus excoriaretur, cum perventum fuisset ad illum qui
malam habebat uxorem, respondit: "Date illi uxorem meam;
non video qualiter ipsum magis affligere valeatis."
-->
 Now it happened in that city that a nefarious and wicked
 robber was captured, who had robbed and murdered many in
 that city.  And when the citizens assembled and the judge
 asked each one for his advice on how this robber should
 best be tortured, with some saying: "Let him be torn apart
 by horses and then hung," and others: "Let him be burned
 to death," and indeed the rest decided that he should be
 flayed alive, but when he came to the one who had a bad
 wife, he replied: "Give my wife to him; I don't see how
 you could effect any greater damage to him."
