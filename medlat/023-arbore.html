<!--XXIII De Arbore in Qua se Suspendebant Mulieres-->
<h4>The Tree in Which Women Hung Themselves</h4>

<!--
De quodam alio audivi, qui habebat arborem in horto suo,
in qua duae eius uxores suspenderant semetipsas. Cui quidam
eius vicinus ait: "Valde fortunata est arbor illa et bonum
omen habet. Habeo autem uxorem pessimam; rogo te, da mihi 
surculum ex ea, ut plantem in horto meo."
-->
 I have heard of another man who had a tree in his garden,
 in which his two wives had hung themselves.  And one of his
 neighbors said to him: "That tree is very lucky and has a
 good omen.  But I have the worst wife; I prithee, give me
 a shoot of it, to plant in my garden."
