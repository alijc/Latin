<!--XXIV De Sectanda Fidelitate-->
<h4>Keeping Faith</h4>

<p>
<!--
Rex quidam regnavit in cuius imperio erat quidam iuvenis
a piratis captus, qui scripsit patri suo pro redemptione. Pater
noluit eum redimere sic quod iuvenis multo tempore in carcere
erat maceratus. Ille qui eum in vinculis habebat quandam
pulchram filiam ac oculis hominum gratiosam genuerat, quae
nutrita in domo erat quousque viginti annos in aetate sua
compleverat, quae saepius incarceratum visitatum ivit ac
consolabatur. Sed ille in tantum desolatus erat quod nullam
consolationem recipere poterat sed suspiria et gemitus continue
emittebat.

 There once was a king in whose empire there was a young man
 was captured by pirates, and who wrote to his father to ransom
 him.  The father had no wish to redeem him, so the young man
 wasted away for a long time in prison. The man who held him in
 chains had a daughter who was beautiful and agreeable to the
 eyes of men, who had been raised in the house until she was
 twenty years old, who often went to visit the prisoner and
 console him.  But he was so wretched that he could accept no
 consolation, but continuously let out sighs and groans.

<!--
Accidit quodam die quod, cum puella eum visitaret, ait iuvenis
ei: "O bona puella, utinam velles pro mea liberatione
laborare!" Quae ait: "Quomodo potero hoc attentare? Pater tuus
qui te genuit non vult te redimere, ego vero, cum sim tibi
extranea, quomodo deberem hoc cogitare? Et si te liberarem
offensionem patris mei incurrerem quia tuam redemptionem
perderet pater meus. Verumtamen mihi unum concede et liberabo
te."
-->
 One day it happened that, when the maiden visited him, the
 young man said to her: "O noble maiden, if you only wished to
 work for my release!"  And she said: "How could I try this?
 Your father, who sired you, is surely unwilling to ransom you,
 since I am but stranger to you, why should I consider this?
 And if I were to free you I would incur the displeasure of my
 father, since your release would ruin my father.  Nevertheless
 grant me one thing and I will free you."

<!--
Ait ille: "O bona puella, pete a me quid tibi placuerit. Si
mihi est possibile ego concedam." At ilia: "Nihil aliud peto
pro tua liberatione nisi quod me in uxorem ducas tempore
opportuno." Qui ait: "Hoc tibi firmiter promitto."
-->
 He said: "O noble maiden, ask of me what you will.  If I can I
 will grant it."  But she said: "I ask nothing for your
 release, except that you wed me at a suitable time." And he
 said: "This I firmly promise you."

<!--
Statim puella patre ignorante ipsum a vinculis liberavit et cum
eo ad patriam suam fugit. Cum vero ad patrem suum venisset,
ait ei pater: "O fili, de tuo adventu gaudeo. Sed dic mihi
qualis est 16 ista puella quam tecum duxisti?" Ait ille: "Filia
regis est quam in uxorem habeo."
-->
 At once the maiden, without her father knowing, freed him from
 his chains and fled with him to his father.  Indeed, when he
 had come to his father, his father said to him: "O son, I
 rejoice at your coming.  But tell me who is the maiden that
 you have brought with you?"  And he said: "She is the daughter
 of a king, whom I am marrying."

<!--
Ait pater: "Sub poena amissionis hereditatis tuae nolo ut eam
in uxorem ducas." Ait ille: "O pater, quid dicis?  Plus ei
teneor quam tibi. Quando captus eram in manus inimici et
fortiter vinculatus tibi pro mea redemptione scripsi et
noluisti me redimere. Ipsa vero non tantum a carcere sed
a periculo mortis me liberavit; ideo eam in uxorem ducere
volo."
-->
 His father said: "Under the pain of the loss of your
 inheritence, I don't want you to marry her."  And he said: "O
 father, what are you saying?  I am bound to her more than
 to you.  When I had been captured into the hands of the enemy
 and strongly fettered I wrote to you for my ransom and you
 didn't wish to redeem me.  Indeed she freed me not only from
 imprisonment but also from mortal danger; for that reason I
 wish to marry her."

<!--
Ait pater: "Fili, probo tibi quod non possis in eam confidere
et per consequens nullo modo in uxorem ducere.  Patrem proprium
decepit quando ipso ignorante te a carcere liberavit. Pro qua
liberatione pater eius multa perdidit quae pro tua redemptione
habuisset. Ergo videtur quod tu non possis in eam confidere et
per consequens nullo modo in uxorem ducere. Item alia ratio
est. Ista licet te liberavit hoc fuit causa libidinis ut posset
te in virum habere et ideo quia eius libido erat causa
liberationis tuae non mihi videtur quod uxor tua erit."
-->
 His father said: "Son, I will demonstrate to you that you cannot
 have faith in her and consequently there is no way to wed
 her. She deceived her own father when she freed you from
 captivity without his knowledge.  On account of which release
 her father has lost much which he might have had for your
 ransom. Therefore it seems that you cannot have faith in her
 and consequently there is no way that you can wed her.  Also,
 there is another reason.  Granted she released you - this
 was by reason of her desire to have you as a husband and
 likewise because her lust was the reason for your release, it
 doesn't seem to me that she should be your wife."

<!--
Puella audiens istas rationes ait: "Ad primam respondeo quando
dicis quod ego decepi patrem meum proprium quod non est
verum. Ille decipitur qui in aliquo bono diminuitur. Sed pater
meus tam locuples est quod alicuius auxilio non indiget. Cum
hoc perpendi, iuvenem istum a carcere liberavi et si pater meus
pro eo redemptionem accepisset non multum propter hoc ditior
fuisset et tu per redemptionem depauperatus esses. Ergo in isto
actu te salvavi quod redemptionem non dedisti, et patri meo
nullam iniuriam feci.  Ad aliam rationem quando dicis quod ego
ex libidine hoc feci respondeo: hoc nullo modo potest fieri
quia libido aut est propter pulchritudinem aut propter divitias
aut propter fortitudinem. Sed filius tuus nullum istorum habuit
quia pulchritudo eius per carcerem erat annihilata; nec dives
fuit quia non habuit unde se ipsum redimeret; nec fortis quia
fortitudinem perdidit per carceris macerationem. Ergo sola
pietas me movebat quod ipsum liberavi." Pater hoc audiens non
potuit filium arguere ulterius. Filius ergo cum magna
sollemnitate finivit.

 The maiden listened to these reasons, then said: "To the
 first, I answer that when you say that I deceived my own
 father, it is not true. He is deceived who suffers loss in any
 good.  But my father is so wealthy that he needs nothing more.
 As I weighed this matter carefully, I released this young man
 from prison and if my father had received his ransom he would
 have been no wealthier on account of this and you would have
 been improverished from the ransom.  And so by this act I have
 saved you, because you didn't pay the ransom, and I gave no
 injury to my father.  To the second reason, when you say that
 I did this out of lust I reply: In no way could this happen,
 since lust is on account either of beauty or of riches or of
 strength. But your son had none of these, since his beauty had
 been destroyed in prison; neither was he rich, since he had
 not even the means to ransom himself; and not strong either,
 since he had lost his strength through the weaking effect of prison.
 Therefore only pity moved me to set him free."  His father
 listened to this and could not blame his son any further.  And
 so the son ended with a great solemnity.

Moralisatio. Carissimi, filius captus a piratis erat totum
genus humanum, captum per peccatum primi parentis in carcere
daemonis, scilicet in eius potestate. Pater, qui noluit eum
redimere, est mundus iste, qui nullo modo volebat hominem
iuvare a carcere diaboli sed potius eum tenere. Filia, quae eum
in carcere visitavit, est divinitas animae coniuncta, quae
humano generi compatiebatur, quae post passionem suam ad
infernum descendit et hominem a vinculis diaboli liberavit.
Pater vero caelestis nostris divitiis non indiget quia super
omnia est dives et summe bonus. Ideo Christus motus pietate ad
nos de caelis descendit, nos visitavit, quando carnem nostram
assumpsit, et tamen nihil aliud petiit pro nostra redemptione
nisi quod sit homini desponsatus, iuxta illud Oseae ii:
"Desponsabo eam mihi in fide." Verum tamen pater noster
mundus, cui multi oboediunt, contra hoc semper murmurat et
allegat: "Si Deo adhaereas, hereditatem meam, id est, mundana,
non habebis, quia impossibile est Deo servire et Mammonae,
Matth. vi." Sed melius est nobis spernere mundum quam
societatem Dei amittere, iuxta illud Matth.: "Qui reliquerit
patrem et matrem, uxorem aut agros propter me, centuplum
accipiet et vitam aeternam possidebit. Quam nobis" etc.

 The moral.  Dearly beloved, the son who had been captured by
 pirates is the whole race of mankind, captive of the sin of
 our first parents and in the prison of daemons, surely within
 their power.  The father, who didn't wish to ransom his son,
 is this world, which in no way wishes to assist a human being
 from out of the prison of the devil but would rather hold him
 more firmly.  The daughter, who visited him in prison, is the
 conjoined divinity of the soul, which feels pity towards the
 human race, and which after the Passion descended into hell
 and freed man from the chains of the devil.  Indeed the
 heavenly father doesn't need our wealth, since he above all is
 rich and supremely good.  Likewise, Christ, moved by pity
 descended to us from heaven, visited us, when he assumed our
 flesh, and asked nothing else in return for our redemption but
 that he be betrothed to man, just as in Hosea ii: "I will
 betroth her to me in faith."  Yet in truth our pure father,
 obeyed by many, always murmurs against this and alleges: "If
 you cling to God, you will not have my inheritance, that is,
 the world, since it is impossible to serve both God and
 Mammon, Matth. vi."  But it is better for us to spurn the
 world than to lose the society of God, as Matth. says: "He who
 leaves his father and mother, his wife or his fields on
 account of me, will receive a hundred-fold and will possess
 eternal life."
