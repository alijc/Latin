<!--XXV De Versutia Diaboli et Quomodo Dei Iudicia Sunt Occulta-->
<h4>The Crafts of the Devil and How God's Judgement is Hidden</h4>

<!--
Erat quidam heremita qui in quadam spelunca iacebat et
diebus et noctibus devote Deo serviebat. Iuxta cellam suam
erat quidam pastor ovium qui pascebat oves. Accidit uno die
quod pastor erat somno oppressus; ipso dormiente quidam latro
venit et omnes oves secum abstulit. Superveniens dominus
ovium a pastore quaerit ubi oves erant; ille vero incepit iurare
quod oves perdidit, sed quomodo penitus ignorabat. Dominus
hoc audiens, furore repletus, ipsum occidit.
-->
 There once was a hermit who dwelt in a cave and day and night
 devotedly served God. Near his cell there was a shepherd who
 grazed his sheep.  It fell out one day that the shepherd was
 overwhelmed by sleep; while he slept a certain thief came and
 stole all of his sheep away.  When the sheep's owner arrived he
 asked the shepherd where the sheep were; indeed he began to
 swear that he lost the sheep, but he didn't at all know how.
 The owner listened to him, filled with rage, and killed him.

<!--
Heremita hoc videns ait in corde suo: "O Domine, ecce homo iste
culpam innocenti dedit et ipsum occidit; ex quo ergo permittatis
talia fieri, ad mundum vadam et sicut ceteri vitam ducam."  His
cogitatis heremitarium dimisit et ad mundum perrexit; sed Deus
ipsum dimittere nolebat et angelum in forma hominis ad eum misit
ut ei se associaret.
-->
 The hermit saw this and said in his heart: "O Lord, lo that man
 gave offense to the innocent and killed him; since you allow
 such to happen, I will walk the world and so lead a different
 life."  Having reflected on this, he left his hermitage and
 went out into the world; but God was unwilling to let him go
 and sent an angel to him, in the form of a man, so that he
 might join him.

<!--
Cum eum angelus in via euntem invenisset, ait ei: "Carissime,
quo vadis?" At ille: "Ad istam civitatem ante me." Angelus
dixit ei: "Ego in via ero comes tuus, quia angelus Dei sum ego,
et ad te veni ut simus socii in hac via."
-->
 When the angel had come upon him walking on the road, it said
 to him: "Dearest, are you going?"  And he said: "To that city
 before me." The angel said to him: "I will be your comrade on
 the road, for an angel of God am I, and I came to you so that
 we might be companions on the road."

<!--
Ambo ambulabant versus civitatem; cum autem intrassent,
hospitium a quodam milite propter Dei amorem petebant, miles
vero satis gratanter eos recepit et honorifice ac splendide
cum bona devotione in omnibus ministravit.  Miles iste
tantum unicum filium habebat in cunabulis iacentem, quem multum
dilexerat. Cena facta, camera 11 est aperta et lecti satis
honorifice ornati pro angelo et heremita.
-->
 The pair of them walked towards the city; but when they'd
 entered it, they asked for hospitality, for the love of God, of
 a certain soldier, indeed the soldier received them quite
 joyfully and attended to them honorably and splendidly with
 good zeal in all things.  This soldier had only one son, asleep
 in his cradle, whom he greatly loved.  When supper was done,
 the room was opened and beds quite honorably equipped for the
 angel and the hermit.

<!--
Media vero nocte surrexit angelus et puerum in cunabulis
strangulavit. Hoc videns heremita intra se cogitavit: "Numquid
iste erat angelus Dei bonus? Miles omnia necessaria propter Dei
amorem ei dedit, et non habuit nisi unicum filium innocentem, et
iste eum occidit!" Sed tamen non audebat ei quicquam dicere.
-->
 Indeed, in the middle of the night the angel got up and
 smothered the boy in the cradle.  The hermit saw this and
 thought to himself: "Surely that wasn't a good angel of God?
 The soldier gave him everything that was needful for the love
 of God, and having but a single innocent son, and he killed
 him!" But in the end he dared not say anything to him.

<!--
Mane vero ambo surrexerunt et ad civitatem aliam perrexerunt, in
qua in domo unius civis satis honorifice erant recepti et
splendide ministrati. Civis iste quendam aureum ciphum, quem
miro modo dilexit, habuit. Media vero nocte surrexit angelus et
furatus est ciphum ilium. Heremita hoc videns intra se
cogitabat: "Iste malus angelus est, ut credo; iste civis nobis
optime fecit et iste est furatus ciphum suum." Tamen nihil ei
loquebatur quia timuit eum.
-->
 Indeed, in the morning they arose and proceeded to another
 city, in which in a house of one citizen they were received
 quite honorably and splendidly attended.  This citizen had a
 certain golden goblet, which he valued in a remarkable way.
 Indeed in the middle of the night the angel arose and stole
 this goblet.  The hermit saw this and thought to himself: "This
 is an evil angel, as I believe; this citizen has done well by
 us and he has stolen his goblet."  But he said nothing to him
 because he was afraid of him.

<!--
Mane vero surrexerunt et per viam ambulabant donec ad quandam
aquam pervenerunt, ultra quam erat pons. Pontem ascenderunt et
quidam pauper eis obviabat. Ait angelus: "Carissime, monstra
nobis viam versus talem civitatem." Pauper vertit se et cum
digito viam versus civitatem ostendit. Cum vero vertisset se,
angelus subito per scapulas eum accepit et ultra pontem
proiecit, et submersus est pauper. Quodcum heremita vidisset ait
in corde suo: "Iam scio quod iste diabolus est et non angelus
Dei bonus; quid mali fecit pauper iste?  Et tamen eum occidit."
Ab illo tempore cogitabat ab eo recedere, verumtamen timuit et
nihil loquebatur ei.
-->
 Indeed in the morning they arose and walked along the road
 until they came to some water, with a bridge over it.  They
 climbed onto the bridge and a certain poor man met them.  The
 angel said: "Dearest, show us the way to such and such city."
 The poor man turned and with his finger showed them the way to
 the city.  Indeed when he turned away, the angel suddenly took
 him by the shoulders and threw him off the bridge, and the poor
 man went under.  When the hermit saw this he said in his heart:
 "I already know that this is a devil and not a good angel of
 God; what evil did that poor man do?  And yet he killed him."
 From that time he considered withdrawing from him, but yet was
 afraid and said nothing to him.

<!--
Cum vero circa horam vespertinam ad civitatem pervenissent, ad
domum cuiusdam divitis accesserunt et hospitium pro Dei amore
petebant; ille vero simpliciter eis negavit. Ait angelus Dei:
"Amore Dei saltem, tectum domus nobis concedatis ne lupi aut
malae bestiae hic nos devorent." Ille ait: "Ecce domus ubi porci
mei iacent; si placet vobis cum eis iacere, potestis: sin
autem, recedatis quia alium locum vobis non dabo."  Ait ei
angelus: "Si aliud non potest fieri, cum porcis vestris is
iacebimus." Et sic factum est.
-->
 Indeed, after they reached the city around the hour of vespers,
 they came to the house of a certain rich man and asked for
 hospitality for the love of God; and indeed he refused them
 outright.  The angel of God said: "For the love of God, you
 might at least allow us the roof of your house, lest some wolf
 or evil beast devour us here." And he said: "Yonder is my pig's
 sty; if it pleases you to lie with them, you may: but if not,
 then go away, since I won't give any other place."  The angel
 said to him: "If nothing else can be done, then we will lie
 with your pigs."  And so it was done.

<!--
Mane vero surrexerunt, angelus hospitem vocavit et ait:
"Carissime, do tibi ciphum istum." Et dedit ei ciphum quem
furatus fuerat ab illo cive.  Heremita hoc videns ait intra se:
"Iam sum expertus quod iste est diabolus; bonus homo erat qui
cum omni devotione nos recepit, et furatus est ei ciphum et
dedit isti pessimo qui negavit nobis hospitium." Ait angelo:
"Nolo vobiscum amplius expectare; ad Deum vos recommendo."
-->
 Indeed in the morning they arose, the angel called their host
 and said:  "Dearest, I give you this goblet."  And he gave him
 the goblet that he had stolen from the citizen.  The hermit saw
 this and said to himself: "I am already certain that this is a
 devil; it was a good man who received us with all devotion, and
 he stole the goblet from him and gave it to this horrible man
 who denied us hospitality."  The angel said: "I am unwilling to
 tarry any longer with you; adieu."

<!--
Angelus dixit ei: "Audite me et tunc recedite.  Primo, quando
eras in heremitario, dominus ovium pastorem iniuste
occidit. Scias quod pastor ille pro tunc mortem non meruit sed
alias commisit quare mori deberet; tunc temporis inventus est
sine peccato; Deus ergo permisit eum occidi, ut poenam post
mortem evaderet propter peccatum quod alias commisit pro quo
numquam paenitentiam faceret. Latro vero qui evasit cum ovibus
poenam aeternam sustinebit, et dominus ovium qui pastorem
occidit vitam suam emendabit per largas elemosinas et opera
misericordiae. Demum filium illius militis de nocte strangulavi
qui nobis bonum hospitium dedit. Scias quod antequam puer ille
natus erat, miles optimus elemosinarius erat et multa opera
misericordiae fecit sed postquam natus est puer factus est
parcus, cupidus et omnia collegit ut puerum divitem faciat, sic
quod erat causa perditionis eius, et ideo puerum occidi et iam,
sicut prius, miles factus est bonus christianus. Deinde ciphum
illius civis qui nos cum devotione recepit furatus fui; scias tu
quod, antequam ciphus ille erat fabricatus, non erat sobrior eo
in tota terra, sed tantum cipho gaudebat post fabricationem quod
omni die tantum de eo bibebat, quod bis aut ter omni die fuit
inebriatus, et ideo ciphum abstuli, et factus est sobrius sicut
prius. Deinde pauperem in aquam proieci; scias quod pauper iste
bonus christianus fuit, et si ad dimidium miliare ambulasset,
alium in peccato mortali occidisset, sed iam est salvatus et
regnat in caelesti gloria. Deinde ciphum illius civis dedi illi
qui nobis hospitium negavit; scias quod nihil in terra fit sine
causa; ipse nobis concessit domum porcorum et ideo ciphum ei
dedi, et post vitam istam in inferno regnabit. Pone ergo ammodo
custodiam ori tuo ut de Deo non attrahas; ipse enim omnia
novit." Heremita hoc audiens cecidit ad pedes angeli et veniam
petiit et ad heremitarium perrexit. Et factus est bonus
christianus.
-->
 The angel said to him: "Hear me and then withdraw.  First, when
 you were in the hermitage, the owner wrongfully killed the
 shepherd.  You should know that the shepherd didn't deserve to
 die at that time, but he had previously done that by which he
 ought to die; at that time he was found to be without sin;
 therefore God allowed him to be killed, so that he might escape
 his punishment after death on account of the sin that he
 committed previously, for which he was never punished.  Indeed
 the thief who ran off with the sheep will sustain eternal
 punishment, and the owner of the sheep who killed the shepherd
 will amend his life through large alms and works of mercy.
 Finally, I smothered the son of the soldier who gave us good
 hospitality.  You should know that before that boy was born,
 the soldier was a very good almsgiver and did many works of
 mercy, but after the boy was born he became stingy and greedy
 and amassed everything, so that the boy might become a rich
 man, so that was the cause of his perdition, and likewise I
 killed the boy and new, as before, the soldier has become a
 good christian.  Next, I stole the goblet of that citizen who
 received us with devotion; you should know that, before that
 goblet was made, there was not a man more sober than him in the
 whole world, but he rejoiced so much in the goblet after it was
 made that he would drink out of it all day long, and be drunk
 two or three days together, and likewise I stole the goblet,
 and he has become sober, as before.  Next I threw the poor man
 into the water; you should know that that poor man was a good
 christian, and if he had walked on for another half-mile, he
 would have fallen into mortal sin, but now he is saved and
 reigns in celestrial glory.  Next, I gave that citizen's
 goblet to the one who denied us hospitality; you should know
 that nothing on earth is without reason; he granted us his pig
 sty and likewise I gave him the goblet, and after this life he
 will reign in hell.  Therefore, henceforth put a guard on your
 mouth, so that you do not attract the censure of God; for he
 knows all."  The hermit listened to this and fell to the
 angel's feet and begged his indulgence and proceeded to his
 hermitage.  And became a good christian.
