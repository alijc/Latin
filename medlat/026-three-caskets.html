<h4>The Three Caskets</h4>

<p>
<!--
Honorius regnavit, dives valde, qui unicum filium habebat,
quem multum dilexit. Fama eius imperatoris per mundum volabat
quod in omnibus probus erat et iustus. Tamen contra unum regem
guerram habebat et eum devastabat. Rex iste cum multas
persecutiones ac damna infinita ab eo sustinebat tandem
cogitabat: "Tantum unicam filiam habeo et adversarius meus
unicum filium. Si per aliquam viam filiam meam possem
filio suo in matrimonium copulare pacem perpetuam obtinerem."
-->
 Honorius, immensely rich, reigned, and had only one son, whom
 he loved dearly.  The fame of this emperor flew throughout the
 world, because he was honest and just in all things.  But he
 waged a war against a king and devastated him.  After that
 king sustained many attacks and endless damage from the emperor, he
 finally thought: "I have only one daughter and my enemy only
 one son. If I could somehow join my daughter to his son then I
 would obtain everlasting peace."

<!--
Misit sollemnes nuntios ad imperatorem ut saltem ei trewgam ad
tempus concederet quod cum eo personaliter loqui
posset. Imperator habito consilio trewgam unius anni
concessit. Rex vero personaliter ad eum accessit et filiam
eius filio suo obtulit. At iste: "Non faciam nisi duo
habeam. Primo ut tua filia sit virgo; secundo ut post decessum
tuum totum regnum tuum filio meo destinetur." At ille: "Bene
placet mihi." Statim de conventione charta sigillata est. Rex
vale imperatori fecit.
-->
 He sent distinguished messengers to the emperor to ask him to
 grant at least a temporary truce so that he might speak with
 him in person.  The emperor took counsel and granted a one
 year's truce.  Indeed the king came to him in person and
 offered his own daughter for the other's son.  But the
 emperor said: "I will not do this unless I have two things.
 First, your daughter must be a virgin; Second, after your
 death your entire kingdom must be settled on my son."  And
 the king said: "This pleases me well." A charter for the
 contract was sealed at once.  The king bade the emperor
 farewell.

<!--
Cum autem ad regnum suum venerat navem parari fecit quia
oporteret ut filia sua per mare ad imperatorem
transiret. Facta nave et omnibus necessariis paratis, puella
intravit habens thesaurum secum in magna copia ac milites
quinque cum dominabus et ancillis. Cum autem per mare
navigarent cete grandis ei occurrebat in mare et navem
deglutire volebat. Nautae hoc percipientes timuerunt valde et
praecipue puella. Nautae vero ignem copiosum fecerunt et die
ac nocte vigilabant. Sed accidit post triduum quod, fessi
propter magnas vigilias, dormierunt. Cete subito navem cum
omnibus contentis deglutivit. Puella cum intellexit quod in
ventre ceti esset fortiter clamabat. Ad cuius clamorem omnes
excitati sunt.
-->
 Now when he had come to his own kingdom, he had a ship
 readied for the purpose of carrying his daughter across the
 sea to the emperor.  When the ship was ready and every needed
 prepared, the maiden boarded with her rich dowery and five
 soldiers with ladies and maids.  But while they were sailing
 across the sea a great whale rushed to meet them and tried to
 swallow the ship.  When they saw this the sailors trembled
 with fear, and the maiden even more so.  Indeed the sailors
 made a huge fire and stood guard day and night.  But it fell
 out after three days that, exhausted from their vigil, they
 fell asleep.  The whale suddenly swallowed the ship with all
 of its contents.  The girl, when she understood that she was
 in the belly of a whale, cried out loudly.  And the others
 were awoken by her cries.

<!--
Nautae vero puellae dixerunt ac militibus:
"Carissimi, estote confortati, Deus nos salvabit; habeamus
bonum consilium quia sumus in ventre ceti." Ait puella:
"Audite consilium meum et erimus salvati." Qui dixerunt:
"Dic." Quae ait: "Accendamus ignem in magna copia et cete
quilibet vulneret sicut profundius possit et per ista duo
mortem recipiet et statim ad terram natabit et sic per gratiam
Dei evadere poterimus." Illi vero consilium puellae per omnia
impleverunt. Cete cum mortem sensit ad terram perrexit.
-->
 Indeed the sailors said to the maiden and the soldiers:
 "Dearest ones, take courage, God will save us; let us take
 good counsel, for we are in the belly of a whale." The maiden
 said: "Listen to my counsel and we will be saved."  And they
 said: "Tell us."  She said: "Let's light a large fire, and
 have someone injure the whale as deeply as possible and by
 these two things it will receive its death-blow and will at
 once float to land, and so by God's grace we will escape."
 Indeed they fulfilled the maiden's advice in every way.  The
 whale sensed its death and headed for land.

<!--
Iuxta quam terram erat quidam miles manens, qui cena facta
versus litus maris ambulavit. Cum ergo cete hinc inde natare
vidisset et terrae appropinquare, servos vocat et cete ad
terram traxit. Qui inceperunt cum instrumentis
percutere. Puella cum sonitum audisset loquebatur pro omnibus
et ait: "Carissimi, suaviter percutite et latus ceti
aperite; hic sumus in eius ventre filii bonorum virorum de
generoso sanguine." Miles cum vocem puellae audisset ait
servis suis: "Carissimi, latus ceti aperite et videamus quid
lateat interius."
-->
 Hard by that beach there was a certain soldier stationed, who
 was taking an after-dinner amble along the seashore.  So when
 he saw the whale floating hither and thither and approaching
 the land, he calls his servants and they dragged the whale to
 land.  And they began to strike it with tools.  The maiden,
 when she heard the noise spoke before them all and said:
 "Dearest, strike gently and open the flank of the whale; we
 here in its belly are the sons of good men of noble birth."
 The soldier, when he heard the voice of the maiden said to
 his servants: "Dearest, open the flank of the whale and let
 us see what might lie hidden within."

<!--
Cum vero apertum fuisset, puella primo exivit immo quasi
mortua, deinde milites et ceteri alii. Coepit narrare cuius
filia esset et uxor filii imperatoris esse deberet.  Hoc
audiens miles eam per aliquot dies cum tota familia secum
retinuit donec perfectum 18 statum 18 suum recuperabant. Post
hoc puellam cum muneribus ad imperatorem misit cum tota
familia. Imperator cum eam vidisset, ait: "Carissima filia,
bene tibi sit nunc et in perpetuum.  Sed tibi dico, filia,
antequam filium meum habueris in maritum, te probabo per unum
actum."
-->
 Indeed when it was opened, the maiden came out first, more
 dead than alive, and then the soldiers and everyone else.
 She began to relate whose daughter she was, and that she was
 destined to be the wife of the emperor's son.  On hearing
 this, the soldier kept her and her retinue with him for
 several days, until they had recovered their health.  After
 that he sent the maiden with her gifts and her whole retinue
 to the emperor.  The emperor, when he saw her, said: "Dearest
 daughter, may it go well with you now and forever. But I tell
 you daughter, before you have my son in holy matrimony, I
 will test you with a single deed."

<!--
Statim fecit fieri tres cophinos. Primus erat de auro
purissimo et lapidibus pretiosis. Et erat talis superscriptio
super cophinum: "Qui me aperiet, in me invenerit quod meruit."
Et totus cophinus erat plenus ossibus mortuorum. Secundus erat
de argento purissimo, plenus gemmis ex omni parte, qui talem
superscriptionem habebat: "Qui me elegerit, in me invenerit
quod natura dedit." Iste cophinus terra plenus erat. Tertius
cophinus erat de plumbo habens superscriptionem talem: "Potius
eligo hic esse et requiescere, quam in thesauris regis
permanere." In cophino isto erat tres anuli pretiosi. Tunc
ait imperator puellae: "Carissima, hic sunt tres cophini;
eligas quemcumque volueris; et si bene elegeris, filium meum
in maritum obtinebis."
-->
 He immediately had three caskets made.  The first was of pure
 gold and costly stones.  And there was such an inscription
 upon the casket: "He who opens me, will find in me that which
 he deserves."  And the whole casket was filled with the bones
 of the dead.  The second was of pure silver, studded with gems
 from every part of the world, and which had this inscription:
 "He who chooses me, will find in me that which nature gives."
 This casket was filled with dirt.  The third casket was of
 lead, having this inscription: "I choose to be here and to
 rest, rather than to remain in the king's treasury."  In this
 casket were three precious rings.  Then the emperor said to
 the maiden: "Dearest, here are three caskets; choose
 whichever one you will; and if you choose well, you will get
 my son in marriage."

<!--
Illa vero tres cophinos intime respexit et ait in corde
suo: "Deus, qui omnia videt, det mihi gratiam sic eligendi ut
de illo pro quo multum laboravi non deficiam." Quae primum
cophinum tetigit et scripturam legit: "Qui me," etc. Illa
cogitabat: "Cophinus exterius est pretiosus, sed quid interius
lateat penitus ignoro, ideo eum eligere nolo." Deinde secundum
legit, etc.  Quae ait: "Numquam natura dedit quod filia
patris mei deberet copulari filio imperatoris. Et ideo,"
etc. Tertium cophinum legit dicens: "Melius est mihi cum filio
regis requiescere quam in thesauris patris mei." Et alta 
voce clamabat: "Istum cophinum tertium eligo." Imperator cum
audisset, ait: "0 bona puella, satis prudenter elegisti. In
isto cophino sunt tres anuli mei pretiosi; unum pro me, unum
pro filio, tertium pro te in signum desponsationis." Statim
fecit nuptias celebrare, et tradidit ei filium suum, et sic in
pace vitam finierunt.
-->
 Indeed she closely considered the three caskets and said in
 her heart: "May God, who sees all, give me such grace to
 choose so that I might not fail of that for which I have
 worked so hard."  And she touched the first casket and read
 the writing: "He who," etc.  She thought: "The casket is
 outwardly precious, but I know not what might be hidden
 within it, likewise I am unwilling to choose it."  Next she
 read the second.  And she said: "Never did nature give that
 my father's daughter ought to be joined to the emperor's
 son." And likewise, etc.  The third casket she read, saying:
 "It is better to me to rest with the son of a king than in my
 father's treasury."  And in a loud voice she cried: "I choose
 this third casket."  The emperor, when he heard, said: "O
 noble maiden, you have chosen wisely enough.  In this casket
 are my three precious rings; one for me, one for my son, and
 the third for you in a sign of betrothal."  He had the
 nuptials celebrated at once, and delivered his son to her,
 and so they finished their lives in peace.

Moralitas. Carissimi, imperator est Deus, qui diu guerram cum
homine habuit in tantum quod tota natura humana erat destructa
per peccatum. Modo trewgae nobis datae sunt per Dominum, id
est, Christum. Filia quae filio imperatoris debet desponsari
est anima. Oportet ergo ut navis paretur pro ea cum nuntiis,
id est, corpus in quo anima residet cum quinque sansibus et
ceteris, nautae sunt ratio, voluntas, etc. Sed oportet per
mare, id est, per mundum, transire. Cete grande est diabolus,
contra quem debemus vigilare. Sed si nos contingit dormire in
peccatis deglutiet corpus et animam.
-->
 The moral.  Dearly beloved, the emperor is God who has long
 waged war with mankind, in so much as the entire human nature
 was destroyed through sin.  In this way the truce was sent to
 us through the Lord, that is, Christ.  The daughter, who was
 destined to be betrothed to the son of the emperor, is the
 soul.  Therefore it is right for the ship to be prepared for
 her with messengers, that is, the body in which the soul
 resides with the five senses and so forth, the sailors are
 reason, will, etc.  But it is fit to cross the sea, that is,
 the world.  The great whale is the devil, against whom we
 need to be vigilant.  But if it befalls us to fall asleep
 in our sins then he wil swallow us, body and soul.

<!--
Fac ergo, sicut fecit puella; ignem devotionis accende et eum
cum instrumentis, id est, bonis operibus percute, donec
recedat et potestatem suam contra te amittat. Tunc servi
militis, id est, praedicatores et confessores, habent eum
percutere, donec puella, id est, anima, ab eorum potestate
exeat et ad curiam Dei veniat. Sed est sciendum quod tres
cophini ei praesentantur.
-->
 And so, do as the maiden did; light the fire of devotion and
 strike with tools, that is, good works, until he withdraws
 and lets slip his power over you.  Then serve the soldiers,
 that is, the preachers and confessors, who have to strike
 him, until the maiden, that is, the soul, leaves his power
 and comes to the court of God.  But we must understand what
 the three caskets represent to her.

<!--
Per primum cophinum potentes ac divites intelleguntur, qui
habent talem superscriptionem: "Qui me," etc., id est, quando
anima a corpore separetur, nihil in me Deus inveniet nisi
peccata quae merui, quod est dolendum; vae qui hunc
eligit. Per secundum intellegitur mundi sapientes, quorum
eloquia splendunt sicut argentum et intus pleni sunt terrenis,
cum tali superscriptione: "Qui me elegerit," etc. Natura
semper appetit animae contrarium et illi non maritantur
Christo. Per tertium cophinum designantur boni christiani, qui
sunt plumbei, id est, quod non curant de aliquo mundano; in
quibus sunt tres anuli, scilicet, fides, spes et caritas; qui
istos eligit, filium Dei habere potest libentius quam in
thesauro mundano permanere. Studeamus.
-->
 From the first casket we can understand the power and riches
 that have such an inscription, that is, when the body and
 soul are divided, God finds nothing in me but the sins that I
 have earned, at which we must suffer; woe to those who choose
 this one.  From the second it is understood the sages of the
 world, whose speeches glitter like silver and on the inside
 are filled with earthly matters, with such an inscription:
 "He who chooses me," etc.  Nature always seeks after the
 soul's opposite and those are not wed to Christ.  From the
 third casket are choosen good christians, who are made of
 lead, that is, that they do not worry about any worldly
 thing; in which are three rings, of course, faith, hope and
 charity; he who chooses these, can have the son of God more
 gladly than to remain in the treasury of the world.  Let us
 so strive.
