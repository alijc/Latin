<h4>The Three Caskets</h4>

<p>
<!--
Honorius regnavit, dives valde, qui unicum filium habebat,
quem multum dilexit. Fama eius imperatoris per mundum volabat
quod in omnibus probus erat et iustus. Tamen contra unum regem
guerram habebat et eum devastabat. Rex iste cum multas
persecutiones ac damna infinita ab eo sustinebat tandem
cogitabat: "Tantum unicam filiam habeo et adversarius meus
unicum filium. Si per aliquam viam filiam meam possem
filio suo in matrimonium copulare pacem perpetuam obtinerem."
-->
 Honorius reigned, immensely rich, and had only one son, whom
 he loved greatly.  The fame of this emperor flew throughout the
 world, because he was honest and just in all things.  But he
 waged a war against a king and devastated him.  After thiat
 king sustained many attacks and unlimited damage from him, he
 finally thought: "I have only one daughter and my enemy only
 one son. If I could somehow join my daughter to his son I
 would obtain everlasting peace."

<!--
Misit sollemnes nuntios ad imperatorem ut saltem ei trewgam ad
tempus concederet quod cum eo personaliter loqui
posset. Imperator habito consilio trewgam unius anni
concessit. Rex vero personaliter ad eum accessit et filiam
eius filio suo obtulit. At iste: "Non faciam nisi duo
habeam. Primo ut tua filia sit virgo; secundo ut post decessum
tuum totum regnum tuum filio meo destinetur." At ille: "Bene
placet mihi." Statim de conventione charta sigillata est. Rex
vale imperatori fecit.
-->
 He sent distinguished messengers to the emperor to ask him to
 grant at least a temporary truce so that he might speak with
 him in person.  The emperor took counsel and granted a one
 year's truce.  Indeed the king came to him in person and
 offered his own daughter for the other's son.  But the
 emperor said: "I will not do this unless I have two things.
 First, your daughter must be a virgin; Second, after your
 death your entire kingdom must be settled on my son."  And
 the king said: "This pleases me well." A charter for the
 contract was sealed at once.  The king bade the emperor
 farewell.

<!--
Cum autem ad regnum suum venerat navem parari fecit quia
oporteret ut filia sua per mare ad imperatorem
transiret. Facta nave et omnibus necessariis paratis, puella
intravit habens thesaurum secum in magna copia ac milites
quinque cum dominabus et ancillis. Cum autem per mare
navigarent cete grandis ei occurrebat in mare et navem
deglutire volebat. Nautae hoc percipientes timuerunt valde et
praecipue puella. Nautae vero ignem copiosum fecerunt et die
ac nocte vigilabant. Sed accidit post triduum quod, fessi
propter magnas vigilias, dormierunt. Cete subito navem cum
omnibus contentis deglutivit. Puella cum intellexit quod in
ventre ceti esset fortiter clamabat. Ad cuius clamorem omnes
excitati sunt.

 Now when he had come to his own kingdom, he had a ship
 readied for the purpose of carrying his daughter across the
 sea to the emperor.  When the ship was ready and every needed
 prepared, the maiden boarded with her rich dowery and five
 soldiers with ladies and maids.  But while they were sailing
 across the sea a great whale rushed to meet them and tried to
 swallow the ship.  When they saw this the sailors trembled
 with fear.  And the maiden even more so.  Indeed the sailors
 made a huge fire and stood guard day and night.  But it fell
 out after three days that, exhausted from their vigil, they
 fell asleep.  The whale suddenly swallowed the ship with all
 of its contents.  The girl, when she understood that she was
 in the belly of a whale, cried out loudly.  And the others
 were awoken by her cries.

<!--
Nautae vero puellae dixerunt ac militibus:
"Carissimi, estote confortati, Deus nos salvabit; habeamus
bonum consilium quia sumus in ventre ceti." Ait puella:
"Audite consilium meum et erimus salvati." Qui dixerunt:
"Dic." Quae ait: "Accendamus ignem in magna copia et cete
quilibet vulneret sicut profundius possit et per ista duo
mortem recipiet et statim ad terram natabit et sic per gratiam
Dei evadere poterimus." Illi vero consilium puellae per omnia
impleverunt. Cete cum mortem sensit ad terram perrexit.
-->
 Indeed the sailors said to the maiden and the soldiers:
 "Dearest ones, take courage, God will save us; let us take
 good counsel for we are in the belly of a whale." The maiden
 said: "Listen to my counsel and we will be saved."  And they
 said: "Tell us."  She said: "Let's light a large fire, and
 have someone injure the whale as deeply as possible and by
 these two things it will receive its death-blow and will at
 once float to land, and so by God's grace we will escape."
 Indeed they fulfilled the maiden's advice in every way.  The
 whale sensed its death and beached itself.
