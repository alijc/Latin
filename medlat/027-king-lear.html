<h4>King Lear</h4>

<p>
<!--
Theodosius in civitate 1 Romana regnavit, prudens valde et
potens, qui tres filias pulchras habebat, dixitque filiae
seniori: "Quantum diligis me?" At illa: "Certe plus quam me
ipsam."  Ait ei pater: "Et te ad magnas divitias promovebo."
Statim ipsam dedit uni regi opulento et potenti in uxorem. Post
haec venit ad secundam filiam et ait ei: "Quantum diligis me?"
At illa: "Tantum sicut me ipsam." Imperator vero eam cuidam
duci tradidit in uxorem. Et post haec venit ad tertiam filiam
et ait ei: "Quantum me diligis?" At illa: "Tantum sicut vales,
et non plus neque minus." Ait ei pater: "Ex quo ita est, non ita
opulenter ero maritare sicut et sorores tuae"; tradidit eam
cuidam comiti in uxorem.

 Theodosius reigned in the city of Rome, very prudent and
 powerful, and had three beautiful daughters. He said to the
 eldest daughter: "How much do you love me?"  And she replied:
 "Surely more than I myself."  And her father told her: "And I
 will advance you to great wealth."  He immediately gave her to
 a rich and powerful king in marriage.  After that he came to
 the second daughter and said to her: "How much do you love me?"
 And she replied: "As much as I myself."  Indeed the emperor
 handed her over to a certain duke in matrimony. And after this
 he came to the third daughter and said to her: "How much do you
 love me?"  And she replied: "As much as you are due, and no
 more or less."  Her father said to her: "Because of this, I
 will not marry you off as richly as your sisters"; and he gave
 her in marriage to a count.

<!--
Accidit cito post haec quod imperator bellum contra regem
Aegypti habebat. Rex vero imperatorem de imperio fugabat unde
bonum refugii habere non poterat. Scripsit litteras anulo
suo signatas ad primam filiam suam, quae dixit quod patrem suum
plus quam se ipsam dilexit, ut ei succurreret in sua necessitate
eo quod de imperio expulsus erat. Filia, cum has litteras eius
legisset, viro suo regi casum primo narrabat.  Ait rex: "Bonum
est ut succurramus ei in hac sua magna necessitate. Colligam
exercitum et cum toto posse meo adiuvabo eum." Ait illa:
"Istud non potest fieri sine magnis expensis. Sufficit quod ei
concedatis, quamdiu est extra imperium suum, quinque milites qui
ei associentur." Et sic factum est.

 It happened soon after this that the emperor was waging a war
 against the king of Egypt.  Indeed the king chased the emperor
 out of his empire, and he could find no good refuge.  He wrote
 a letter, sealed with his ring, to his first daughter, and told
 her to succur in his need her father, whom she loved more than
 herself, because he had been driven out of his empire.  The
 daughter, when she had read the letter, first related this
 downfall to her husband, the king.  The king said: "It is good
 for us to succur him in this his great need.  I will collect an
 army and with all my power I will aid him."  She said: "It
 cannot be done without great expense.  It is enough if you
 allow him, so long as he is outside of his empire, five
 soldiers to attend him." And so it was done.

<!--
Filia patri rescripsit quod alium auxilium ab ea habere non
posset, nisi quinque milites de sumptibus regis in societate
sua. Imperator cum hoc audisset contristatus est valde et infra
se dicebat: "Heu mihi, tota spes mea erat in seniore filia mea 
eo quod dixit quod plus me dilexit quam se ipsam, et propter
hoc ad magnam dignitatem ipsam promovi."
-->
 The daughter wrote back to her father that he could have no
 other help from her, save five soldiers for his retinue, at the
 king's expense.  When the emperor had heard this he was greatly
 saddened and said to himself: "Woe is me, all of my hope was in
 my elder daughter because she said that she loved me more than
 herself, and on account of that I advanced her to a great
 position."

<!--
Scripsit statim secundae filiae, quae dixit: "Tantum te diligo
quantum me ipsam," quod succurreret ei in tanta necessitate. At
illa, cum audisset, viro suo denuntiabat 8 et ipsi consiliavit
ut nihil aliud ei concederet nisi victum et vestitum quamdiu
viveret honeste pro tali rege, et super hoc litteras patri suo
rescripsit. Imperator cum hoc audisset contristatus est valde
dicens: "Deceptus sum per duas filias. Iam temptabo tertiam quae
mihi dixit: 'Tantum te diligo quantum vales.'" Litteras scripsit
ei ut ei succurreret in tanta necessitate et quomodo sorores
suae ei respondebant.
-->
 He wrote to the second daughter at once, who had said: "As I
 love you more than I myself," to succur him in such need.  But
 she, when she had heard it, announced it to her husband and
 advised him to grant him nothing, other than provisions and
 clothing for so long as he might live honorably for such a
 king, and upon this wrote a letter back to her father.  The
 emperor, when he had heard this, sorrowed deeply, saying: "I
 have been deceived by both my daughters.  I will even try the
 third daughter, who told me: 'I love you as much as you are
 due.'" He wrote a letter to her, for her to succur her in such
 need, and how her sisters had answered him.

<!--
Tertia filia cum vidisset inopiam patris sui ad virum suum
dixit: "Domine mi reverende, mihi succurre in hac necessitate.
Iam pater meus expulsus est ab hereditate sua." Ait ei vir
eius: "Quid vis tu ut ei faciam?" At illa: "Exercitum colligas
et ad debellandum inimicum suum pergas cum eo." Ait comes:
"Voluntatem tuam adimplebo." Statim collegit magnum exercitum
et sumptibus suis propriis cum imperatore perrexit ad
bellum. Victoriam obtinuit et imperatorem in imperio suo posuit.
-->
 After the third daughter saw her father's need, she said to her
 husband: "My honored lord, succur me in this need.  My father
 has already been driven out of his inheritance." Her husband
 said to her: "What do you want me to do?" And she said:
 "collect and army and go on to vanquish his foe."  The count
 said: "I will carry out your will."  He collected a great army
 at once and at his own expense went to war beside the emperor.
 He obtained a victory and set the emperor back into power.

<!--

Tunc ait imperator: "Benedicta hora in qua genui filiam meam
iuniorem. Ipsam minus aliis filiabus dilexi et mihi in magna
necessitate succurrit et aliae filiae meae defecerunt, propter
quod totum imperium relinquero post decessum meum filiae meae
iuniori," et sic factum est. Post decessum patris filia iunior
regnavit et in pace vitam finivit.  

-->
 Then the emperor said: "Blessed was the hour in which I sired
 my youngest daughter. I loved her less than my other daughters
 and she succurred me in my great need and my other daughters
 let me down.  On account of this I will leave my whole empire,
 after my death, to my youngest daughter," and so it was done.
 After the death of her father the youngest daughter reigned and
 ended her life in peace.

Moraliter. Carissimi, iste imperator potest diei quilibet
homo mundanus qui habet tres filias. Prima filia, quae dicit:
"Diligo patrem plus quam me ipsam," certe est mundus iste, quem
homo tantum diligit, quod vitam suam circa 13 mundana expendit,
sed quando est in necessitate mortis tunc mundus vix cum 14 omni
dilectione 15 quam habuit concedet ei quinque milites, id est,
quinque tabulas ad modum cistae ad involvendum corpus
suum. Secunda filia, quae tantum diligit patrem sicut se ipsam,
est uxor tua, filii tui et parentes, qui inveniunt necessaria
quousque in terram positus fueris et nihil aliud.  Tertia filia
quae dicebat: "Tantum te diligo quantum vales," est Deus, quem
nimis 16 parum 16 diligimus. Sed si ad eum venerimus in
necessitate puro corde et munda mente sine dubio eius auxilium
obtinebimus contra regem Aegypti, id est, contra diabolum, et
ponet nos in nostram hereditatem, scilicet in regnum caeleste,
etc.
