<!--XXVII De Mulierum Subtili Deceptione-->
<h4>The Subtle Deciption of a Woman</h4>

<p>
<!--
Darius regnavit prudens valde, qui tres filios habuit quos
multum dilexit. Cum vero mori deberet totam hereditatem
primogenito legavit; secundo filio dedit omnia quae in
tempore suo acquisivit; tertio filio, scilicet minori,
tria iocalia pretiosa dedit, scilicet anulum aureum,
monile et pannum pretiosum. Anulus illam virtutem habuit
quod qui ipsum in digito gestabat gratiam omnium habuit,
in tantum quod, quicquid ab eis peteret, obtineret; monile
illam virtutem habuit quod qui eum in pectore portabat,
quicquid cor suum desiderabat quod possibile esset,
obtineret.  Pannus illam virtutem habuit quod, quicumque
super eum sederet et intra se cogitaret ubicumque esse
vellet, subito ibi esset.

 Once upon a time Darius reigned.  He was highly learned,
 and loved his three sons intensely.  Indeed, when he was
 about to die he bequeathed his entire inheritance to the
 first-born; to the second he gave everything that he had
 acquired in his lifetime; and to the third, the youngest
 of course, he gave three costly possesions - a gold ring,
 a necklace and a costly rug.  The ring had the virtue
 that whoever wore it on their finger had the goodwill of
 all men, so much so, that whatsoever they might ask of
 them, they would gain; the necklace had the virtue that
 whoever carried it on their breast, whatever their heart
 desired that might be possible, they would gain.  The rug
 had the virtue that, whoever might sit upon it and think
 to themselves wherever they wished to be, they would
 suddenly be there.

<!--
Ista tria iocalia dedit filio suo iuniori ut ad studium
pergeret et mater ea custodiret et tempore opportuno ei
daret; statimque rex spiritum emisit, qui honorifice
est sepultus. Duo primi filii eius legata occupabant,
tertius filius anulum a matre recepit ut ad studium
pergeret; cui mater dixit: "Fili, scientiam acquire et a
muliere caveas ne forte anulum perdas." Ionathas anulum
accepit, ad studium accessit et in scientia profecit.
-->
 He gave these three possessions to his youngest son so
 that he could proceed with his studies and that his
 mother should watch over them and give them to him at an
 opportune time; and at once the king gave up the ghost,
 and was honorably buried.  His first two sons seized
 their legacies, while the third son recieved the ring
 from his mother so that he might continue with his
 studies.  And his mother said to him: "Son, gain
 learning, and may you avoid a woman, and not by chance
 lose the ring."  Jonathan accepted the ring, undertook
 his studies and became accomplished in learning.

<!--
Post hoc cito quadam die in platea ei quaedam puella
occurrebat satis formosa et, captus eius amore, eam secum
duxit; continuo anulo utebatur et gratiam omnium habuit et
quicquid ab eis voluit habere obtinuit. Puella eius
concubina mirabatur quod tam laute viveret cum tamen
pecuniam non haberet; rationem quadam vice, cum laetus
esset, quaesivit, dicens quod creatura* sub caelo non
esset quam magis diligeret; ideo sibi dicere
deberet. Ille, de malitia non praemeditatus sibi, dixit
virtutem anuli esse talem, etc.
-->
 Soon after this there came a day that he met a young
 woman in the high street.  She was pretty enough and,
 seized with love, he led her away with him. He constantly
 made use of the ring and had all goodwill and whatsoever
 he wished to have of them he gained.  The young woman,
 now his concubine, marvelled that he lived so sumptuously
 when he didn't have any money; and one day, when he was
 in a good mood, she asked how it was, saying that there
 was no creature under heaven who loved him more; and
 therefore he should tell her.  He, not considering malice
 towards himself, told her that virtue of the ring was
 such, etc.


<!--
At illa: "Cum singulis diebus cum hominibus conversare
soles, perdere posses; ideo custodiam tibi eum fideliter."
Qui tradidit ei anulum, sed cum repeteret, penuria ductus,
illa alta voce clamavit quod fures abstulissent; qui motus
flevit amare, quia unde viveret non habuit. Qui statim
ad reginam, matrem suam, est reversus denuntians ei anulum
perditum. At illa: "Fili mi, tibi praedixi ut a muliere te
caveres; ecce tibi iam trado monile quod diligentius
custodias; si perdideris, honore et commodo perpetuo
carebis."  Ionathas monile recepit et ad idem studium est
reversus, et ecce concubina eius in porta civitatis
occurrit et cum gaudio eum recepit; ille, ut prius,
convivia multa habuit et laute vixit.
-->
 But she said: "You are wont to keep company with men
 every day, you might lose it; therefore I will faithfully
 guard it for you."  And he handed over the ring, but when
 he returned, led by want, she cried out in a loud voice
 that theives had carried it off; and he was agitated and
 wept bitterly, for he didn't have the wherewithall to
 live on. And he returned at once to his mother the queen,
 and announced the loss of the ring to her.  But she said:
 "My son, I warned you to beware a woman.  Look, I am now
 handing over to you the necklace that you must guard
 carefully; if you were to lose it, then you will lose
 honor and profit forever."  Jonathan accepted the
 necklace and returned to his studies, and lo his
 concubine met him at the gate of the city and received
 him joyfully; and he, as before, had great banquets and
 lived sumptuously.

<!--
Concubina mirabatur quia nec aurum nec argentum videbat, et
cogitabat quod aliud iocale apportasset, quod sagaciter ab
eo indagavit; qui ei monile ostendit et virtutem eius dixit.
Quae ait: "Semper monile tecum portas; una hora tantum
cogitare posses quod per annum sufficeret tibi; ideo trade
mihi ad custodiendum."
-->
 The concubine marveled, for she saw neither gold nor silver, and
 reflected that he had brought another possession, which she
 shrewdly dug out from him; and he showed her the necklace and
 told her of its virtue.  And she said: "You always carry the
 necklace with you; a single hour is enough for you to imagine
 what would suffice you for a year; therefore hand it over to me
 for safekeeping."

<!--
At ille: "Timeo quod sicut anulum perdidisti sic perderes monile
et sic damnum maximum incurrerem."
-->
 But he said:  "I'm afraid that, just as you lost the ring, so
 might you lose the necklace, and so I would incur a very great
 loss."

<!--
Quae ait: "O domine, iam per anulum scientiam acquisivi; unde
tibi fideliter promitto quod sic custodiam monile quod nullus
posset a me auferre."
-->
 And she said: "O lord, I have already gotten experience from
 the ring; from which I faithfully promise you that I will guard
 the ring so well that no one could carry it away from me."

<!--
Ille credens dictis eius, monile ei tradidit. Postquam omnia
consumpta fuissent monile petiit; ilia, sicut prius, iuravit quod
furtive ablatum esset. Quod audiens Ionathas flevit amare et ait:
"Nonne sensum perdidi quod post anulum perditum monile tibi
tradidi!"
-->
  Believing in her words, he handed the necklace over to her.
  After everything had been used up he asked for the necklace;
  but she, as before, swore that it had been furtively stolen
  away. On hearing this Jonathan wept bitterly and said: "Surely
  I have not lost the thought that, after losing the ring, I gave
  you the necklace!"

<!--
Perrexit ad matrem et ei totum processum nuntiavit; illa non
modicum dolens dixit: "O fili carissime, quare spem posuisti in
muliere? Iam altera vice deceptus es per eam et ab omnibus ut
stultus reputaris; ammodo sapientiam addiscas quia nihil habeo
tibi nisi pannum pretiosum quem pater tuus tibi dedit, et si
illum perdideris, ad me amplius redire non valeas."
-->
 He proceeded to his mother and reported to her the entire course
 of events. She, grieving not a little, said: "O my dearest son,
 why have you put your hope in a women?  You have already been
 cheated in another exchange with her and are thought to be
 foolish by everyone; henceforth you should learn wisdom, for I
 have nothing else for you except the costly length of cloth that
 your father gave you, and if you lose that, it will not avail
 you to come back to me."

<!--
Ille pannum recepit et ad studium perrexit et concubina eius, ut
prius, gaudenter eum recepit.  Qui expandens pannum dixit:
"Carissima, istum pannum dedit mihi pater meus," et ambo
posuerunt se super pannum.
-->
 He accepted this length of cloth and went on to his studies and
 his concubine, as before, received him with joy.  And he,
 spreading out the cloth, said: "Dearest love, my father gave me
 this cloth," and they both sat down upon the cloth.

<!--
Ionathas intra se cogitabat: "Utinam essemus in tantam
distantiam ubi nullus hominum ante venit!" Et sic factum
est; fuerunt enim in fine mundi in una foresta quae multum
distabat ab hominibus. Illa tristabatur et Ionathas votum
vovit Deo caeli quod dimitteret eam bestiis ad devorandum
donec redderet anulum et monile; quae promisit facere si
posset, et ad petitionem concubinae Ionathas virtutem panni
dixit, scilicet, quicumque super eo quiesceret et cogitaret ubi
esse vellet, ibi statim esset.
-->
 Jonathan thought to himself: "If only we were so far away
 that no man had been there before!" And so it happened; for
 they were at the end of the world in a forest which was far away
 from men.  She was grieved, and Jonathan made a vow to God in heaven
 that he would leave her to be devoured by wild animals unless
 she restored the ring and the necklace.  She promised to do this
 if she could, and Jonathan spoke of the virtue of the cloth,
 namely, that whoever sat on it and thought where they wished to
 go, there they were at once.
