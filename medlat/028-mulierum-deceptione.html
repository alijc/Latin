<!--XXVII De Mulierum Subtili Deceptione-->
<h4>The Subtle Deciption of a Woman</h4>

<!--
Darius regnavit prudens valde, qui tres filios habuit quos
multum dilexit. Cum vero mori deberet totam hereditatem
primogenito legavit; secundo filio dedit omnia quae in
tempore suo acquisivit; tertio filio, scilicet minori,
tria iocalia pretiosa dedit, scilicet anulum aureum,
monile et pannum pretiosum. Anulus illam virtutem habuit
quod qui ipsum in digito gestabat gratiam omnium habuit,
in tantum quod, quicquid ab eis peteret, obtineret; monile
illam virtutem habuit quod qui eum in pectore portabat,
quicquid cor suum desiderabat quod possibile esset,
obtineret.  Pannus illam virtutem habuit quod, quicumque
super eum sederet et intra se cogitaret ubicumque esse
vellet, subito ibi esset.

 Once upon a time Darius reigned.  He was highly learned,
 and loved his three sons intensely.  Indeed, when he was
 about to die he bequeathed his entire inheritance to the
 first-born; to the second he gave everything that he had
 acquired in his lifetime; and to the third, the youngest
 of course, he gave three costly possesions - a gold ring,
 a necklace and a costly rug.  The ring had the virtue
 that whoever wore it on their finger had the goodwill of
 all men, so much so, that whatsoever they might ask of
 them, they would gain; the necklace had the virtue that
 whoever carried it on their breast, whatever their heart
 desired that might be possible, they would gain.  The rug
 had the virtue that, whoever might sit upon it and think
 to themselves wherever they wished to be, they would
 suddenly be there.

<!--
Ista tria iocalia dedit filio suo iuniori ut ad studium
pergeret et mater ea custodiret et tempore opportuno ei
daret; statimque rex spiritum emisit, qui honorifice
est sepultus. Duo primi filii eius legata occupabant,
tertius filius anulum a matre recepit ut ad studium
pergeret; cui mater dixit: "Fili, scientiam acquire et a
muliere caveas ne forte anulum perdas." Ionathas anulum
accepit, ad studium accessit et in scientia profecit.

 He gave these three possessions to his youngest son so
 that he could proceed with his studies and that his
 mother should watch over them and give them to him at an
 opportune time; and at once the king gave up the ghost,
 and was honorably buried.  His first two sons seized
 their legacies, while the third son recieved the ring
 from his mother so that he might continue with his
 studies.  And his mother said to him: "Son, gain
 learning, and may you avoid a woman, and not by chance
 lose the ring."  Jonothan accepted the ring, undertook
 his studies and became accomplished in learning.

<!--
Post hoc cito quadam die in platea ei quaedam puella
occurrebat satis formosa et, captus eius amore, eam secum
duxit; continuo anulo utebatur et gratiam omnium habuit et
quicquid ab eis voluit habere obtinuit. Puella eius
concubina mirabatur quod tam laute viveret cum tamen
pecuniam non haberet; rationem quadam vice, cum laetus
esset, quaesivit, dicens quod creatura* sub caelo non
esset quam magis diligeret; ideo sibi dicere
deberet. Ille, de malitia non praemeditatus sibi, dixit
virtutem anuli esse talem, etc.
-->
 Soon after this there came a day that he met a young
 woman in the high street.  She was pretty enough and,
 seized with love, he led her away with him. He constantly
 made use of the ring and had all goodwill and whatsoever
 he wished to have of them he gained.  The young woman,
 now his concubine, marvelled that he lived so sumptuously
 when he didn't have any money; and one day, when he was
 in a good mood, she asked how it was, saying that there
 was no creature under heaven who loved him more; and
 therefore he should tell her.  He, not considering malice
 towards himself, told her that virtue of the ring was
 such, etc.


<!--
At illa: "Cum singulis diebus cum hominibus conversare
soles, perdere posses; ideo custodiam tibi eum fideliter."
Qui tradidit ei anulum, sed cum repeteret, penuria ductus,
illa alta voce clamavit quod fures abstulissent; qui motus
flevit amare, quia unde viveret non habuit. Qui statim
ad reginam, matrem suam, est reversus denuntians ei anulum
perditum. At illa: "Fili mi, tibi praedixi ut a muliere te
caveres; ecce tibi iam trado monile quod diligentius
custodias; si perdideris, honore et commodo perpetuo
carebis."  Ionathas monile recepit et ad idem studium est
reversus, et ecce concubina eius in porta civitatis
occurrit et cum gaudio eum recepit; ille, ut prius,
convivia multa habuit et laute vixit.

 But she said: "You are wont to keep company with men
 every day, you might lose it; therefore I will faithfully
 guard it for you."  And he handed over the ring, but when
 he returned, led by want, she cried out in a loud voice
 that theives had carried it off; and he was agitated and
 wept bitterly, for he didn't have the wherewithall to
 live on. And he returned at once to his mother the queen,
 and announced the loss of the ring to her.  But she said:
 "My son, I warned you to beware a woman.  Look, I am now
 handing over to you the necklace that you must guard
 carefully; if you were to lose it, then you will lose
 honor and profit forever."  Jonothan accepted the
 necklace and returned to his studies, and lo his
 concubine met him at the gate of the city and received
 him joyfully; and he, as before, had great banquets and
 lived sumptuously.
