<!--XXIX De Homine et Uxore Litigiosa-->
<h4>A Man and his Quarrelsome Wife</h4>

<p>
<!--
Homo quidam habuit uxorem rebellem et contumacem, garrulam et
pertinacem. Contigit aliquando ut pariter ambularent in prato,
quod nuper dominus prati cum summa diligentia falcaverat, et ait
homo: "Quam diligenter et congrue falcatum est hoc pratum!"
"Mentiris," ait mulier, "quoniam forcipe praecisum est."
"Semper," inquit vir, "verbis meis contraria fuisti. Sed tamen hoc
vere scio quod pratum hoc vicinus meus falce demessuit."
"Deliras," ait mulier, "quia forcipe factum est hoc." "Secundum
consuetudinem tuam," inquit vir, "semper novissima vis retinere
verba," et deiciens illam incubuit super eam, et dixit: "Ego
linguae officium, qua semper proterva fuisti locuta, tibi impediam
nisi mihi consentias."  Et ait: "Quo instrumento praecisum est
pratum?" Quia igitur linguam eius arripuerat et fortiter premebat,
plena verba formare non poterat, sed "orhipe" pro forcipe
dixit. Tunc incepit linguam incidere, et quaesivit ut quaesierat
ante. Illa autem, quia iam linguam amiserat et loqui non potuit,
signo quo valuit pertinaciam ostendit, forcipis formam et officium
digitis ostentans. Sic vir mulieri linguam amputavit.

 There once was a man who had a wife who was rebellious and
 defiant, and garrulous and obstinate.  At length it fell out that
 they walked together in a meadow that had just been very
 carefully mown, and the man said: "How carefully and aptly has
 this meadow been mown with a sickle!"  "You lie", said the woman,
 "for it was cut with shears."  The man said, "You have always
 contradicted my words.  But nevertheless I surely know that my
 neighbor mowed this meadow with a sickle." "You rave," said the
 woman, "for this was done with shears."  "Following your habit,"
 said the man, "you always want to have the last word," and,
 throwing her down, he sat down upon her, and said: "I will forbid
 you the service of your tongue, by which you have always spoken
 recklessly, unless you agree with me."  And he said: "With which
 tool was the meadow mown?"  And so, since he had seized her
 tongue and pressed her down firmly, she could not form a complete
 word, but said 'ear' for shears.  Then he began to cut into her
 tongue, and asked what he had asked before.  But she, since she
 had already lost her tongue and could not speak, made a sign by
 which she persisted in her obstinacy, showing the form and
 function of shears with her fingers.  And so the man cut off his
 wife's tongue.

Moralitas: Sic litigiosi et contumaces iurgia sua semper malo fine
concludunt; malunt enim iniuste alios superare quam ipsi iuste
subiciantur.
-->

 Moral:  So your quarrelsome and defiant disputes always come to a
 bad end; for they prefer to overcome others unjustly than to
 subject themselves to justice.
