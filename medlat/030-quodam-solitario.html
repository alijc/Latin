<!--XXX De Quodam Solitario-->
<h4>A Certain Hermit</h4>

<p>
<!--
Fuit quidam solitarius habens duo colobia, unum in sollemnitatibus
et aliud cotidianum. Venit quidam pauper hiemis tempore quaerens
indumentum. Ille vero eduxit panem et dedit ei dicens: "Accipe
hoc, quia indumentum non habeo superfluum quod tibi donem." Pauper
vero non cessabat flere ac vociferare dicens: "Miserere mei."
Victus itaque monachus a prece pauperis, intrans cellam suam exuit
se cotidiano colobio et dedit pauperi; sibi autem retinuit
melius. Postea vero compunctus dixit pauperi: "Redde mihi quod
tibi dedi colobium et accipe hoc melius."

 There once was a hermit who had two cloaks, one for feast days
 and the other for everyday.  There came one winter a poor man,
 seeking clothing.  However, he held out a loaf of bread and gave
 it to him, saying.  "Take this, for I have no extra clothing to
 give you."  But the poor man kept on weeping and wailing, saying:
 "Have pity on me."  And so the monk, overcome by the poor man's
 entreaty, went into his cell and pulled off his everyday cloak
 and gave it to the poor man; but he keep the better one for
 himself.  But later, stricken with remorse, he said to the poor
 man: "Give me back the cloak that I gave you and take this better
 one."

Cum autem accepisset, induit se illud et abiens in civitatem
vendidit illud cuidam meretrici. Illa vero induens se illud venit
semel et bis ubi erat ille monachus. Ut autem vidit indumentum
suum, recognovit quia suum esset quo in sollemnitatibus
utebatur. Contristatus est valde et intrans cellam suam dixit:
"Vere quia non placuit Deo hoc quod feci nec recepit meam
devotionem, quoniam in talibus manibus venit pallium meum, quo
ego in diebus festis induebar et modo meretrix utitur eo."

 Now after the poor man had taken it, he put it on and, going out
 into the city, sold it to a certain prostitue.  And she put it on
 and came once and again to where that monk was.  Now when he saw
 his own clothing, he recognized it as the one that he used to
 wear on feast days.  He was most grieved and, going into his
 cell, said: "Truly, what I did did not please God, and he has not
 accepted my devotion, seeing that my cloak, which I used to wear
 on feast days, has come into such hands as these, and a mere
 prostitue wears it."

Prae tristitia vero non comedit die illa. Nocte vero cum
obdormisset vidit Dominum nostrum Iesum Christum indutum
vestimentum suum quod pauperi dedit et introeuntem in cellam suam
et dicentem sibi: "Frater, frater." Qui ut aspexit, vidit lucem
magnam dixitque: "Quis es, Domine?" Qui dixit ei: "Aspice in me."
Ut autem prospexit, dixit ei: "Cognoscis hoc?" Respondit: "Etiam,
Domine; colobium meum est." Ait illi: "Ego sum Iesus. Non iam
tristeris, sed gaude et laetare et age gratias Deo. Ex quo enim
illud dedisti pauperi, ego accepi." Et laetatus monachus valde in
benignitate Domini nostri Iesu Christi, qui non permisit eum
torqueri a cogitationibus, sed certificabat eum in verbo quod
ante praedixerat, quia "quod uni ex minimis meis fecistis, mihi
fecistis."

 Indeed, on account of his sorrow he did not eat that day.  But
 that night, when he fell asleep he saw our Lord Jesus Christ,
 clothed in the garment that he had given the poor man, who had
 entered his cell and said to him: "Brother, brother." And as he
 looked, he saw a great light and said: "Who are you, Lord?"  And
 he said to him: "Look at me." But as he stared, he said to him:
 "Do you recognize this?" He answered: "Even so, Lord: it is my
 cloak." He said to him: "I am Jesus. Sorrow no more, but rejoice
 and be of good cheer and give thanks to God.  For what you gave
 to the poor man, I have received." And the monk took great joy in
 the kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, who did not allow him to
 be tormented by his thoughts, but gave him assurance in his word
 what he had said before, that "what you have done for the least of
 mine, you have done for me."
