<!--XXXI De Quodam Iuvene-->
<h4>A Certain Young Man</h4>

<p>
<!--
Narravit abbas Iohannes, qui manebat in loco qui dicitur
Petra, de abbate Daniele Aegyptio dicens, quia cum ascendisset
senex in locum qui dicitur Terenuthi ut venderet opus manuum
suarum, iuvenis quidam accessit deprecans eum dicens: "Propter
Deum te rogo, pater, ut venias in domum meam et facias
orationem super uxorem meam, quia sterilis est." Senex autem
victus a prece iuvenis, eo quod per nomen Domini eum
adiuraverat, abiit cum eo. Et facta oratione super uxore eius
recessit et abiit in cellam suam.

 The abbot Johannes, who lived in a place called Petra, told a
 story about the abbot Daniel the Egyptian.  Namely, when the
 old man had climbed to the place called Terenouthis in order
 to sell his handiwork, a certain young man approached him and
 entreated him, saying: "For the sake of God I beg of you,
 father, that you come to my house and pray over my wife, for
 she is barren."  Now the old man was won over by the plea of
 the young man, because he had charged him by the name of the
 Lord, and went away with him.  And, after praying over the
 man's wife he returned and departed into his own cell.

Non post multum vero tempus concepit mulier. Quod ut viderunt
pravi homines Deum non timentes, detrahebant seni dicentes:
"Vere scimus quia iuvenis ingenerabilis est et non generat,
sed de abbate Daniele concepit mulier." Devenit autem haec
fama usque ad senem. Quod cum audisset, misit ad virum
mulieris dicens: "Cum genuerit uxor tua, notifica illud
mihi."

 And indeed, not long after that the woman conceived.  When
 corrupt men who did not fear God considered this, they
 disparaged the old man, saying: "Indeed we know that the
 young man is impotent and didn't father the child, but the
 woman conceived by the abbot Daniel."  Now this rumor reached
 as far as the old man.  When he had heard this, he sent to
 the wife's husband, saying: "When your wife gives birth,
 notify me about it."

Quando vero genuit mulier, nuntiatum est a iuvene abbati
Danieli in Cithi, quia cum Dei adiutorio et orationibus tuis
genuit mulier. Tunc abiit abbas Daniel dixitque iuveni: "Fac
prandium et invita omnes parentes et amicos tuos." Cum autem
omnes pranderent, accepit senex infantem in manibus suis et
coram omnibus dixit ei: "Quis est pater tuus, o infans?"
Dixit puer: "Iste est, domine mi," demonstrans iuvenem digito
manus suae. Erat enim puer dierum viginti quinque. Quod
videntes omnes qui aderant glorificaverunt Deum. Ex tunc
obstrusa 4 sunt labia loquentium iniqua, qui Dei homini
detraxerant.

 Indeed, when the woman gave birth, it was announced by the
 young man to Abbot Daniel in Cithia, that with the help of
 God and your prayers the woman had given birth.  Then the
 abbot Daniel went out and said to the young man: "Prepare a
 meal and invite all your friends and relatives."  Now when
 everyone was eating, the old man took the infant in his arms
 and in the presence of everyone said to him: "Who is your
 father, child?"  The boy said: "It is he, my lord," pointing
 out the young man with his finger.  Now the boy was
 twenty-five days old.  When they saw this everyone there
 glorified God.  From then on the unkind lips were thrust out
 in a pout when those who had disparaged the man of God were
 speaking.
