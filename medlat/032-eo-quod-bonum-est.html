<!--XXXII De Eo Quod Bonum Est Ponere in Deo Spem Suam-->
<h4>Why it is Good to Put Your Faith in God</h4>

<p>
<!--
Narravit nobis abbas Palladius dicens: "Senex quidam
saecularis deprehensus est in Alexandria in homicidio. Qui,
diutius extortus et maceratus suppliciis, dixit nequaquam se
fuisse solum in homicidio, sed socium habuisse quendam
iuvenem qui erat annorum circiter triginta.
-->
 Abbot Palladius talked to us, saying: "A certain worldly
 old man was arrested in Alexandria for a murder.  He,
 tortured for a long time and worn down by the punishment,
 said that he hadn't at all done the murder alone, but had
 had an accomplice - a certain young man who was around
 thirty years old.

"Multum autem utrique adflicti sunt a tortoribus. Dicebat
enim senex quia mecum fuit in homicidio; iuvenis autem
dicebat: 'Nequaquam.' Quid multa?  Post diversa tormenta
acceperunt utrique sententiam ut infurcarentur. Et
accipientes eos, milites una cum carnificibus deduxerunt
in eum locum qui dicitur Quinto. Ibi enim soliti erant
puniri qui huiusmodi noxae erant. Est enim in loco illo
templum Saturni desertum.
-->
 "Now both were greatly beaten by the torturers.  For the
 old man said that he was in with me on the murder; but the
 young man kept saying: 'No way.'  What more is there to
 say?  After several bouts of torture they each received the
 sentence of being hanged on the gallows.  And then the
 soldiers seized them and led them off, together with the
 executioners, to the place that is called Quinto.  For that
 is where they used to mete out punishment for that sort of
 crime. For a deserted temple of Saturn was in that place.

"Cum autem venissent omnes simul in loco milites cum
carnificibus, voluerunt iuvenem primum appendere in
ligno. Qui procidens ad pedes militum rogabat eos dicens:
'Propter Deum, domini mei, facite caritatem, ut contra
orientem faciatis me aspicere, cum appenderitis me.' Et
dixerunt: 'Quare?' Et dixit eis: 'Vere, domini mei, non
habeo nisi septem menses, ex quo sanctum baptismum
suscepi et factus sum christianus.' Senex autem indignans et
irridens verba iuvenis, ait: 'Me vero contra Serapin et
Saturnum facite aspicere.' Ut autem audierunt milites
blasphemiam senis, appenderunt ipsum primum.
-->
 "Now when they had all arrived together in the spot, the
 soldiers and the executioners wanted to hang the young man
 on the gallows first.  But he fell prostrate at the feet of
 the soldiers and begged them, saying: 'For the love of God,
 my lords, do me the kindness of having me face the east when
 you hang me.'  And they said: 'Why?'  And he told them:
 'Truly, my lords, it's been a mere seven months since I
 accepted holy baptism and became a christian.' But the old man,
 scorning and mocking the young man's words, said: 'Indeed,
 have me face Serapis and Saturn.' But when the soldiers
 heard the blasphemy of the old man, they hanged him first.

Providentia vero Dei usque dum ilium infurcarent, ecce
caballarius in festinantia missus ad milites ab Augustalio ut
senem quidem appenderent, iuvenem autem ad se reducerent.
Quod audientes milites gavisi sunt gaudio magno et qui ibi
stabant glorificaverunt Deum qui salvos facit sperantes in se.
Et reducentes ilium ad praetorium praesentaverunt Augustalio.
Quem ut vidit, dedit ei absolutionem et dimisit in pace. Iuvenis
autem abiit et factus est perfectissimus monachus." Haec vero
scripsimus ut sciant omnes quia novit Dominus iustos de
temptationibus eripere, impios autem servare ad diem tormentorum.
-->
 "Indeed, by the providence of God, while they were hanging
 that one, lo, a horseman was sent at a gallop to the
 soldiers from the governer, to order them to hang the old
 man, but bring back the young one.  When the soldiers heard
 this they rejoiced with great joy and stood there
 glorifying God, who brings about the salvation of those who
 trust in him.  And they returned him to the government
 house and presented him to the governer.  Who, when he saw
 him, gave him an acquittal and sent him away in peace.  Now
 the young man went away and became the most perfect monk."
 Indeed, we have written of these things in order that all
 might understand that the Lord knows how to rescue just men
 from temptations, but keep wicked ones for the day of
 torments.
