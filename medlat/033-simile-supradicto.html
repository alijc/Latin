<!--XXXIII Simile Supradicto-->
<h4>As Was Said Before</h4>

<p>
<!--
Idem abbas Palladius narravit nobis et hoc quod quidam amator
Christi fuerat habitans in Alexandria, valde religiosus et
elimosinator et susceptor pauperum atque monachorum, habens
uxorem fidelem et timentem Deum et ieiunantem cotidie;
habebant vero et unicam filiam annorum sex. Hic autem vir
quodam tempore voluit navigare in Constantinopolim; erat enim
negotiator. Et dimisit uxorem et filiam in domo cum servo uno.
Cum vero exiret a domo ut iret ad navem, dixit ei cum lacrimis
uxor sua: "Cui nos dimittis, domine mi?" At ille respondens
ait: "Dominatrici vestrae sanctae Dei genetrici et virgini
Mariae."

This same Abbot Palladius also related to us that a certain
lover of Christ once lived in Alexandria, intensely religious
and a giver of alms and a protector of both the poor and of
monks.  He had a wife who was faithful and who feared God and
fasted every day.  And they had a single daughter, six years
old.  Now one day this man wished to sail to Constantinople;
for he was a merchant.  And he left his wife and son at home
with a single servant.  And when he departed from his house to
go to the ship, his wife said to him with tears in her eyes:
"In whose care are you leaving us, my lord?"  And he replied,
saying: "In the care of your holy mistress, the mother of God
and virgin, Mary."

Una autem dierum cum sederet mulier una cum filia sua ut
operaretur opus suum, inspiratus a diabolo servus voluit
occidere matrem cum filia et tollere quicquid haberet in domo
et fugere. Tollens vero gladium a coquina ascendit in
triclinium, ubi erat mulier cum filia sua. Et cum
appropinquasset ad ianuam triclinii, statim percussus
caecitate nequissimus servus non valebat neque in triclinium
ascendere neque in coquinam descendere. Cum autem per unam
horam vim sibi faceret ut intraret et non valeret, coepit
vocare dominam suam ut iret ad eum. Illa autem coepit admirari
quomodo staret in medio ianuarum et non pergeret ad
ipsam. Dixitque ei: "Tu veni ad me; sic enim decet."
-->
One day, while the woman was sitting with her daughter to do
her work, the servant, possessed by the devil, wished to kill
the mother and her daughter and to steal whatever they had in
the house and flee.  So he took a sword and climbed up
from the kitchen to the dining room, where the mother and
daughter were.  And when he had drawn near to the door to the
dining room, this most wicked servant was struck blind, and
was helpless to either climb up to the dining room or to go
down to the kitchen.  But when, after an hour, he had gathered
up his strength to enter and could not, he began to call his
mistress to come to him.  But she fell to astonishment
about how he was standing in the middle of the doorway and did
not proceed to her.  And she told him: "You come to me; for
that's what is proper."

<!--
Nesciebat enim quia caecus effectus esset. Coepit vero servus
magis eam vocare et coniurare ut iret et appropinquaret
ei. Illa autem iuravit se nequaquam ire ad eum. Qui dixit:
"Saltem puellam mitte ad me." Cui respondit mulier: "Neque
puella veniet ad te neque ego. Iam dixi tibi, si vis venire,
veni; sin autem, sta illic."
-->
For she didn't realize that he had become blind.  Indeed the
servant began the more to call her and to implore her to come
and draw near to him.  But she swore that she would by no
means go to him.  And he said: "At least send the girl to me."
And the woman replied to him: "Neither the girl nor I will
come to you.  I already told you, if you want to come, then
come; but if not, then stay there."

<!--
Tunc vidit quia nihil valuit ex his quae cogitaverat facere,
arreptoque gladio transfixit viscera sua. Domina autem, ut
vidit quod fecerat in semetipsum nequissimus servus,
exclamavit. Quod audientes vicini concurrentes simul cum
praetorianis invenerunt eum semivivum et adhuc spirantem. Et
interrogantes eum pro quo hoc fecisset, confessus est
coram omnibus quae agere voluit; et tunc expiravit. Tunc
dederunt omnes laudem Deo qui salvavit matrem cum filia et
salvat omnes per auxilium sanctae genetricis suae. Amen.
-->
Then he saw that he availed nothing of the things that he had
intended to do, and seized the sword and stabbed himself in 
the guts.  But his mistress, when she saw that the wicked
servant had done to himself, cried out.  When the neighbors
heard this they came running, together with the guards, and
found him nearly dead but still breathing.  And when they asked
him why he had done this thing, he confessed before them all
what he had wanted to do; and then expired. Then everyone
praised God, who had saved the mother and daughter and who
saves everyong through the aid of his holy mother.  Amen.
