<p>
DE FAMILIARITATE MULIERUM PERICULOSA
</p>
<blockquote>
 On Perilous Familiarity with Women
</blockquote>

<p>
Narravit mihi quidam homo valde religiosus quod in partibus
in quibus commoratus fuerat accidit quod quaedam valde
religiosa et honesta matrona, frequenter veniens ad ecclesiam
die ac nocte, devotissime Domino serviebat. 
</p>
<blockquote>
 A certain intensely religious man told me that in the region
 in which he used to live it happened that a certain devout
 and honest matron used to serve the Lord with the greatest
 devotion, coming often to the church, day and night.
</blockquote>

<p>
Quidam autem monachus, custos et thesaurarius monasterii,
magnum nomen religionis habebat et revera ita erat.
</p>
<blockquote>
 Now a certain monk, the custodian and treasurer of the
 monastery, had a great name for piety and was in fact pious.
</blockquote>

<p>
Cum autem frequenter in ecclesia de iis quae pertinent ad
religionem mutuo loquerentur, diabolus invidens honestati et
famae eorum immisit eis vehementes temptationes, ita quod
amor spiritualis conversus est in carnalem, unde dixerunt
sibi et assignaverunt noctem in qua recederet monachus a
monasterio cum thesauro ecclesiae, et matrona a domo sua
cum summa pecuniae quam auferret clam marito.
</p>
<blockquote>
 But as they often talked between themselves in the church
 about those things that concern religion, the devil, envious
 of their honesty and reputation, sent powerful temptations
 upon them, so that their spiritial love was converted into
 carnal lust.  From this they spoke to each other and
 assigned a night for the monk to slip out of the monastery
 with the church treasury, and the matron from her house
 with as much money as she could carry off without her
 husband knowing.
</blockquote>

<p>
Cum autem sic discederent et fugerent, monachi surgentes ad matutinas
viderunt arcas fractas et thesaurum ecclesiae asportatum, et cum 
non invenirent monachum festinanter secuti sunt eum. 
</p>
<blockquote>
 Now after they so withdrew and fled, the monks, rising for
 matins, saw that the chests had been broken and the church
 treasury carried off, and since they couldn't find the monk
 they quickly followed him.
</blockquote>

<p>
Similiter maritus dictae mulieris, videns arcam suam apertam
et pecuniam ablatam, secutus est uxorem suam et,
apprehendentes monachum et mulierem cum thesauro, reduxerunt
eos et in arto carcere posuerunt.
</p>
<blockquote>
 Similarly, the husband of the aforesaid woman, seeing that
 his chest was open and the money removed, chased after his
 wife and, catching the monk and the woman with the treasury,
 brought them back and put them into a strong jail.

<p>
<!--
Tantum autem scandalum fuit per totam regionem et ita omnes infamabant
religiosas personas quod longe maius damnum fuit de infamia et
scandalo quam de ipso peccato.
</p> 
<blockquote>
-->
AJC Now there was such a great scandal through the whole district and
so everyone dishonored religious people, because there was a greater injury
from disgrace and scandal than from the sin itself.
</blockquote>

<p>
<!--
Tunc monachus ad se reversus, coepit cum multis lacrimis rogare
beatam Virginem, cui semper ab infantia servierat et nihil umquam tale
ei acciderat.
</p> 
<blockquote>
-->
AJC Then the monk came to himself, and began to pray, with many
tears, to the blessed Virgin, whom he had always served from infancy
and had never had anything like this happen to him.
</blockquote>

<p>
<!--
Similiter et dicta matrona coepit instanter auxilium beatae
Virginis implorare, quam frequenter diebus ac noctibus consueverat
salutare, et coram eius imaginem genua flectere.
</p> 
<blockquote>
-->
AJC And likewise the aforesaid matron began to urgently beg for help from the
Blessed Virgin, whom she had been often wont to greet, and to genuflect
before her statue.
</blockquote>

<p>
<!--
Tandem beata Virgo valde irata eis apparuit et, postquam eis multum
improperavit, ait: Ã¬Remissionem peccati possem vobis obtinere a filio
meo; sed quid possum facere de tanto scandalo?
</p> 
<blockquote>
-->
AJC Finally the intensely angry Blessed Virgin appeared to them and,
after she'd strongly reproached them, said: "Would that I could obtain
forgiveness of your sin from my Son: but what can I do about such a
scandal?" 
</blockquote>

<p>
<!--
Vos enim fetere fecistis nomen religiosarum personarum coram omni
populo, ita quod de cetero eis non credetur.
</p> 
<blockquote>
-->
AJC For you have made a stench for religious people before the
whole district, so that henceforth they won't be trusted.
</blockquote>

<p>
<!--
Hoc est enim quasi damnum irrecuperabile.
</p> 
<blockquote>
-->
AJC Indeed, this damage is like to be irreparable.
</blockquote>

<p>
<!--
Tandem orationibus eorum pia Virgo devicta, compulit daemones qui
haec procuraverant venire, iniungens eis quod, sicut religionem
infamaverant, ita infamiam cessare procurarent.
</p> 
<blockquote>
-->
AJC But in the end the pious Virgin, overcome by their prayers,
forced the demons that had managed this affair to appear, charging
them that, since they had defamed religion, therefore they should 
put an end to the infamy.
