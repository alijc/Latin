<!--XXXIV DE FAMILIARITATE MULIERUM PERICULOSA-->
<h4>On Perilous Familiarity with Women</h4>

<!--
Narravit mihi quidam homo valde religiosus quod in partibus
in quibus commoratus fuerat accidit quod quaedam valde
religiosa et honesta matrona, frequenter veniens ad ecclesiam
die ac nocte, devotissime Domino serviebat. 
-->
 A certain intensely religious man told me that in the region
 where he used to live it happened that a certain devout
 and honest matron served the Lord with the greatest
 devotion, coming to church often, day and night.

<!--
Quidam autem monachus, custos et thesaurarius monasterii,
magnum nomen religionis habebat et revera ita erat.
-->
 Now a certain monk, the custodian and treasurer of the
 monastery, had a great name for piety and was in fact pious.

<!--
Cum autem frequenter in ecclesia de iis quae pertinent ad
religionem mutuo loquerentur, diabolus invidens honestati et
famae eorum immisit eis vehementes temptationes, ita quod
amor spiritualis conversus est in carnalem, unde dixerunt
sibi et assignaverunt noctem in qua recederet monachus a
monasterio cum thesauro ecclesiae, et matrona a domo sua
cum summa pecuniae quam auferret clam marito.
-->
 But as they often talked between themselves in the church
 about those things that concern religion, the devil, envious
 of their honesty and reputation, sent powerful temptations
 upon them, so that their spiritial love was converted into
 carnal lust.  From this they spoke to each other and
 assigned a night for the monk to slip out of the monastery
 with the church treasury, and the matron from her house
 with as much money as she could carry off without her
 husband knowing.

<!--
Cum autem sic discederent et fugerent, monachi surgentes ad matutinas
viderunt arcas fractas et thesaurum ecclesiae asportatum, et cum 
non invenirent monachum festinanter secuti sunt eum. 
-->
 Now after they so withdrew and fled, the monks, rising for
 matins, saw that the chests had been broken and the church
 treasury carried off, and since they couldn't find the monk
 they quickly followed him.

<!--
Similiter maritus dictae mulieris, videns arcam suam apertam
et pecuniam ablatam, secutus est uxorem suam et,
apprehendentes monachum et mulierem cum thesauro, reduxerunt
eos et in arto carcere posuerunt.
-->
 Similarly, the husband of the aforesaid woman, seeing that
 his chest was open and the money removed, chased after his
 wife and, catching the monk and the woman with the treasury,
 brought them back and put them into a strong jail.

<!--
Tantum autem scandalum fuit per totam regionem et ita omnes infamabant
religiosas personas quod longe maius damnum fuit de infamia et
scandalo quam de ipso peccato.
--> 
 Now there was such a great scandal through the whole district and everyone
 dishonored religious people, so that there was a greater injury from the
 disgrace and scandal than from the sin itself.

<!--
Tunc monachus ad se reversus, coepit cum multis lacrimis rogare
beatam Virginem, cui semper ab infantia servierat et nihil umquam tale
ei acciderat.
--> 
 Then the monk came to his senses, and began to pray, with many tears, to the
 blessed Virgin, whom he had always served from infancy and had never had
 anything like this happen to him.

<!--
Similiter et dicta matrona coepit instanter auxilium beatae
Virginis implorare, quam frequenter diebus ac noctibus consueverat
salutare, et coram eius imaginem genua flectere.
--> 
 And likewise the aforesaid matron began to urgently beg for help
 from the Blessed Virgin (to whom she had been wont to pay her
 respects, day and night) and to genuflect before her statue.

<!--
Tandem beata Virgo valde irata eis apparuit et, postquam eis multum
improperavit, ait: "Remissionem peccati possem vobis obtinere a filio
meo; sed quid possum facere de tanto scandalo?"
--> 
 Finally the intensely angry Blessed Virgin appeared to them and,
 after she'd strongly reproached them, said: "I could obtain
 forgiveness of your sin from my Son: but what can I do about such
 a scandal?"

<!--
Vos enim fetere fecistis nomen religiosarum personarum coram omni
populo, ita quod de cetero eis non credetur.
--> 
 For you have made a stench for religious people before the whole
 district, so that henceforth they won't be trusted.

<!--
Hoc est enim quasi damnum irrecuperabile.
--> 
 Indeed, this damage is like to be irreparable.

<!--
Tandem orationibus eorum pia Virgo devicta, compulit daemones qui
haec procuraverant venire, iniungens eis quod, sicut religionem
infamaverant, ita infamiam cessare procurarent.
--> 
 But in the end the pious Virgin, overcome by their prayers,
 compelled the demons that had managed this affair to appear,
 charging them that, since they had defamed religion, they should
 therefore put an end to the infamy.

<!--
Illi vero, cum non possent eius imperiis resistere, post multas
anxietates et varias cogitationes reperta via quomodo cessaret
infamia, restituerunt nocte monachum in ecclesia et arcam fractam
sicut prius reparantes et in ea thesaurum reponentes, arcam etiam
quam matrona aperuerat clauserunt et serraverunt et pecuniam in
ea reposuerunt, et in camera sua in loco ubi orare solebat
mulierem posuerunt.
--> 
 And indeed, since they couldn't withstand her commands, they
 worked out (after great care and many changes of plan) a way to
 be free of the disgrace.  They restored the monk to his church
 in the night, restoring the broken chest to its previous state,
 and putting the treasure back into it. Likewise, they closed and
 locked the chest that the matron had opened and put the money
 back into it, and they put the woman in her room in the spot
 where she was wont to pray.

<!--
Cum autem monachi repperissent thesaurarium domus suae sicut
consueverat Dominum exorare, et maritus uxorem suam reperiret, et
thesaurum sicut prius fuerat repperissent, coeperunt obstupescere
et mirari, et currentes ad carcerem viderunt monachum et mulierem
in compedibus, sicut eos prius dimiserant.
-->
 Now when the monks discovered that their order's treasure was
 back in its usual place they worshiped the Lord.  And the
 husband found his wife, and they found their treasure just as it
 had been before.  They were struck dumb and commenced to marvel,
 and, running to the jail they saw the monk and the woman in
 shackles, just as they'd left them earlier.

<!-- 
Sic enim videbatur eis quia unus daemon transfiguravit se in
speciem monachi et alius in speciem mulieris.
-->
 In fact, what seemed so to them was that one demon had
 transformed himself into the likeness of the monk and another
 into the likeness of the woman.

<!--
Cum autem tota civitas ad videnda miracula convenisset daemones,
cunctis audientibus, dixerunt: "Recedamus; satis enim istis
illusimus et de religiosis personis mala cogitare fecimus."
-->
 Now when the whole town had come together to see the miracle,
 the demons, in the hearing of everyone, said: "We withdraw; for
 it is enough that we mocked them and made religious people
 think evil thoughts."

<!--
Et hoc dicto subito disparuerunt.
-->
 And, having said this, they vanished in the blink of an eye.

<!--
Omnes autem ad pedes monachi et mulieris inclamati veniam postulaverunt.
-->
 Then everyone begged pardon at the feet of the abused monk and woman.

<!--
Ecce quantam infamiam et scandalum atque inaestimabile damnum
diabolus contra religiosas personas procurasset nisi beata Virgo
succurrisset.
-->
 See how much disgrace and scandal and undeserving injury would
 have been managed by the devil against religious people, had
 not the blessed Virgin aided them.
