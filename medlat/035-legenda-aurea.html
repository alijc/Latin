<h4>The Golden Legend</h4>

<p>
<!--
Incipiensque igitur Barlaam coepit et de mundi creatione et hominis
praevaricatione ac filii Dei incarnatione, passione et resurrectione
longum sermonem contexere nec non et de die iudicii et de retributione
bonorum et malorum multa proferre et servientes idolis plurimum
exprobrare ac de eorum fatuitate tale exemplum ponere dicens:
â€œSagittarius quidam aviculam parvam nomine philomenam capiens, cum
vellet eam occidere, vox data est philomenae et ait: 'Quid tibi
proderit, o homo, si me occideris?
-->
 And so, beginning, Barlaam started
 to compose a long sermon about the creation of the world 
 and the transgression of man and 
 the incarnation, passion and resurrection of the son of God
 and also to mention many things
 about the day of judgement and 
 about the rewards for the good and evil 
 and to greatly reproach those who serve idols
 and to cite such an example of their foolishness,
 saying:
 "A certain archer, capturing a small bird, called a nightingale,
  when he wished to kill it, the nightingale was given a voice and said:
  'What will it benefit you, O man, if you kill me?

<!--
Neque enim ventrem tuum de me implere valebis, sed si me dimittere
velles, tria tibi mandata darem, quae si diligentius conservares,
magnam inde utilitatem consequi posses.'"
-->
 For you won't be able to fill your belly with me,
 but if you set me free, I will give you three maxims,
 by which, if you observe them carefully,
 you can achieve a great advantage.

<!--
Ille vero ad eius loquelam stupefactus promisit quod eam dimitteret
si haec sibi mandata proferret.
-->
 And so, struck dumb with amazement, he promised that he would set it free
 if it would make these maxims known to him.

<!--
Et illa: 'Numquam rem quae apprehendi non potest apprehendere
studeas; de re perdita irrecuperabili numquam doleas; verbum
incredibile numquam credas; haec tria custodi et bene tibi erit.'
-->
 And it said: 'You should never desire to lay hold of a thing that 
 cannot be caught; you should never grieve for a thing that has been
 irrecoverably lost; you should never accept the unbelievable as true;
 observe these three maxims and it will be well for you.'

<!--
Ille autem, ut promiserat, eam dimisit.
-->
 And he, as he had promised, released it.

<!--
Philomena igitur per aera volitans dixit ei: 'Vae tibi, homo,
quod malum consilium habuisti et quod magnum thesaurum hodie
perdidisti; est enim in meis visceribus margarita quae struthionis
ovum sua vincit magnitudine.'
-->
 Then the nightingale fluttered through the air and said to him:
 'Woe to you, man, because you've taken bad advice and because you've
 lost a great treasure today; for in my belly is a pearl that
 exceeds an ostrich egg in size.'

<!--
Quod ille audiens valde contristatus est quod eam dimiserit, et eam
apprehendere conabatur, dicens: 'Veni in domum meam et omnem tibi
humanitatem exhibebo et honorifice te dimittam.'
-->
 On hearing this he was overcome with sorrow that he had let it go,
 and tried to catch it, saying: 'Come into my house and I will show
 you every kindness and will send you away with honor.'

<!--
Cui philomena: 'Nunc pro certo cognovi te fatuum esse, nam ex his
quae tibi dixi nullum profectum habuisti, quia et de me, perdita et
irrecuperabili, doles et me temptas capere, cum nequeas meo itinere
pergere, et insuper margaritam tam grandem in meis visceribus
credidisti esse, cum ego tota ad magnitudinem ovi struthionis non
valeam pertingere.'
-->
 And the nightingale said to him: 'Now I know for certain that you
 are a fool, for you have learned nothing from what I told you,
 since you both grieve on account of me, lost and unrecoverable,
 and try to capture me, when you cannot proceed on my trail, and
 you also believe that such a large pearl is in my belly, when I am
 altogether not big enough to hold an ostrich egg.'

<!--
Sic ergo stulti sunt illi qui confidunt in idolis quia plasmatos a
se adorant et custoditos a se custodes suos appellant."
-->
 So thus they are fools who believe in idols because they love what
 they themselves created and call their protectors that which
 they themselves protect."
