<h4>The Golden Legend</h4>

<p>
<!--
Incipiensque igitur Barlaam coepit et de mundi creatione et hominis
praevaricatione ac filii Dei incarnatione, passione et resurrectione
longum sermonem contexere nec non et de die iudicii et de retributione
bonorum et malorum multa proferre et servientes idolis plurimum
exprobrare ac de eorum fatuitate tale exemplum ponere dicens:
“Sagittarius quidam aviculam parvam nomine philomenam capiens, cum
vellet eam occidere, vox data est philomenae et ait: 'Quid tibi
proderit, o homo, si me occideris?
-->
 And so, beginning, Barlaam started
 to compose a long sermon about the creation of the world 
 and the transgression of man and 
 the incarnation, passion and resurrection of the son of God
 and also to mention many things
 about the day of judgement and 
 about the rewards for the good and evil 
 and to greatly reproach those who serve idols
 and to cite such an example of their foolishness,
 saying:
 "A certain archer, capturing a small bird, called a nightingale,
  when he wished to kill it, the nightingale was given a voice and said:
  'What will it benefit you, O man, if you kill me?

<!--
Neque enim ventrem tuum de me implere valebis, sed si me dimittere
velles, tria tibi mandata darem, quae si diligentius conservares,
magnam inde utilitatem consequi posses.'"
-->
 For you won't be able to fill your belly with me,
 but if you set me free, I will give you three maxims,
 by which, if you observe them carefully,
 you can achieve a great advantage.

<!--
Ille vero ad eius loquelam stupefactus promisit quod eam dimitteret
si haec sibi mandata proferret.
-->
 And so, struck dumb with amazement, he promised that he would set it free
 if it would make these maxims known to him.

<!--
Et illa: 'Numquam rem quae apprehendi non potest apprehendere
studeas; de re perdita irrecuperabili numquam doleas; verbum
incredibile numquam credas; haec tria custodi et bene tibi erit.'
-->
 And it said: 'You should never desire to lay hold of a thing that 
 cannot be caught; you should never grieve for a thing that has been
 irrecoverably lost; you should never accept the unbelievable as true;
 observe these three maxims and it will be well for you.'

<!--
Ille autem, ut promiserat, eam dimisit.
-->
 And he, as he had promised, released it.

<!--
Philomena igitur per aera volitans dixit ei: 'Vae tibi, homo,
quod malum consilium habuisti et quod magnum thesaurum hodie
perdidisti; est enim in meis visceribus margarita quae struthionis
ovum sua vincit magnitudine.'
-->
 Then the nightingale fluttered through the air and said to him:
 'Woe to you, man, because you've taken bad advice and because you've
 lost a great treasure today; for in my belly is a pearl that
 exceeds an ostrich egg in size.'

<!--
Quod ille audiens valde contristatus est quod eam dimiserit, et eam
apprehendere conabatur, dicens: 'Veni in domum meam et omnem tibi
humanitatem exhibebo et honorifice te dimittam.'
-->
 On hearing this he was overcome with sorrow that he had let it go,
 and tried to catch it, saying: 'Come into my house and I will show
 you every kindness and will send you away with honor.'

<!--
Cui philomena: 'Nunc pro certo cognovi te fatuum esse, nam ex his
quae tibi dixi nullum profectum habuisti, quia et de me, perdita et
irrecuperabili, doles et me temptas capere, cum nequeas meo itinere
pergere, et insuper margaritam tam grandem in meis visceribus
credidisti esse, cum ego tota ad magnitudinem ovi struthionis non
valeam pertingere.'
-->
 And the nightingale said to him: 'Now I know for certain that you
 are a fool, for you have learned nothing from what I told you,
 since you both grieve on account of me, lost and unrecoverable,
 and try to capture me, when you cannot proceed on my trail, and
 you also believe that such a large pearl is in my belly, when I am
 altogether not big enough to hold an ostrich egg.'

<!--
Sic ergo stulti sunt illi qui confidunt in idolis quia plasmatos a
se adorant et custoditos a se custodes suos appellant."
-->
 So thus they are fools who believe in idols because they love what
 they themselves created and call their protectors that which
 they themselves protect."

<!--
Coepitque contra fallacem mundi delectationem et vanitatem multa
disputare et plura ad hoc exempla adducere, dicens: “Qui corporales
delectationes desiderant et animas suas fame mori permittunt similes
sunt cuidam homini qui dum a facie unicornis ne ab eo devoraretur
velocius fugeret, in quoddam barathrum magnum cecidit; dum autem
caderet, manibus arbustulam apprehendit quandam et in base quadam
lubrica et instabili pedes fixit.
-->
 And he began to argue many things against the false delights and
 vanities of the world and to bring many examples to this, saying:
 "Those who desire physical delights and allow their souls to die of
 hunger are like a man who, while he was racing away from the
 presence of a unicorn, so as to not be devoured by it, fell into a
 certain great abyss; but while he plummeted, he grabbed a shrub,
 and set his feet on a slippery and unstable support.

<!--
Respiciens vero vidit duos mures, unum album et unum nigrum,
incessanter radicem arbustulae quam apprehenderat corrodentes et iam
prope erat ut ipsam absciderent.
-->
 And gazing about he spied two mice, one white and one black,
 unceasingly gnawing away at the root of the shrub that he had laid
 hold of, and had already nearly cut it off.

<!--
In fundo autem barathri vidit draconem terribilem, spirantem ignem
et aperto ore ipsum devorare cupientem; super basim vero, ubi pedes
tenebat, vidit quattuor aspidum capita inde prodeuntia.
-->
 Now on the bottom of the abyss he saw a terrible dragon, breathing
 fire and eager to open its mouth and devour him; and indeed he saw,
 upon the support where he held his feet, the heads of four asps
 issuing out of it.

<!--
Elevans autem oculos vidit exiguum mellis de ramis illius
arbustulae stillans oblitusque periculi in quo undique positus erat se
ipsum dulcedini illius modici mellis totum dedit."
-->
 But raising his eys, he saw a bit of honey dripping from the
 branches of that shrub and, forgetting the danger that he was
 facing from every side, gave himself wholly to the sweetness of
 that small amount of honey."

<!--
"Unicornis autem mortis tenet figuram, quae hominem semper
persequitur et apprehendere cupit, barathrum vero mundus est, omnibus
malis plenus.
-->
AJC

"Now of the unicorn's death represents a form that always attacks
 man and desires to seize him.  And in truth the abyss is the
 world, filled with every evil.

<!--
Arbustula uniuscuiusque vita est, quae per horas diei et noctis
quasi per murem album et nigrum incessanter consumitur et incisioni
appropinquat.
-->
</p><p>
AJC

 The shrub is every man's life, which is continuously consumed
 through the hours of the day and the night, as if by a white and
 a black mouse, and draws near to being cut in two.

<!--
Basis vero aspidum quattuor corpus ex quattuor elementis
compositum, quibus inordinatis corporis compago dissolvitur.
-->
</p><p>
AJC

 And in truth the support with the four asps is the body, made up
 of the four elements.  And the structure of the body
 is dissolved by their disorder.

<!--
Draco terribilis os inferni, cunctos devorare cupiens; dulcedo
ramusculi delectatio fallax mundi, per quam homo seducitur ut
periculum suum minime intueatur."
-->
</p><p>
AJC

 The terrible dragon is hell, desiring to devour everyone; the
 delightful sweetness of the twig is the deceits of the world,
 through which man is led astray to little regard his own peril."
