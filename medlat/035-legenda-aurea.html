<!--
Incipiensque igitur Barlaam coepit et de mundi creatione et hominis
praevaricatione ac filii Dei incarnatione, passione et resurrectione
longum sermonem contexere nec non et de die iudicii et de retributione
bonorum et malorum multa proferre et servientes idolis plurimum
exprobrare ac de eorum fatuitate tale exemplum ponere dicens:
â€œSagittarius quidam aviculam parvam nomine philomenam capiens, cum
vellet eam occidere, vox data est philomenae et ait: 'Quid tibi
proderit, o homo, si me occideris?
-->
 AJC
 And so, beginning, Barlaam started
 to compose a long sermon about the creation of the world 
 and the transgression of man and 
 the incarnation, passion and resurrection of the son of God
 and also to mention many things
 about the day of judgement and 
 about the rewards for the good and evil 
 and to greatly reproach those who serve idols
 and to cite such an example of their foolishness,
 saying:
 "A certain archer, capturing a small bird, called a nightingale,
  when he wished to kill it, the nightingale was given a voice and said:
  'What will it benefit you, O man, if you kill me?
 </p>
 <p>

<!--
Neque enim ventrem tuum de me implere valebis, sed si me dimittere
velles, tria tibi mandata darem, quae si diligentius conservares,
magnam inde utilitatem consequi posses.'
-->
 AJC 
 For you won't be able to fill your belly with me,
 but if you will set me free, I will give you three commandments,
 by which, if you were to carefully observe them,
 you would be able to achieve a great advantage.
 </p>
 <p>

<!--
Ille vero ad eius loquelam stupefactus promisit quod eam dimitteret
si haec sibi mandata proferret.
-->
 AJC 
 And so, struck dumb with amazement, he promised that he would set it free
 if it would make these commandments known to him.
 </p>
 <p>

<!--
Et illa: 'Numquam rem quae apprehendi non potest apprehendere
studeas; de re perdita irrecuperabili numquam doleas; verbum
incredibile numquam credas; haec tria custodi et bene tibi erit.'
-->

 AJC
 And it said: 'You should never desire to lay hold of a thing that 
 cannot be caught; you should never grieve for a thing that has been
 irrecoverably lost; you should never accept the unbelievable as true;
 observe these three commandments and it will be well for you.'
</p>
