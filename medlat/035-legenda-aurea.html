<h4>The Golden Legend</h4>

<p>
<!--
Incipiensque igitur Barlaam coepit et de mundi creatione et hominis
praevaricatione ac filii Dei incarnatione, passione et resurrectione
longum sermonem contexere nec non et de die iudicii et de retributione
bonorum et malorum multa proferre et servientes idolis plurimum
exprobrare ac de eorum fatuitate tale exemplum ponere dicens:
“Sagittarius quidam aviculam parvam nomine philomenam capiens, cum
vellet eam occidere, vox data est philomenae et ait: 'Quid tibi
proderit, o homo, si me occideris?
-->
 And so, beginning, Barlaam started
 to compose a long sermon about the creation of the world 
 and the transgression of man and 
 the incarnation, passion and resurrection of the son of God
 and also to mention many things
 about the day of judgement and 
 about the rewards for the good and evil 
 and to greatly reproach those who serve idols
 and to cite such an example of their foolishness,
 saying:
 "A certain archer, capturing a small bird, called a nightingale,
  when he wished to kill it, the nightingale was given a voice and said:
  'What will it benefit you, O man, if you kill me?

<!--
Neque enim ventrem tuum de me implere valebis, sed si me dimittere
velles, tria tibi mandata darem, quae si diligentius conservares,
magnam inde utilitatem consequi posses.'"
-->
 For you won't be able to fill your belly with me,
 but if you set me free, I will give you three maxims,
 by which, if you observe them carefully,
 you can achieve a great advantage.

<!--
Ille vero ad eius loquelam stupefactus promisit quod eam dimitteret
si haec sibi mandata proferret.
-->
 And so, struck dumb with amazement, he promised that he would set it free
 if it would make these maxims known to him.

<!--
Et illa: 'Numquam rem quae apprehendi non potest apprehendere
studeas; de re perdita irrecuperabili numquam doleas; verbum
incredibile numquam credas; haec tria custodi et bene tibi erit.'
-->
 And it said: 'You should never desire to lay hold of a thing that 
 cannot be caught; you should never grieve for a thing that has been
 irrecoverably lost; you should never accept the unbelievable as true;
 observe these three maxims and it will be well for you.'

<!--
Ille autem, ut promiserat, eam dimisit.
-->
 And he, as he had promised, released it.

<!--
Philomena igitur per aera volitans dixit ei: 'Vae tibi, homo,
quod malum consilium habuisti et quod magnum thesaurum hodie
perdidisti; est enim in meis visceribus margarita quae struthionis
ovum sua vincit magnitudine.'
-->
 Then the nightingale fluttered through the air and said to him:
 'Woe to you, man, because you've taken bad advice and because you've
 lost a great treasure today; for in my belly is a pearl that
 exceeds an ostrich egg in size.'

<!--
Quod ille audiens valde contristatus est quod eam dimiserit, et eam
apprehendere conabatur, dicens: 'Veni in domum meam et omnem tibi
humanitatem exhibebo et honorifice te dimittam.'
-->
 On hearing this he was overcome with sorrow that he had let it go,
 and tried to catch it, saying: 'Come into my house and I will show
 you every kindness and will send you away with honor.'

<!--
Cui philomena: 'Nunc pro certo cognovi te fatuum esse, nam ex his
quae tibi dixi nullum profectum habuisti, quia et de me, perdita et
irrecuperabili, doles et me temptas capere, cum nequeas meo itinere
pergere, et insuper margaritam tam grandem in meis visceribus
credidisti esse, cum ego tota ad magnitudinem ovi struthionis non
valeam pertingere.'
-->
 And the nightingale said to him: 'Now I know for certain that you
 are a fool, for you have learned nothing from what I told you,
 since you both grieve on account of me, lost and unrecoverable,
 and try to capture me, when you cannot proceed on my trail, and
 you also believe that such a large pearl is in my belly, when I am
 altogether not big enough to hold an ostrich egg.'

<!--
Sic ergo stulti sunt illi qui confidunt in idolis quia plasmatos a
se adorant et custoditos a se custodes suos appellant."
-->
 So thus they are fools who believe in idols because they love what
 they themselves created and call their protectors that which
 they themselves protect."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Coepitque contra fallacem mundi delectationem et vanitatem multa
disputare et plura ad hoc exempla adducere, dicens: “Qui corporales
delectationes desiderant et animas suas fame mori permittunt similes
sunt cuidam homini qui dum a facie unicornis ne ab eo devoraretur
velocius fugeret, in quoddam barathrum magnum cecidit; dum autem
caderet, manibus arbustulam apprehendit quandam et in base quadam
lubrica et instabili pedes fixit.
-->
 And he began to argue many things against the false delights and
 vanities of the world and to bring many examples to this, saying:
 "Those who desire physical delights and allow their souls to die of
 hunger are like a man who, while he was racing away from the
 presence of a unicorn, so as to not be devoured by it, fell into a
 certain great abyss; but while he plummeted, he grabbed a shrub,
 and set his feet on a slippery and unstable support.

<!--
Respiciens vero vidit duos mures, unum album et unum nigrum,
incessanter radicem arbustulae quam apprehenderat corrodentes et iam
prope erat ut ipsam absciderent.
-->
 And gazing about he spied two mice, one white and one black,
 unceasingly gnawing away at the root of the shrub that he had laid
 hold of, and had already nearly cut it off.

<!--
In fundo autem barathri vidit draconem terribilem, spirantem ignem
et aperto ore ipsum devorare cupientem; super basim vero, ubi pedes
tenebat, vidit quattuor aspidum capita inde prodeuntia.
-->
 Now on the bottom of the abyss he saw a terrible dragon, breathing
 fire and eager to open its mouth and devour him; and indeed he saw,
 upon the support where he held his feet, the heads of four asps
 issuing out of it.

<!--
Elevans autem oculos vidit exiguum mellis de ramis illius
arbustulae stillans oblitusque periculi in quo undique positus erat se
ipsum dulcedini illius modici mellis totum dedit."
-->
 But raising his eys, he saw a bit of honey dripping from the
 branches of that shrub and, forgetting the danger that he was
 facing from every side, gave himself wholly to the sweetness of
 that small amount of honey."
</p>

<p>
<!--
"Unicornis autem mortis tenet figuram, quae hominem semper
persequitur et apprehendere cupit, barathrum vero mundus est, omnibus
malis plenus.
-->
"Now the unicorn represents a figure of death that forever attacks
 man and desires to seize him.  And in truth the abyss is the
 world, filled with every evil.

<!--
Arbustula uniuscuiusque vita est, quae per horas diei et noctis
quasi per murem album et nigrum incessanter consumitur et incisioni
appropinquat.
-->
 The shrub is every person's life, which is continuously consumed
 through the hours of the day and the night, as if by a white mouse and
 a black one, and draws near to being severed.

<!--
Basis vero aspidum quattuor corpus ex quattuor elementis
compositum, quibus inordinatis corporis compago dissolvitur.
-->
 And in truth the support with the four asps is the body, made up
 of the four elements.  And the structure of the body
 is dissolved by their disorder.

<!--
Draco terribilis os inferni, cunctos devorare cupiens; dulcedo
ramusculi delectatio fallax mundi, per quam homo seducitur ut
periculum suum minime intueatur."
-->
 The terrible dragon is the mouth of hell, desiring to devour
 everyone; the delightful sweetness of the twig is the deceit
 delight of the world, through which man is led astray to little
 regard his own peril."
</p>

<p>START</p>

<!--
Addidit quoque dicens: “Similes sunt iterum mundi amatores homini
qui tres amicos habuit, quorum unum plus quam se, secundum tantum
quantum se, tertium minus quam se et quasi nihil dilexit.
-->
<p>AJC
 And he also said: "Again, those who love the world are like the
 man who had three friends, the first of whom he esteemed more
 than he himself, the second the same as himself, and the third
 less than himself, as if he were nothing.
</p>

<!--
In magno itaque periculo positus et a rege citatus, cucurrit ad
primum amicum, eius auxilium quaerens, et qualiter eum dilexerit
semper commemorans.
-->
<p>AJC
 And so, when he was in great danger and summoned by the king, he
 ran to his first friend, asking for his help, and as he
 esteemed him as always keeping him in mind.
</p>

<!--
Cui ille: 'Nescio quis sis, O homo; habeo alios amicos, cum quibus
me hodie lactari oportet, quos et amicos amodo possidebo; praebeo
tamen tibi duo ciliciola ut habeas quibus valeas operiri.'
-->
<p>AJC
 But he told him: 'I don't know you, man; I have other friends,
 whose turn it is to flatter me today, and those are the friends
 that I'll hang on to from now on.  But I'll supply you with two
 blankets to wear, that you might be clothed.'
</p>

<!--
Confusus igitur ad secundum venit et similiter eius auxilium postulavit.
-->
<p>AJC
 And so, perplexed, he went to his second friend and likewise
 asked for help.
</p>

<!--
Cui ille: 'Non vacat mihi tecum subire agonem, curis etenim multis
circumdor; modicum tamen usque ad ostium palati te sociabo et statim
domum revertar, propriis vacans negotiis.'
-->
<p>AJC
 And he told him: 'I'm too busy to come up to the trial with you,
 seeing how I'm up to my ears with my own troubles.  But I'll put
 off my own business for a little bit and accompany you up to the
 door of the palace, and then return home at once.'
</p>

<!--
Tristis igitur et desperans ad tertium amicum perrexit sibique
facie demissa dixit: 'Non habeo os loquendi ad te quoniam non, ut
debui, amavi te sed, in tribulatione circumdatus et ab amicis
destitutus, rogo ut mihi auxilium feras et mihi veniam praebeas.'
-->
<p>AJC
 And so, worn out and in despair, he proceeded to his third
 friend and said to him with a downcast face: 'I don't have the
 right words to speak to you, for I own that I don't love you,
 but, in enveloped in troubles and bereft of friends, I pray that
 you give me aid and grant me a favor.'
</p>

<!--
Et ille hilari vultu dixit: 'Certe amicum carissimum fateor te esse
et tui, licet modici, beneficii non immemor praecedam te et apud regem
interveniam pro te ne in manibus te tradat inimicorum.'
-->
<p>AJC
 And he, with a cheerful face, said: 'Of course I acknowledge
 that you are my dear friend, and not heedless of your kindness,
 however small, I will go on ahead of you and intervene for you
 before the king, to keep him from delivering you into the hands
 of your enemies.'
