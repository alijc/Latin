<!--XXXVI Dei Ordinationi Resistendum Non Est-->
<h4>Resistance to the Law of God is Futile</h4>

<!--
Huius Conradi tempore, scilicet anno Domini MXXV, comes Lupoldus,
ut in quadam chronica dicitur, iram regis metuens cum uxore sua in
insulam fugiens in quodam tugurio latitabant.
-->
 In the time of this Conrad, that is, in 1025 AD, Count
 Leopold, as is related in a certain chronicle, fearing the king's 
 anger, fled with his wife to lie low in a cottage on an island.

<!--
In qua silva dum Caesar venaretur, nocte superveniente in eodem
tugurio ipsum oportuit hospitare.
-->
 Once, when the Emperor was hunting in that wood with night coming
 on, it behooved him to seek hospitality in that very cottage.

<!--
Cui hospita praegnans vicinaque partui decenter, ut potuit, stravit
et necessaria ministravit.
-->
 Now the lady of the house was with child, and close to giving
 birth, she properly, as well as she could, made up a bed and
 attended to his needs.

<!--
Eadem nocte mulier filium peperit et vocem tertio ad se venientem
Caesar audivit: “Conrade, hic puer modo progenitus gener tuus erit."
-->
 That night the woman bore a son and the Emperor heard a voice
 coming to him three times, saying: "Conrad, this new-born boy will
 be your son-in-law."

<!--
Mane ille surgens duos armigeros sibi secretarios ad se vocavit, dicens:
“Ite et puerulum illum de manibus matris violenter auferte et ipsum
per medium scindentes cor eius mihi portate."
-->
 In the morning he got up and, calling two attendants and
 confidential secretaries to him, said: "Go and tear this little
 boy out of his mother's arms by force, cut him in half and bring
 his heart to me."

<!--
Conciti illi euntes de gremio matris puerum rapuerunt.
-->
 They ran off headlong and snatched the boy from his mother's lap.

<!--
Quem videntes elegantissimae formae, misericordia commoti, ipsum super
quandam arborem ne a feris devoraretur reposuerunt et leporem
scindentes cor eius Caesari detulerunt.
-->
 But when they looked at his most attractive form they were moved
 to pity, and put him in a tree, so he wouldn't be devoured by wild beasts,
 and, after cutting open a hare, took its heart to the Emperor.

<!--
Eodem die dum quidam dux inde transiret et puerum vagientem
audiret, eum ad se duci fecit et, dum filium non haberet, uxori
attulit et, nutriri eum faciens, a se de uxore sua genitum esse 
finxit et Heinricum vocavit.
-->
 On that very day a certain duke was passing through that place
 and heard the boy squalling and had him fetched and, as he had no
 son of his own, took him to his wife and got him a wet-nurse.  He
 put out the story that his wife had given birth to him, and
 called him Henry. 

<!--
Cum igitur iam crevisset, erat corpore pulcherrimus, ore facundus
et omnibus gratiosus.
-->
 And so, after he had grown up, he was gorgeous to look at,
 well-spoken, and agreeble to everyone.
