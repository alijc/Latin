<!--XXXVI Dei Ordinationi Resistendum Non Est-->
<h4>Resistance to the Law of God is Futile</h4>

<p>
<!--
Huius Conradi tempore, scilicet anno Domini MXXV, comes Lupoldus,
ut in quadam chronica dicitur, iram regis metuens cum uxore sua in
insulam fugiens in quodam tugurio latitabant.
-->
 In the time of this Conrad, that is, in 1025 AD, Count
 Leopold, as is related in a certain chronicle, fearing the king's 
 anger, fled with his wife to lie low in a cottage on an island.

<!--
In qua silva dum Caesar venaretur, nocte superveniente in eodem
tugurio ipsum oportuit hospitare.
-->
 Once, when the Emperor was hunting in that wood with night coming
 on, it behooved him to seek hospitality in that very cottage.

<!--
Cui hospita praegnans vicinaque partui decenter, ut potuit, stravit
et necessaria ministravit.
-->
 Now the lady of the house was with child, and close to giving
 birth, she properly, as well as she could, made up a bed and
 attended to his needs.

<!--
Eadem nocte mulier filium peperit et vocem tertio ad se venientem
Caesar audivit: “Conrade, hic puer modo progenitus gener tuus erit."
-->
 That night the woman bore a son and the Emperor heard a voice
 coming to him three times, saying: "Conrad, this new-born boy will
 be your son-in-law."

<!--
Mane ille surgens duos armigeros sibi secretarios ad se vocavit, dicens:
“Ite et puerulum illum de manibus matris violenter auferte et ipsum
per medium scindentes cor eius mihi portate."
-->
 In the morning he got up and, calling two attendants and
 confidential secretaries to him, said: "Go and tear this little
 boy out of his mother's arms by force, cut him in half and bring
 his heart to me."

<!--
Conciti illi euntes de gremio matris puerum rapuerunt.
-->
 They ran off headlong and snatched the boy from his mother's lap.

<!--
Quem videntes elegantissimae formae, misericordia commoti, ipsum super
quandam arborem ne a feris devoraretur reposuerunt et leporem
scindentes cor eius Caesari detulerunt.
-->
 But when they looked at his most attractive form they were moved
 to pity, and put him in a tree, so he wouldn't be devoured by wild beasts,
 and, after cutting open a hare, took its heart to the Emperor.

<!--
Eodem die dum quidam dux inde transiret et puerum vagientem
audiret, eum ad se duci fecit et, dum filium non haberet, uxori
attulit et, nutriri eum faciens, a se de uxore sua genitum esse 
finxit et Heinricum vocavit.
-->
 On that very day a certain duke was passing through that place
 and heard the boy squalling and had him fetched and, as he had no
 son of his own, took him to his wife and got him a wet-nurse.  He
 put out the story that his wife had given birth to him, and
 called him Henry. 

<!--
Cum igitur iam crevisset, erat corpore pulcherrimus, ore facundus
et omnibus gratiosus.
-->
 And so, after he had grown up, he was gorgeous to look at,
 well-spoken, and agreeble to everyone.

<!--
Quem Caesar, tam decorum et prudentem videns, a patre ipsum petiit
et in curia sua manere fecit, sed eum videret puerum omnibus gratiosum
et ab omnibus commendari, dubitare coepit ne post se regnaret et ne
iste sit ille quem occidi mandaverat.
-->
 And then the Emperor, seeing such a graceful and skilled young man,
 asked for him from his father and had him remain in his own court.
 But when he saw that the lad was gracious to all and commended by
 everyone, he began to fear that he would reign after him and that
 he might be the one that he had ordered to be done away with.

<!--
Volens igitur esse securus, litteras manibus suis scriptas per eum
uxori dirigit in hunc modum: “In quantum est tibi cara vita tua, mox
ut litteras istas receperis puerum hunc necabis."
-->
 Therefore, wishing to be safe, he had him carry a letter, written with his
 own hand, to his wife, in this manner: "As you value your life, as
 soon as you receive this letter, put this lad to death."

<!--
Dum igitur pergens in quadam ecclesia hospitatus fuisset et fessus super
bancum quiesceret et bursa in qua erant litterae dependeret, sacerdos,
curiositate ductus, bursam aperuit et litteras sigillo regis munitas
videns ipsas salvo sigillo aperuit et legens scelus abhorruit et
radens subtiliter quod dicebatur: “Istum necabis,” scripsit: “Filiam
nostram isti in uxorem dabis."
-->
 And so while the lad was on the road he put up at a certain church to
 lodge and, exhausted, fell asleep on a bench, with the bag that
 held the letter hanging down.  The priest, led by curiousity,
 opened the bag and, seeing a letter done up with the king's seal,
 saved off the seal and opened the letter.  On reading it he was
 aghast at the wickedness and cleverly erasing where it said: "Put
 him to death," he wrote: "Give this man to our daughter in
 matrimony."

<!--
Cumque regina litteras sigillo imperatoris munitas videret et de
manu imperatoris scriptas esse cognosceret, convocatis principibus,
celebravit nuptias et filiam suam eidem in uxorem dedit.
-->
 And when the queen saw the letter done up with the imperial seal
 and recognized that it was written by the emporor's hand, she
 called the chiefs together and celebrated the wedding and gave her
 daughter to him in matrimony.

<!--
Quae nuptiae Aquisgrani celebratae sunt.
-->
 And the nuptials were celebrated in Aix-la-Chapelle.

<!--
Cum autem Caesari a dicentibus narraretur quod sollemniter fuissent filiae
suae nuptiae celebratae, ille obstupefactus, a duobus armigeris et
duce et sacerdote veritate comperta, Dei ordinationi resistendum non
esse vidit et ideo pro puero mittens, eum esse suum generum approbavit
et post se regnare instituit.
-->
 Now when the Emporor was told that his daughter's nuptials had been
 solemnly celebrated, he was astounded, and having ascertained the
 truth from two squires, a general and a priest, he saw that it
 would be futile to resist the will of God and so sent for the lad,
 affirmed him as his son-in-law and set him up to reign after himself. 

<!--
In loco autem ubi puer Heinricus natus fuit nobile monasterium aedificatum
est quod usque hodie Ursania nominata est.
-->
 Now in the place where the boy Henry was born a famous monastery
 was built that is called Ursania up to this day.
