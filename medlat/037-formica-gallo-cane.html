<!--XXXVII. De Formica, Gallo, Cane-->
<h4>AJC On the Ant, the Cock and the Dog</h4>

<p>AJC
<!--
Balaam, qui lingua Arabica vocatur Lucaman, dixit filio suo: Fili,
ne sit formica sapientior te, quae congregat in aestate unde vivat in
hieme.
-->
Balaam, who is called Lucaman in Arabic, said to his son: Son,
let not the ant be wiser than you, that it gathers in the summer the 
wherewithal to live in the winter.
</p> 
 

<p>AJC
<!--
Fili, ne sit gallus vigilantior te, qui in matutinis vigilat, et tu dormis.
-->
Son, let not the cock be more watchful than you, that it wakes in the morning,
and you sleep.
</p> 
 

<p>AJC
<!--
Fili, ne sit gallus fortior te, qui iustificat decem uxores suas,
tu solam castigare non potes.
-->
Son, let not the cock be firmer than you, that it keeps order among its
ten wives, while you cannot correct your single one.
</p> 
 

<p>AJC
<!--
Fili, ne sit canis corde nobilior te, qui benefactorum suorum
non obliviscitur, tu autem benefactorum tuorum oblivisceris.
-->
Son, let not the dog be nobler in heart than you, that it does not forget its
benefactors, but you do forget your benefactors.
</p> 
 

<p>AJC
<!--
Fili, ne videatur tibi parum unum habere inimicum vel nimium mille
habere amicos.
-->
Son, let it not seem to you that having one enemy is a small thing,
or having a thousand friends is a great one.
</p> 
 

<p>AJC
<!--
Dico tibi:  Exemplum I. De dimidio amico.
-->
I say to you: Example I. About half a friend.
</p> 
 

<p>AJC
<!--
Arabs moriturus vocato filio suo dixit: “Dic, fili, quot tibi, dum
vixi, adquisieris amicos."
-->
An Arab who was about to die summoned his son and said: "Tell me, my son, 
how many friends did you gain during my lifetime."
</p> 
 

<p>AJC
<!--
Respondens filius dixit: “Centum, ut arbitror, mihi adquisivi amicos."
-->
And his son replied, saying: "I gained, I think, a hundred friends."
</p> 
 

<p>AJC
<!--
Dixit pater: “Philosophus dicit: 'Ne laudes amicum donec probaveris eum.'
-->
His father said: "A philosopher said: 'You should not praise a friend until you
have tested him.'
</p> 

<p>AJC
<!--
Ego quidem prior natus sum et unius dimidietatem vix mihi adquisivi.
-->
Indeed, I was born before you and have gained scarcely half a friend.
</p> 
 

<p>AJC
<!--
Tu ergo centum quomodo tibi adquisisti?
-->
How then have you gained a hundred?
</p> 

<p>AJC
<!--
Vade igitur probare omnes, ut cognoscas si quis omnium tibi
perfectus erit amicus."
-->
Therefore go and test them all, so that you might learn if any of them
is fully your friend."
</p> 
 

<p>AJC
<!--
Dixit filius: “Quomodo probare consulis?"
-->
The son said: "How do you advise me to test them?"
</p>
