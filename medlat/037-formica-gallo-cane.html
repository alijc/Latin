<!--XXXVII. De Formica, Gallo, Cane-->
<h4>On the Ant, the Cock and the Dog</h4>

<p>
<!--
Balaam, qui lingua Arabica vocatur Lucaman, dixit filio suo: Fili,
ne sit formica sapientior te, quae congregat in aestate unde vivat in
hieme.
-->
Balaam, who is called Lucaman in Arabic, said to his son: Son,
don't let the ant, that gathers in the summer what it needs
to live on in the winter, be wiser than you.
 
<!--
Fili, ne sit gallus vigilantior te, qui in matutinis vigilat, et tu dormis.
-->
Son, don't let the cock, that wakes in the morning
while you are asleep, be more watchful than you.
 
<!--
Fili, ne sit gallus fortior te, qui iustificat decem uxores suas,
tu solam castigare non potes.
-->
Son, don't let the cock, that keeps order among its ten wives,
while you cannot correct your single one, be firmer than you.

<!--
Fili, ne sit canis corde nobilior te, qui benefactorum suorum
non obliviscitur, tu autem benefactorum tuorum oblivisceris.
-->
Son, don't let the dog, that does not forget its benefactors, 
while you do forget your benefactors, be nobler in heart than you.

<!--
Fili, ne videatur tibi parum unum habere inimicum vel nimium mille
habere amicos.
-->
Son, don't let it seem too little to you to have one enemy,
or too much to have a thousand friends.
