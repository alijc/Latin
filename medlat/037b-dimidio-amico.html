<!--XXXVII(b). De dimidio amico-->

<p>AJC
<!--
Dico tibi:  Exemplum I. De dimidio amico.
-->
I say to you: Example I. About half a friend.
</p> 
 

<p>AJC
<!--
Arabs moriturus vocato filio suo dixit: “Dic, fili, quot tibi, dum
vixi, adquisieris amicos."
-->
An Arab who was about to die summoned his son and said: "Tell me, my son, 
how many friends did you gain during my lifetime."
</p> 
 

<p>AJC
<!--
Respondens filius dixit: “Centum, ut arbitror, mihi adquisivi amicos."
-->
And his son replied, saying: "I gained, I think, a hundred friends."
</p> 
 

<p>AJC
<!--
Dixit pater: “Philosophus dicit: 'Ne laudes amicum donec probaveris eum.'
-->
His father said: "A philosopher said: 'You should not praise a friend until you
have tested him.'
</p> 

<p>AJC
<!--
Ego quidem prior natus sum et unius dimidietatem vix mihi adquisivi.
-->
Indeed, I was born before you and have gained scarcely half a friend.
</p> 
 

<p>AJC
<!--
Tu ergo centum quomodo tibi adquisisti?
-->
How then have you gained a hundred?
</p> 

<p>AJC
<!--
Vade igitur probare omnes, ut cognoscas si quis omnium tibi
perfectus erit amicus."
-->
Therefore go and test them all, so that you might learn if any of them
is fully your friend."
</p> 
 

<p>AJC
<!--
Dixit filius: “Quomodo probare consulis?"
-->
The son said: "How do you advise me to test them?"
</p> 

<p>AJC
<!--
Dixit pater: “Vitulum interfectum et frustatim comminutum in sacco
repone, ita ut saccus forinsecus sanguine infectus sit.
-->
The father said: "Put a calf that has been killed and torn into bits
into a sack, so that the blood seeps through to the outside of the sack.
</p> 

<p>AJC
<!--
Et cum ad amicum veneris, dic ei: 'Hominem, care mi, forte
interfeci; rogo te ut eum secreto sepelias; nemo enim te suspectum
habebit, sicque me salvare poteris.' ”
-->
And when you come to a friend, tell him: 'As luck would have it, dear one,
I have killed a man; I pray that you will bury him secretly; 
for no one will suspect you, and so you can save me.'"
</p> 

<p>AJC
<!--
Fecit filius sicut pater imperavit.
-->
The son did as his father commanded.
</p>
