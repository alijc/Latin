<!--XXXVII(b). De dimidio amico-->

<p>
<!--
Dico tibi:  Exemplum I. De dimidio amico.
-->
I say to you: Example I. About half a friend.
</p> 
 
<p>
<!--
Arabs moriturus vocato filio suo dixit: “Dic, fili, quot tibi, dum
vixi, adquisieris amicos."
-->
An Arab who was about to die summoned his son and said: "Tell me, my son, 
how many friends did you gain during my lifetime."

<!--
Respondens filius dixit: “Centum, ut arbitror, mihi adquisivi amicos."
-->
And his son replied, saying: "I gained, I think, a hundred friends."

<!--
Dixit pater: “Philosophus dicit: 'Ne laudes amicum donec probaveris eum.'
-->
His father said: "A philosopher said: 'You should not praise a friend until you
have tested him.'

<!--
Ego quidem prior natus sum et unius dimidietatem vix mihi adquisivi.
-->
Indeed, I was born before you and have gained scarcely half a friend for myself.
 

<!--
Tu ergo centum quomodo tibi adquisisti?
-->
How then have you gained a hundred?

<!--
Vade igitur probare omnes, ut cognoscas si quis omnium tibi
perfectus erit amicus."
-->
Therefore go and test them all, so that you might learn whether any of them
is fully your friend."
 
<!--
Dixit filius: “Quomodo probare consulis?"
-->
The son said: "How do you advise me to test them?"

<!--
Dixit pater: “Vitulum interfectum et frustatim comminutum in sacco
repone, ita ut saccus forinsecus sanguine infectus sit.
-->
The father said: "Put a calf that has been killed and cut into bits
into a sack, so that the blood seeps through to the outside of the sack.

<!--
Et cum ad amicum veneris, dic ei: 'Hominem, care mi, forte
interfeci; rogo te ut eum secreto sepelias; nemo enim te suspectum
habebit, sicque me salvare poteris.' ”
-->
And when you come to a friend, tell him: 'Buddy, I have accidentally
killed a man; I beg you to bury him in secret; 
for no one will suspect you, and so you can save me.'"

<!--
Fecit filius sicut pater imperavit.
-->
The son did as his father commanded.

<p>START</p> 
</p> 
 

<p>AJC
<!--
Primus autem amicus ad quem venit dixit ei: “Fer tecum mortuum
super collum tuum.
-->
Now the first friend that he came to said to him: 
"Carry the corpse on your own neck.
</p> 

<p>AJC
<!--
Sicut fecisti malum, patere satisfactionem.
-->
Just as you have done evil, suffer the punishment.
</p> 

<p>AJC
<!--
In domum meam non intrabis."
-->
You will not enter my house."
</p> 

<p>AJC
<!--
Cum autem per singulos sic fecisset, eodem responso ei omnes responderunt.
-->
Now when he had done the same for each of his friends, 
everyone gave him the same response.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Ad patrem ergo rediens, nuntiavit quae fecerat.
-->
And so, returning to his father, he reported what he had done.
</p> 

<p>AJC
<!--
Dixit pater: “Contigit tibi quod dixit philosophus: 'Multi sunt dum
numerantur amici, sed in necessitate pauci.'
-->
His father said: "What the philosopher said has happened to you: 
'There are many friends when counted, but few when in need.'
</p> 

<p>AJC
<!--
Vade ad dimidium amicum meum quem habeo, et vide quid dicat tibi."
-->
Go to the half-friend that I have, and see what he says to you."
</p> 

<p>AJC
<!--
Venit et, sicut aliis dixerat, huic ait.
-->
He went and, as he had spoken to the others, spoke to him.
</p> 

<p>AJC
<!--
Qui dixit: “Intra domum.
-->
And he said: "Come into my house.
</p> 

<p>AJC
<!--
Non est hoc secretum quod vicinis debeat propalari.”
-->
This is not a secret that should be broadcast to my neighbors."
</p> 

<p>AJC
<!--
Emissa ergo uxore cum omni familia sua sepulturam fodit.
-->
And so, after sending his wife outside with the rest of his family, 
he dug a grave.
</p> 

<p>AJC
<!--
Cum autem ille omnia parata videret, rem prout erat disseruit, gratias agens.
-->
But when he saw that everything was prepared, 
he explained just what the business was, and thanked him.
</p> 

<p>AJC
<!--
Deinde patri retulit quae fecerat.
-->
And then he reported to his father what he had done.
</p> 

<p>AJC
<!--
Pater vero ait: “Pro tali amico dicit philosophus: 'Hic est vere
amicus qui te adiuvat, cum saeculum tibi deficit.'"
-->
Indeed his father told him: "The philosopher has said this about such a friend:
'The man is truly a friend who helps you when the world fails you.'"
