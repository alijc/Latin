<!--XXXVIIc Exemplum II. De integro amico.-->
<h4>Example II. On the Perfect Friend</h4>
 
<p>
<!--
At pater:  Exemplum II. De integro amico.
-->
And the father said:  Example II. On the perfect friend.
</p>

<!--
â€œRelatum est mihi de duobus negotiatoribus, quorum unus erat in
Aegypto, alter Baldach, seque solo auditu cognoverant et per
internuntios pro sibi necessariis mittebant.
-->
A story was told to me about two merchants, one of whom was in
Egypt, and the other in Babylon, and they knew each other by 
hearsay alone, and would send for what they needed through 
intermediaries.

<!--
Contigit autem ut qui erat Baldach in negotiationem in Aegyptum iret.
-->
Now it happened that the Babylonian went to Egypt for business.

<!--
Aegyptiacus audito eius adventu occurrit ei et suscepit eum gaudens
in domum suam et in omnibus ei servivit sicut mos est amicorum per
octo dies, et ostendit ei omnes manerias cantus quas habebat in domo
sua.
-->
When the Egyptian heard of his arrival he hurried to meet him and 
received him, rejoicing, into his home and served him in everything 
for eight days, as is the custom among friends, and showed him all
sorts of poetry that he had in his house.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Finitis octo diebus infirmatus est.
-->
At the end of eight days he fell ill.
</p> 
 
<p>AJC
<!--
Quod valde graviter dominus de amico suo ferens adscivit omnes
medicos Aegyptiacos ut amicum hospitem viderent.
-->
Because of the deep feeling that the host bore towards his friend, 
he brought in all the Egyptian doctors to examine his guest-friend.
</p> 
 
<p>AJC
<!--
Medici vero, palpato pulsu, iterum et iterum urina respecta, nullam
in eo agnoverunt infirmitatem.
-->
Indeed the doctors, after taking his pulse and inspecting his urine
again and again, didn't recognize his illness.
</p> 
 
<p>AJC
<!--
Et quia per hoc nullam corporalem agnovere infirmitatem, amoris
sciunt esse passionem.
-->
And because they discerned no physical illness through this, 
they understood it to be the suffering of love.
