<!--XXXVIIc Exemplum II. De integro amico.-->
<h4>Example II. On the Perfect Friend</h4>
 
<p>
<!--
At pater:  Exemplum II. De integro amico.
-->
And the father said:  Example II. On the perfect friend.
</p> 
 
<p>
<!--
“Relatum est mihi de duobus negotiatoribus, quorum unus erat in
Aegypto, alter Baldach, seque solo auditu cognoverant et per
internuntios pro sibi necessariis mittebant.
-->
A story was told to me about two merchants, one of whom was in
Egypt, and the other in Babylon, and they knew each other by 
hearsay alone, and would send for what they needed through 
intermediaries.

<!--
Contigit autem ut qui erat Baldach in negotiationem in Aegyptum iret.
-->
Now it happened that the Babylonian went to Egypt for business.

<!--
Aegyptiacus audito eius adventu occurrit ei et suscepit eum gaudens
in domum suam et in omnibus ei servivit sicut mos est amicorum per
octo dies, et ostendit ei omnes manerias cantus quas habebat in domo
sua.
-->
When the Egyptian heard of his arrival he hurried to meet him and 
received him, rejoicing, into his home and served him in everything 
for eight days, as is the custom among friends, and showed him all
sorts of poetry that he had in his house.

<!--
Finitis octo diebus infirmatus est.
-->
At the end of eight days he fell ill.

<!--
Quod valde graviter dominus de amico suo ferens adscivit omnes
medicos Aegyptiacos ut amicum hospitem viderent.
-->
Because of the deep feeling that the host bore towards his friend, 
he brought in all the Egyptian doctors to examine his guest-friend.
 
<!--
Medici vero, palpato pulsu, iterum et iterum urina respecta, nullam
in eo agnoverunt infirmitatem.
-->
Indeed the doctors, after taking his pulse and inspecting his urine
again and again, didn't recognize his illness.
 
<!--
Et quia per hoc nullam corporalem agnovere infirmitatem, amoris
sciunt esse passionem.
-->
And because they discerned no physical illness through this, 
they understood it to be the suffering of love.
 
<!-- 
Hoc agnito dominus venit ad eum et quaesivit si qua esset mulier in
domo sua quam diligeret.
-->
When his host learned this he went to him and asked if there was a 
woman in his house that he loved.

<!-- 
Ad haec aeger: “Ostende mihi omnes domus tuae mulieres, et si forte
inter eas hanc videro, tibi ostendam."
-->
The sick man said to him: "Show me all the women of your house, 
and if perchance I see such a one among them, I'll point her out."

<!--
Quo audito ei ostendit cantatrices et pedissequas; quarum nulla ei
complacuit.
-->
Whe he heard this he showed him songstresses and handmaidens;
none of whom he took a fancy to.

<!--
Post hoc ostendit ei omnes filias; has quoque sicut et priores
omnino reppulit atque neglexit.
-->
After this he showed him all of his daughters; and he likewise
altogether rebuffed and disregarded them just as before.

<!--
Habebat autem dominus quandam nobilem puellam in domo sua, quam iam diu
educaverat ut eam acciperet in uxorem; quam et ostendit ei.
-->
Now the host had in his house a certain well-born maiden, whom he had
long raised in order to take her as his wife; he showed her to him
as well.

<!--
Aeger vero, adspecta hac, ait: "Ex hac est mihi mors et in hac est
mihi vita."
-->
In truth when the sick man saw her, he said: "To be away from her is
death to me and to be with her is life to me."

<!--
Quo audito dedit ei puellam nobilem in uxorem cum omnibus quae erat
cum ea accepturus.
-->
When he heard this he gave the well-born maiden to him to wed,
along with everything that he would have received with her.

<!--
Et praeterea dedit ei ea quae erat daturus puellae si eam acciperet
in uxorem.
-->
And in addition he gave him the things that he would have given to the
maiden if he had taken her in marriage.

<!--
His completis, accepta uxore, cum his quae cum uxore acceperat et
negotiatione facta rediit in patriam.
-->
When these things were done, and he had taken her to wife, 
along with the things that he had received with his wife, and
the business completed, he returned to his homeland.
</p> 
 
<p> 
<!--
Contigit autem post haec ut Aegyptiacus omnia sua multis modis
amitteret et pauper effectus cogitavit apud se quod iret Baldach ad
amicum quem ibi habebat, ut sui misereretur.
-->
Now it befell after these events that the Egyptian, who had lost all
his possessions in several ways and become a pauper, thought to
himself that he would go to Babylon to the friend that he had
there, to gain his compassion.
 
<!--
Iter ergo nudus et famelicus arripuit atque Baldach intempestae
noctis silentio pervenit.
-->
And so he took up the journey, naked and starving, and reached
Babylon in the silence of a dark and stormy night.
 
<!--
Pudor autem ei obstabat ne domum amici adiret, ne forte incognitus
tali tempore domo expelleretur.
-->
But bashfulness kept him from going to the house of his friend, for
fear that perchance he would not be recognized at such a time and
would be thrown out of the house.
 
<!--
Templum ergo quoddam antiquum intravit ut ibidem pernoctaret.
-->
And so he entered into an ancient church so he could spend the
night there. 

<!--
Sed cum ibi anxius multa secum diu volveret occurrerunt sibi duo
viri prope templum in civitate, quorum unus alium interfecit clamque
aufugit.
-->
Now while the uneasy man was for a long time turning over many things
in his mind, two men ran to meet each other near the church in the
city, of one whom killed the other and fled without a trace.

<!--
Multi ergo cives pro strepitu decurrentes interfectum repperierunt,
et quaerentes quisnam homicidium perpetrasset, intraverunt templum
sperantes homicidam ibi reperire.
-->
Therefore many townspeople, rushing down on account of the uproar,
discovered the killing, and asking who in the world might have
carried out the murder, entered the church, hoping to discover the
murderer there.

<!--
Aegyptiacum vero illic repperierunt et sciscitantes ab eo quisnam
virum interfecisset audierunt ab ipso quia “ego illum interfeci."
-->
Indeed, they discovered the Egyptian there and, asking him who might
have killed the man, heard him say, "I killed him".

<!--
Paupertatem enim suam morte saltem finire vehementer cupiebat.
-->
For he fiercely longed to end his poverty, even with his death. 
 
<!--
Captus itaque et incarceratus est.
-->
And so he was arrested and imprisoned.
 
<!--
Mane autem facto producitur ante iudices et morte condemnatus
ducitur ad crucem.
-->
Now in the morning he's led out before the judges, and sentenced
to die and taken to the cross.

<!--
Multi vero de more accurrerunt, quorum unus fuit amicus eius cuius
causa Baldach adierat.
-->
Indeed many men came running from habit, one of whom was his friend,
and the reason he had come to Babylon.

<!--
Et acutius eum intuens deprehendit esse amicum quem in Aegypto reliquerat.
-->
And, looking at him quite sharply, he recognized that it was his friend that
he'd left in Egypt.

<!--
Reminiscens itaque bonorum quae sibi in Aegypto fecerat, cogitans
etiam quia post mortem retribuere illi non poterat, mortem pro ipso
subire se decrevit.
-->
And so, recollecting some of the good deeds that he had done for him in Egypt,
and thinking as well that he could not recompense him after his death, he
resolved to undergo death in his place.

<!--
Voce igitur magna exclamavit: “Quid innocentem condemnatis quove eum ducitis?
-->
And so he exclaimed in a loud voice: "Why are you condemning an innocent man,
and how are you leading him?

<!--
Non mortem meruit, ego virum interfeci."
-->
He does not deserve death, _I_ killed the man."

<!--
At illi iniecerunt manus in eum atque ligatum secum ad crucem
traxerunt aliumque a poena mortis absolverunt.
-->
And they struck him with their fists and dragged him, bound, to the cross
and released the other man from the pain of death.

<!--
Homicida vero in eodem agmine haec intuens gradiebatur atque secum
ait: “Hunc interfeci et iste damnatur.
-->
Indeed, the murderer was advancing in the very same crowd and regarding these
things, and said to himself: "I killed him, and this one is condemned.

<!--
Hic innocens supplicio deputatur, ego vero nocens libertate fruor.
-->
This innocent man is cut off with suffering, while I, the guilty one, enjoy my
freedom. 

<!--
Quaenam causa est huius iniustitiae?
-->
What then is the reason for this injustice?

<!--
Nescio, nisi sola sit Dei patientia.
-->
I don't know, unless it is the tolerance of God.  

<!--
Verum Deus, iudex iustus, impunitum scelus nullum dimittit.
-->
The true God, the just judge, dismisses no crime.

<!--
Ne igitur posterius in me durius vindicet, huius me prodam criminis
reum; sicque eos a morte absolvendo quod commisi luam peccatum."
-->
Therefore, to keep him from punishing me later more harshly, 
I will give myself up as guilty; and so, releasing them from
the death that I brought about, I will atone for the sin.

<!--
Obiecit se ergo periculo dicens: “Me, me, qui feci; istum dimittite
innoxium.”
-->
Therefore he threw himself into danger, saying: "It is me, me who did it;
Send that man away."

<!-- 
Iudices autem non parum admirantes, hunc, alio a morte absoluto, ligaverunt.
-->
Now the judges, not a little astonished, released the other man from death and
bound this man.
 
<!--
Iamque de iudicio dubitantes, hunc cum reliquis prius liberatis ante
regem duxerunt eique omnia ex ordine referentes ipsum etiam haesitare 
compulerunt.
-->
And still uncertain about the sentence, they led this man before the
king, along with the others who had been freed before, and reported
the whole series of events to him, giving him pause as well.
 
<!--
Communi itaque consilio rex eis omne crimen quod sibi imposuerant
condonavit, eo tamen pacto ut criminis sibi impositi causas
patefacerent.
-->
And so by common consent the king pardoned the men of each charge that had
been laid against them, on the condition that they explain to him
why they had imposed the punishment on themselves.

<!--
At illi rei veritatem ei exposuerunt.
-->
But they set forth the truth to the king.

<!--
Communi autem consensu omnibus absolutis, indigena qui pro amico mori
decreverat ipsum in domum suam introduxit eique, omni honore pro ritu
facto, inquit: “Si mecum manere adquiescis, omnia nobis prout decet
erunt communia; si vero repatriare volueris, quae mea sunt aequa lance
partiamur."
-->
Now by the common consent of everyone they were released, and the native
man, who had determined to die in his his friend's place, led him into
his house and, after every mark of esteem had been shown, said to him:
"If you assent to remain with me, it is proper for us that everything
will be common property; indeed, if you wish to return, let everything
that is mine be divided equally."

<!--
At ille natalis soli dulcedine irretitus, partem totius substantiae
quam ei obtulerat recepit sicque repatriavit.
-->
But he, entangled by fondness for his native land, accepted a
portion of entire wealth that had been offered to him and so
returned to his home.
