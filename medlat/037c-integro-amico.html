<!--XXXVIIc Exemplum II. De integro amico.-->
<h4>Example II. On the Perfect Friend</h4>
 
<p>
<!--
At pater:  Exemplum II. De integro amico.
-->
And the father said:  Example II. On the perfect friend.
</p> 
 
<p>
<!--
“Relatum est mihi de duobus negotiatoribus, quorum unus erat in
Aegypto, alter Baldach, seque solo auditu cognoverant et per
internuntios pro sibi necessariis mittebant.
-->
A story was told to me about two merchants, one of whom was in
Egypt, and the other in Babylon, and they knew each other by 
hearsay alone, and would send for what they needed through 
intermediaries.

<!--
Contigit autem ut qui erat Baldach in negotiationem in Aegyptum iret.
-->
Now it happened that the Babylonian went to Egypt for business.

<!--
Aegyptiacus audito eius adventu occurrit ei et suscepit eum gaudens
in domum suam et in omnibus ei servivit sicut mos est amicorum per
octo dies, et ostendit ei omnes manerias cantus quas habebat in domo
sua.
-->
When the Egyptian heard of his arrival he hurried to meet him and 
received him, rejoicing, into his home and served him in everything 
for eight days, as is the custom among friends, and showed him all
sorts of poetry that he had in his house.

<!--
Finitis octo diebus infirmatus est.
-->
At the end of eight days he fell ill.

<!--
Quod valde graviter dominus de amico suo ferens adscivit omnes
medicos Aegyptiacos ut amicum hospitem viderent.
-->
Because of the deep feeling that the host bore towards his friend, 
he brought in all the Egyptian doctors to examine his guest-friend.
 
<!--
Medici vero, palpato pulsu, iterum et iterum urina respecta, nullam
in eo agnoverunt infirmitatem.
-->
Indeed the doctors, after taking his pulse and inspecting his urine
again and again, didn't recognize his illness.
 
<!--
Et quia per hoc nullam corporalem agnovere infirmitatem, amoris
sciunt esse passionem.
-->
And because they discerned no physical illness through this, 
they understood it to be the suffering of love.
 
<!-- 
Hoc agnito dominus venit ad eum et quaesivit si qua esset mulier in
domo sua quam diligeret.
-->
When his host learned this he went to him and asked if there was a 
woman in his house that he loved.

<!-- 
Ad haec aeger: “Ostende mihi omnes domus tuae mulieres, et si forte
inter eas hanc videro, tibi ostendam."
-->
The sick man said to him: "Show me all the women of your house, 
and if perchance I see such a one among them, I'll point her out."

<!--
Quo audito ei ostendit cantatrices et pedissequas; quarum nulla ei
complacuit.
-->
Whe he heard this he showed him songstresses and handmaidens;
none of whom he took a fancy to.

<!--
Post hoc ostendit ei omnes filias; has quoque sicut et priores
omnino reppulit atque neglexit.
-->
After this he showed him all of his daughters; and he likewise
altogether rebuffed and disregarded them just as before.

<!--
Habebat autem dominus quandam nobilem puellam in domo sua, quam iam diu
educaverat ut eam acciperet in uxorem; quam et ostendit ei.
-->
Now the host had in his house a certain well-born maiden, whom he had
long raised in order to take her as his wife; he showed her to him
as well.

<!--
Aeger vero, adspecta hac, ait: "Ex hac est mihi mors et in hac est
mihi vita."
-->
In truth when the sick man saw her, he said: "To be away from her is
death to me and to be with her is life to me."

<!--
Quo audito dedit ei puellam nobilem in uxorem cum omnibus quae erat
cum ea accepturus.
-->
When he heard this he gave the well-born maiden to him to wed,
along with everything that he would have received with her.

<!--
Et praeterea dedit ei ea quae erat daturus puellae si eam acciperet
in uxorem.
-->
And in addition he gave him the things that he would have given to the
maiden if he had taken her in marriage.

<!--
His completis, accepta uxore, cum his quae cum uxore acceperat et
negotiatione facta rediit in patriam.
-->
When these things were done, and he had taken her to wife, 
along with the things that he had received with his wife, and
the business completed, he returned to his homeland.

<!--
Contigit autem post haec ut Aegyptiacus omnia sua multis modis
amitteret et pauper effectus cogitavit apud se quod iret Baldach ad
amicum quem ibi habebat, ut sui misereretur.
-->
Now it befell after these events that the Egyptian, who had lost all
his possessions in several ways and become a pauper, thought to
himself that he would go to Babylon to the friend that he had
there, to gain his compassion.
</p> 
 
<p>AJC
<!--
Iter ergo nudus et famelicus arripuit atque Baldach intempestae
noctis silentio pervenit.
-->
And so he took up the journey, naked and starving, and reached
Babylon in the silence of a dark and stormy night.
</p> 
 
<p>AJC
<!--
Pudor autem ei obstabat ne domum amici adiret, ne forte incognitus
tali tempore domo expelleretur.
-->
But bashfulness kept him from going to the house of his friend, for
fear that perchance he would not be recognized at such a time and
would be thrown out of the house.
</p> 
 
<p>AJC
<!--
Templum ergo quoddam antiquum intravit ut ibidem pernoctaret.
-->
And so he entered into an ancient church so he could spend the
night there.
