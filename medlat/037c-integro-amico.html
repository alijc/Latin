<h4>Example II. On the Perfect Friend</h4>
 
<p>
<!--
At pater:  Exemplum II. De integro amico.
-->
And the father said:  Example II. On the perfect friend.

<!--
“Relatum est mihi de duobus negotiatoribus, quorum unus erat in
Aegypto, alter Baldach, seque solo auditu cognoverant et per
internuntios pro sibi necessariis mittebant.
-->
A story was told to me about two merchants, one of whom was in
Egypt, and the other in Babylon, and they knew each other by 
hearsay alone, and would send for what they needed through 
intermediaries.

<!--
Contigit autem ut qui erat Baldach in negotiationem in Aegyptum iret.
-->
Now it happened that the Babylonian went to Egypt for business.

<!--
Aegyptiacus audito eius adventu occurrit ei et suscepit eum gaudens
in domum suam et in omnibus ei servivit sicut mos est amicorum per
octo dies, et ostendit ei omnes manerias cantus quas habebat in domo
sua.
-->
When the Egyptian heard of his arrival he hurried to meet him and 
received him, rejoicing, into his home and served him in everything 
for eight days, as is the custom among friends, and showed him all
sorts of poetry that he had in his house.

<!--
Finitis octo diebus infirmatus est.
-->
At the end of eight days he fell ill.

<!--
Quod valde graviter dominus de amico suo ferens adscivit omnes
medicos Aegyptiacos ut amicum hospitem viderent.
-->
Because of the deep feeling that the host bore towards his friend, 
he brought in all the Egyptian doctors to examine his guest-friend.
 
<!--
Medici vero, palpato pulsu, iterum et iterum urina respecta, nullam
in eo agnoverunt infirmitatem.
-->
Indeed the doctors, after taking his pulse and inspecting his urine
again and again, didn't recognize his illness.
 
<!--
Et quia per hoc nullam corporalem agnovere infirmitatem, amoris
sciunt esse passionem.
-->
And because they discerned no physical illness through this, 
they understood it to be the suffering of love.

<!-- 
Hoc agnito dominus venit ad eum et quaesivit si qua esset mulier in
domo sua quam diligeret.
-->
When his host learned this he went to him and asked if there was a 
woman in his house that he loved.
</p> 
 
<p>AJC
<!-- 
Ad haec aeger: “Ostende mihi omnes domus tuae mulieres, et si forte
inter eas hanc videro, tibi ostendam."
-->
The sick man said to him: "Show me all the women of your house, 
and if perchance I see such a one among them, I'll point her out."
</p> 
 
<p>AJC
<!--
Quo audito ei ostendit cantatrices et pedissequas; quarum nulla ei
complacuit.
-->
Whe he heard this he showed him songstresses and handmaidens;
none of whom he took a fancy to.
</p> 
 
<p>AJC
<!--
Post hoc ostendit ei omnes filias; has quoque sicut et priores
omnino reppulit atque neglexit.
-->
After this he showed him all of his daughters; and he likewise
altogether rebuffed and disregarded them just as before.
