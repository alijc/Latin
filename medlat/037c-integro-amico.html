<!--XXXVIIc Exemplum II. De integro amico.-->
<h4>Example II. On the Perfect Friend</h4>
 
<p>AJC
<!--
At pater:  Exemplum II. De integro amico.
-->
And the father said:  Example II. On the perfect friend.
</p> 
 
<p>AJC
<!--
â€œRelatum est mihi de duobus negotiatoribus, quorum unus erat in
Aegypto, alter Baldach, seque solo auditu cognoverant et per
internuntios pro sibi necessariis mittebant.
-->
Something was related to me about two traders, one of whom was in
Egypt, and the other in Babylon, and they knew each other by 
hearsay alone and would send through intermediaries by necessity 
for themselves.
</p> 
 
<p>AJC
<!--
Contigit autem ut qui erat Baldach in negotiationem in Aegyptum iret.
-->
Now it happened that the Babylonian went to Egypt for business.
</p> 
 
<p>AJC
<!--
Aegyptiacus audito eius adventu occurrit ei et suscepit eum gaudens
in domum suam et in omnibus ei servivit sicut mos est amicorum per
octo dies, et ostendit ei omnes manerias cantus quas habebat in domo
sua.
-->
When the Egyptian heard of his arrival he hurried to meet him and 
received him, rejoicing, into his home and served him in everything 
for eight days, as is the custom among friends, and showed him all
sorts of poetry that he had in his house.
</p> 
 
<p>AJC
<!--
Finitis octo diebus infirmatus est.
-->
At the end of eight days he fell ill.
</p> 
 
<p>AJC
<!--
Quod valde graviter dominus de amico suo ferens adscivit omnes
medicos Aegyptiacos ut amicum hospitem viderent.
-->

</p> 
 
<p>AJC
<!--
.. Medici vero, palpato pulsu, iterum et iterum urina respecta, nullam
in eo agnoverunt infirmitatem.
-->

</p> 
 
<p>AJC
<!--
.. Et quia per hoc nullam corporalem agnovere infirmitatem, amoris
sciunt esse passionem.
