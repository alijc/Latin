<!--XXXVIII De Maimundo Servo-->
<h4>The Servant Maimundus</h4>

<p>
AJC
<!--
Iuvenis senem interrogavit: “Cum invitatus fuero ad
prandium, quid faciam?
-->
A youth asked an old man: “When I am invited to dine, 
what should I do?
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
Parum vel nimis comedam?”
-->
Should I eat only a little food, or a great deal of it?”
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
Cui senex: "Nimis. Quoniam si amicus tuus fuerit qui te invitavit,
multum gaudebit; si autem inimicus, dolebit."
-->
And the old man said to him: "A great deal.  Because if it was your friend who
invited you, he'll be very glad; but it was an enemy, he'll be sorry."
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
Hoc audito risit puer.
-->
When the boy heard this he laughed.
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
Ad quem senex: “Quid rides?”
-->
The old man said to him: "Why do you laugh?"
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
Puer: “Recordatus sum verbi quod audivi de Maimundo nigro.
-->
Boy: “I was reminded of what I heard about black Maimundus.
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
Quidam enim senex quaesivit ab eo quantum posset comedere.
-->
For a certain old man asked him how much he could eat.
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
Cui ipse: 'De cuius prandio, de meo vel de alterius?'
-->
And he said to him: 'From whose meal, mine or someone else's?'
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
At ille: 'De tuo.'
-->
And he said: 'From yours.'
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
Maimundus: 'Quanto minus possum.'
-->
Maimundus: 'As little as I can.'
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
Senex: 'De alterius quantum?'
-->
The old man: 'How much from someone else's?'
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
Maimundus: 'Quanto magis possum.' ”
-->
Maimundus: 'As much as I can.' ”
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
Senex: “Tu modo recordaris verborum cuiusdam gulosi pigri,
stulti, garruli et nugigeruli et quicquid tale de illo dicitur vel
eo amplius in eo invenitur.”
-->
Old man: “You were just reminded of the story of a certain gluttonous, lazy,
stupid, chattering and worthless fool, and whatever is said of such like
about him, even more is invented about him.”
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
Iuvenis: “Multum placet mihi de eo audire, quia quicquid de eo
est, derisorium est.
-->
Youth: “It pleases me a great deal to hear about him, because everything about
him is laughable.
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
Et si quid de eius dictis vel factis mente retines, eloquere, et
habebo pro munere.”
-->
And if you can call to mind anything about his sayings or deeds, please tell me,
   and I will take it as a gift.”
