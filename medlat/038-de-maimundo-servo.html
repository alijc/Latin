<!--XXXVIII De Maimundo Servo-->
<h4>The Servant Maimundus</h4>

<p>
<!--
Iuvenis senem interrogavit: “Cum invitatus fuero ad
prandium, quid faciam?
-->
A youth asked an old man: “When I am invited to dine, 
what should I do?

<!--
Parum vel nimis comedam?”
-->
Should I eat only a little food, or a great deal of it?”
</p>

<p>
<!--
Cui senex: "Nimis. Quoniam si amicus tuus fuerit qui te invitavit,
multum gaudebit; si autem inimicus, dolebit."
-->
And the old man said to him: "A great deal.  Because if it was your friend who
invited you, he'll be very glad; but it was an enemy, he'll be sorry."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Hoc audito risit puer.
-->
When the boy heard this he laughed.

<!--
Ad quem senex: “Quid rides?”
-->
The old man said to him: "Why do you laugh?"
</p>

<p>
<!--
Puer: “Recordatus sum verbi quod audivi de Maimundo nigro.
-->
Boy: “I was reminded of what I heard about black Maimundus.

<!--
Quidam enim senex quaesivit ab eo quantum posset comedere.
-->
For a certain old man asked him how much he could eat.

<!--
Cui ipse: 'De cuius prandio, de meo vel de alterius?'
-->
And he said to him: 'From whose meal, mine or someone else's?'
</p>

<p>
<!--
At ille: 'De tuo.'
-->
And he said: 'From yours.'
</p>

<p>
<!--
Maimundus: 'Quanto minus possum.'
-->
Maimundus: 'As little as I can.'
</p>

<p>
<!--
Senex: 'De alterius quantum?'
-->
The old man: 'How much from someone else's?'
</p>

<p>
<!--
Maimundus: 'Quanto magis possum.' ”
-->
Maimundus: 'As much as I can.' ”
</p>

<p>
<!--
Senex: “Tu modo recordaris verborum cuiusdam gulosi pigri,
stulti, garruli et nugigeruli et quicquid tale de illo dicitur vel
eo amplius in eo invenitur.”
-->
Old man: “You were just reminded of the story of a certain gluttonous, lazy,
stupid, chattering and worthless fool, and whatever is said of such like
about him, even more is invented about him.”
</p>

<p>
<!--
Iuvenis: “Multum placet mihi de eo audire, quia quicquid de eo
est, derisorium est.
-->
Youth: “It pleases me a great deal to hear about him, because everything about
him is laughable.

<!--
Et si quid de eius dictis vel factis mente retines, eloquere, et
habebo pro munere.”
-->
And if you can call to mind anything about his sayings or deeds, please tell me,
   and I will take it as a gift.”
</p>

.. Senex: “Dominus suus praecepit ei quadam nocte ut clauderet ianuam.
-->
Old man: “One night his master ordered him to bar the door.
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
.. Ipse vero desidia pressus surgere non potuit et ideo dixit quia
clausa erat ianua.
-->

In fact he, overwhelmed with laziness, could not bring himself to rise and
therefore said that the door had been barred.

</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
.. Mane autem facto dixit dominus servo: 'Maimunde, aperi ianuam.'
-->
Now when morning came, the master told his servant: 'Maimundus, open the door.' 
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
.. Cui servus: 'Domine, sciebam quod volebas eam hodie esse apertam et
ideo nolui eam sero claudere.'
-->
And the servant told him: 'Master, I knew that you would want it to be opened
today and therefore I didn't want to bar it at a late hour.'
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
.. Tunc primum comperit dominus quod propter pigritiam dimiserat et dixit:
'Surge, fac opus tuum, quia dies est et sol iam altus est.'
-->
That was when the master first realized that he had given up on account of his
laziness. He said: 'Get up and do your work, because it is day and the sun is
already up.'
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
.. Cui servus: “Domine, si sol iam altus est da mihi comedere.'
-->
The servant said: 'Master, if the sun is up then give me food.'
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
.. Cui dominus: 'Pessime serve, vis nocte comedere?'
-->
And his master said: 'Worthless servant, do you want to eat tonight?'
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
.. Servus: 'Si nox est permitte me dormire.'
-->
Servant: 'If it's night then let me sleep.'
</p>

<!--########-->

<p>
AJC
<!--
..  Alia vice dixit dominus servo noctu: 'Maimunde, surge et videas
utrum pluat necne.'
-->
On another night the master said to his servant: 'Maimundus, get up and see
whether or not it is raining.'
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
.. Ipse vero advocavit canem qui iacebat extra ianuam et cum venisset
canis palpavit pedes eius.
-->
But in fact, he called the dog, that was lying outside the door, and after
it came in he felt the dog's feet.
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
.. Quibus inventis siccis domino inquit: 'Domine, non pluit.'
-->
And, after finding that they were dry, said to his master: 'Master, it isn't
raining'. 
</p>

<p>
<!--

</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
. Alia vice dominus interrogavit servum noctu an ignis esset in domo.
-->
On another night the master asked his servant whether there was a fire in the
house. 
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
.. Ipse vero vocato murilego temptavit an calidus esset an non.
-->
In fact he called the cat and felt whether or not it was warm. 
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
.. Et cum invenisset eum frigidum, ait: 'Domine, non.' ”
-->
And when he found it cold, said: 'No, master.'”
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
.. Iuvenis: “Pigritiam audivi; modo garrulitatem eius audire cupio.”
-->
The youth: “I heard about his laziness; but I wish to hear about his
talkativeness.”
