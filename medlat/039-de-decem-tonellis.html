<!--XXXIX De Decem Tonellis Olei-->
<h4>The Ten Casks of Oil</h4>

<p>
<!--
Contigit quod quidam homo habuit filium, cui post mortem suam nihil
praeter domum dimisit.
-->
It happened that a certain man had a son, to whom he left nothing
but a house upon his death.

<!-- 
Iste cum magno labore corpori suo vix etiam quae natura exigit
suppeditabat, et tamen domum suam, licet magna, coactus inedia, vendere nolebat.
--> 
Even with great toil he was scarcely supplying the natural needs of his body, 
and was compelled to fast because he didn't want to sell his house,
though it was large.

<!--
Habebat autem puer iste quendam vicinum valde divitem, qui domum
pueri emere cupiebat ut suam largiorem faceret.
-->
Now this lad had a certain very wealthy neighbor who 
longed to buy the boy's house in order to make his own house larger.

<!--
Puer autem nec prece nec pretio vendere volebat.
-->
But the lad had no wish to sell, for love or money.

<!--
Quod postquam dives ille comperit, quibus ingeniis et quibus
artibus puero subtraheret domum cogitavit.
-->
After this rich man learned this, he pondered on which tricks and 
wiles he might use take it away from the boy.

<!--
At iuvenis secundum posse suum familiaritatem eius devitavit.
-->
But the youth avoided the man's intimacy as well as he could.

<!--
Denique contristatus dives ille causa domus et quod non posset
puerum decipere, quadam die venít ad puerum et inquit ei: “O puer,
accommoda mihi parvam tuae partem curiae pretio, quoniam in ea sub
terra decem tonellos cum oleo custodire volo et nihil tibi nocebunt,
et habebis inde aliquod sustentamentum vitae."
-->
Finally, for the sake of the house, the rich man, discouraged
because he could not deceive the lad, came to the lad one day and said to him:
"Laddie, rent me a small part of your court, because I wish to bury ten casks 
of oil in it, and they will do you no harm, and from this you will have 
some means of supporting your life."
</p>

<!--
Puer autem coactus necessitate concessit et dedit illi claves domus.
-->
Now the lad, forced by necessity, submitted and gave him keys to the house.
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
Iuvenis vero interim more solito liberis liberaliter serviens
victum perquisivit.
-->
Indeed, in the meantime the youth, according to his usual habit, which serves
children so well, searched for provisions everywhere.
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
At dives homo, acceptis clavibus, curiam iuvenis suffodiens quinque
tonellos plenos oleo ibi recondidit et quinque dimidios.
-->
But the rich man, after taking the keys, dug under the youth's courtyard
and hid five casks full of oil there, and five that were half-full.
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
Et hoc facto iuvenem advocavit clavesque domus illi tribuens ait:
“O iuvenis, oleum meum tibi committo atque in tua custodia trado."
-->
And when he'd done this he summoned the youth and presenting him with the 
house keys, said:
"O youth, I entrust my oil to you and surrender it to your safekeeping."
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
Iuvenis simplex, putans omnes tonellos esse plenos, in custodia recepit.
-->
The simple youth, thinking that all the casks were full, accepted the charge.
</p>
