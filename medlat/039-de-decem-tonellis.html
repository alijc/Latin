<!--XXXIX De Decem Tonellis Olei-->
<h4>AJC The Ten Casks of Oil</h4>

AJC
<!--
Contigit quod quidam homo habuit filium, cui post mortem suam nihil
praeter domum dimisit.
-->
It happened that a certain man had a son, to whom he left nothing
but a house upon his death.
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!-- 
Iste cum magno labore corpori suo vix etiam quae natura exigit
suppeditabat, et tamen domum suam, licet magna, coactus inedia, vendere nolebat.
--> 
Even with great toil he was scarcely supplying the natural needs of his body, 
and was compelled to fast because he didn't want to sell his house,
though it was large.
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
Habebat autem puer iste quendam vicinum valde divitem, qui domum
pueri emere cupiebat ut suam largiorem faceret.
-->
Now this lad had a certain very wealthy neighbor who 
longed to buy the boy's house in order to make his own house larger.
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
Puer autem nec prece nec pretio vendere volebat.
-->
But the lad had no wish to sell, for love or money.
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
Quod postquam dives ille comperit, quibus ingeniis et quibus
artibus puero subtraheret domum cogitavit.
-->
After this rich man learned this, he pondered on which tricks and 
wiles he might use take it away from the boy.
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
At iuvenis secundum posse suum familiaritatem eius devitavit.
-->
But the youth avoided the man's intimacy as well as he could.
