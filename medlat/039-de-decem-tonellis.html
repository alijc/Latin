<!--XXXIX De Decem Tonellis Olei-->
<h4>The Ten Casks of Oil</h4>

<p>
<!--
Contigit quod quidam homo habuit filium, cui post mortem suam nihil
praeter domum dimisit.
-->
It happened that a certain man had a son, to whom he left nothing
but a house upon his death.

<!-- 
Iste cum magno labore corpori suo vix etiam quae natura exigit
suppeditabat, et tamen domum suam, licet magna, coactus inedia, vendere nolebat.
--> 
Even with great toil he was scarcely supplying the natural needs of his body, 
and was compelled to fast because he didn't want to sell his house,
though it was large.

<!--
Habebat autem puer iste quendam vicinum valde divitem, qui domum
pueri emere cupiebat ut suam largiorem faceret.
-->
Now this lad had a certain very wealthy neighbor who 
longed to buy the boy's house in order to make his own house larger.

<!--
Puer autem nec prece nec pretio vendere volebat.
-->
But the lad had no wish to sell, for love or money.

<!--
Quod postquam dives ille comperit, quibus ingeniis et quibus
artibus puero subtraheret domum cogitavit.
-->
After this rich man learned this, he pondered on which tricks and 
wiles he might use take it away from the boy.

<!--
At iuvenis secundum posse suum familiaritatem eius devitavit.
-->
But the youth avoided the man's intimacy as well as he could.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Denique contristatus dives ille causa domus et quod non posset
puerum decipere, quadam die venít ad puerum et inquit ei: “O puer,
accommoda mihi parvam tuae partem curiae pretio, quoniam in ea sub
terra decem tonellos cum oleo custodire volo et nihil tibi nocebunt,
et habebis inde aliquod sustentamentum vitae."
-->
Finally, for the sake of the house, the rich man, discouraged
because he could not deceive the lad, came to the lad one day and said to him:
"Laddie, rent me a small part of your court, because I wish to bury ten casks 
of oil in it, and they will do you no harm, and from this you will have 
some means of supporting your life."

<!--
Puer autem coactus necessitate concessit et dedit illi claves domus.
-->
Now the lad, forced by necessity, submitted and gave him keys to the house.

<!--
Iuvenis vero interim more solito liberis liberaliter serviens
victum perquisivit.
-->
Indeed, in the meantime the youth, according to his usual habit, which serves
children so well, searched for provisions everywhere.

<!--
At dives homo, acceptis clavibus, curiam iuvenis suffodiens quinque
tonellos plenos oleo ibi recondidit et quinque dimidios.
-->
But the rich man, after taking the keys, dug under the youth's courtyard
and hid five casks full of oil there, and five that were half-full.

<!--
Et hoc facto iuvenem advocavit clavesque domus illi tribuens ait:
“O iuvenis, oleum meum tibi committo atque in tua custodia trado."
-->
And when he'd done this he summoned the youth and presenting him with the 
house keys, said:
"O youth, I entrust my oil to you and surrender it to your safekeeping."

<!--
Iuvenis simplex, putans omnes tonellos esse plenos, in custodia recepit.
-->
The simple youth, thinking that all the casks were full, accepted the charge.
</p>

<p>
<!--
At post longum tempus contigit quod in terra illa oleum carum fuit.
-->
Now a long time later it happened that in that country oil became costly.

<!--
Dives hoc videns puero inquit: “O amice, veni et iuva me oleum
effodere quod tuae iam dudum mandavi custodiae et laboris praemium
accipies et tutelae."
-->
On seeing this the rich man said to the lad: "Friend, come and help me
dig out the oil that I lately committed to your charge, and you will receive
the reward for your labor and guardianship."

<!--
Iuvenis, audita prece cum pretio, diviti concessit ut secundum
posse suum eum iuvaret.
-->
The youth, when he heard the request, and the payment, allowed to the rich man
that he would help him as much as he could.

<!--
Dives vero non oblitus fraudis suae nequissimae adduxit homines ut
oleum emerent.
-->
And so the rich man, who hadn't forgotten about his most wretched deceit, 
brought men to buy the oil.

<!--
Quibus adductis terram aperuerunt et quinque plenos tonellos et
quinque dimidios invenerunt.
-->
And after bringing them, he excavated the ground and found five full barrels 
and five that were half-full.

<!--
Perceptis talibus advocavit puerum ita dicendo: “Amice, causa tuae
custodiae amisi oleum; insuper quod tibi commisi fraudulenter
abstulisti.
-->
When he perceived this he summoned the lad, saying thus: 'Friend, 
due to your safe-keeping I have lost oil; in addition you have fraudulently 
stolen what I entrusted to you.

<!--
Quapropter volo ut mea mihi restituas."
-->
Therefore I want you to make it good.'

<!--
His dictis eum accepit et, vellet nollet, ad iustitiam deduxit.
-->
Having said this he seized him and, willing or not, led him to the justice.

<!--
Iustitia eum videns accusavit, sed iuvenis quid contra diceret nescivit.
-->
When the justice saw him he charged him, but the youth didn't know what
to say in reply.

<!--
Sed tamen indutias unius diei quaesivit.
-->
But he nevertheless asked for a day of grace.

<!--
Quod iustitia, quia iustum erat, concessit.
-->
Which the justice, because he was just, granted.
</p>

<p>
<!--
In civitate autem illa morabatur quidem philosophus, qui
cognominabatur Auxilium Egentium, bonus homo atque religiosus.
-->
Now there resided in that town a certain philosopher, who
went by the name of Aid to the Needy, a good man and a religious one.

<!--
Iuvenis autem, audito bonitatis illius praeconio, perrexit ad eum
quaesivitque ab eo consilium dicens: “Si vera sunt quae multis
referentibus de te mihi dicta sunt, more domestico fer mihi auxilium;
etenim iniuste accusor.”
-->
Now the young man, having heard praise for this man's integrity,
went to him and asked him for advise, saying: "If the things that
many people have told me about you are true, bring me aid in your own way:
because I am unjustly accused."

<!--
Philosophus, audita prece iuvenis, interrogavit si iuste vel
iniuste accusarent eum.
-->
The philosopher, when he heard the young man's plea, asked if they 
were accusing him justly or unjustly.

<!--
Iuvenis vero quod iniuste accusaretur firmavit sacramento.
-->
Indeed the youth confirmed by oath that he was unjustly accused.

<!--
Audita rei sinceritate, philosophus pietate commotus ait:
“Auxiliante Deo feram tibi auxilium; sed sicut a iustitia respectum
usque in crastinum diem accepisti, quin eas ad placita dimittere noli,
et ero ibi paratus succurrere tuae veritati atque eorum nocere
falsitati."
-->
When he'd heard the straightforwardness of the matter, the philosopher, 
moved with pity, said:  "God willing, I will bring you aid; but as
you have received a postponement from the justice until tomorrow, 
do not fail to go to make your plea, and I will be there, ready to 
help your truthfulness and to harm their falsehood."

<!--
Iuvenis autem quod philosophus ei iusserat egit.
-->
And so the youth did what the philosopher had commanded him to do.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Mane autem facto venit philosophus ad iustitiam.
-->
Now when morning had come the philosopher went to the justice.

<!--
Quem postquam vidit iustitia, ut sapientem et philosophum vocavit
vocatumque iuxta se sedere fecit.
-->
As soon as the justice saw him, he summoned the wise man and philosopher
and called on him to sit very close by.

<!--
Inde iustitia vocavit accusantem et accusatum et praecepit quod
suorum recordarentur placitorum; et ita fecerunt.
-->
Then the justice summoned the accuser and the accused and instructed
them to think over their pleas; and so they did.

<!--
Illis vero sic coram adstantibus, iustitia ait philosopho quod
causas eorum audiret et inde iudicium faceret.
-->
Since he had stood up for truth so in their presence, the justice
told the philosopher that he'd hear their pleas and then make a judgment.

<!--
Inde philosophus: “Praecipe nunc, iustitia, clarum oleum de quinque
tonellis plenis mensurari et scias quantum sit ibi clari olei; et
similiter de quinque dimidiis, et scias quantum clari olei ibi fuerit.
-->
Then the philosopher said: "Justice, now order that the light oil from
the five full casks be measured, so that you might know how much light
oil was there; and similarly of the five half-full ones, so that
you might know how much light oil was there.
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
Deinde spissum oleum de quinque plenis tonellis sit mensuratum et
scias quantum spissi olei fuerit ibi; et similiter de quinque dimidiis
facias mensurari et scias quantum spissi olei in eis sit.
-->
Then let the thick oil from the five full casks be measured so that
you might know how much thick oil was there: and similarly, cause it
to be measured from the five half-full ones, so that you might know
how much thick oil was in them.
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
Et si tantum spissi olei inveneris in dimidiis tonellis quantum et
in plenis, scias oleum fuisse furatum.
-->
And if you find as much thick oil in the half-full casks as in the
full ones, you will know that the oil was stolen.
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
Et si in dimidiis tonellis inveneris talem partem spissitudinis
qualem oleum clarum ibi existens exigit, quod quidem et in plenis
tonellis invenire poteris, scias oleum non fuisse furatum."
-->
And if you find the same proportion of light and thick oil in the
half-full casks as you find in the full casks, you will know that the
oil was not stolen."
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
Iustitia haec audiens confirmavit iudicium factumque est ita.
-->
The justice, on hearing these words, declared a judgement, and so it
was done.
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
Et hoc modo iuvenis evasit sensu philosophi.
-->
And in this way the youth escaped, through the perception of the philosopher.
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
Finitis placitis iuvenis philosopho grates reddidit.
-->
The youth, pleased as punch, rendered his thanks to the philosopher.
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
Tunc philosophus ait illi: “Numquamne illud philosophi audisti,
'non emas domum, antequam cognoscas vicinum'?' ”
-->
Then the philosopher said to him: "Did you never hear the wise saying,
'you shouldn't buy a house before you get to know your neighbor?'"
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
Ad haec iuvenis: “Primum habuimus domum, antequam iuxta nos hospitaretur."
-->
The youth said to him: "We owned the house first, before he lodged next-door."
</p>

<p>
AJC
<!--
Cui philosophus: “Primum vendas domum quam maneas iuxta malum vicinum."
-->
And the philosopher said to him: "You should sooner sell the house
than stay next to a bad neighbor."
