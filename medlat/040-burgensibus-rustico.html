<!--XL DE DUOBUS BURGENSIBUS ET RUSTICO-->
<h4>Two City Slickers and a Yokel</h4>

<p>
<!--
Arabs castigavit filium suum: 
"Fili, si fueris in via cum aliquo socio, 
dilige eum sicut te ipsum et non mediteris aliquem decipere, 
ne et tu decipiaris, veluti duobus contigit burgensibus et rustico."
-->
An Arab admonished his son: 
"Son, if you are on the road with a companion, 
value him as much as yourself and make no plans to deceive him,
lest you are likewise deceived, 
as happened to two city slickers and a country yokel."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Filius: “Pater, refer mihi, ut aliquid utilitatis inde capiant posteri."
-->
The son said, "Father, tell me, so that our descendents might get some
use from the tale."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Pater: “Dictum fuit de duobus burgensibus et rustico, 
causa orationis Mech adeuntibus, 
quod essent socii victus donec venirent prope Mech, 
et tunc defecit illis cibus ita quod non remansit eis
quicquam nisi tantum farinae qua solum panem et parvum facerent.
-->
The father said, “This was told about two city slickers and a country yokel,
on the occasion of a visit to Mecca,
because they were messmates until they got nearly to Mecca,
and then they ran short of food so that they barely had
enough flour to make one small loaf of bread.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Burgenses vero hoc videntes dixerunt ad invicem:
'Parum panis habemus et noster multum comedit socius.
-->
The city slickers, when they saw this, said to each other:
'We don't have enough bread and our companion eats too much.

<!--
Quapropter oportet nos habere consilium quomodo sibi partem panis
auferre possimus et quod nobiscum debet, soli comedamus.'
-->
Therefore, let us make a plan on how we can carry off
part of the bread for ourselves, as is our due,
so that we alone could eat it.'
</p>

<p>
<!--
Deinde acceperunt consilium huiuscemodi quod facerent panem 
et coquerent et dum coqueretur dormirent et quisquis eorum mirabiliora
somniando videret, solus panem comederet.
-->
Then they made a plan of this sort, that they would make a loaf of bread
and bake it and sleep while it was baking and whichever of them
saw marvels in his dreams, he alone would eat the loaf.

<!--
Hoc artificiose dicebant quia rusticum simplicem ad huiusmodi
ficticia deputabant.
-->
They said this craftily, for they regarded the yokel as gullible
to this sort of trick.

<!--
Et fecerunt panem miseruntque in ignem, deinde iacuerunt ut dormirent.
-->
And they made a loaf and put it in the fire, then lay down to sleep.

<!--
At rusticus percepta eorum astutia, dormientibus sociis, de igne
extraxit panem semicoctum et comedit et iterum iacuit.
-->
But the yokel saw through their trick and pulled the half-baked bread out of
the fire while his companions were sleeping and ate it and lay back down.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Sed unus de burgensibus, sicut somno perterritus esset, 
evigilavit sociumque vocavit.
-->
But one of the city slickers, as if he was frightened in his sleep, 
woke up and called his companion.

<!--
Cui alter de burgensibus ait: 'Quíd habes?'
-->
And the other city slicker said to him: 'What's wrong?'
</p>

<p>
<!--
At ille ínquit: 'Mirabile somnium vidi; nam mihi visum erat quod
duo angeli aperiebant portas caeli et me sumentes ante Deum ducebant.'
-->
But he said: 'I've had a marvelous dream; for it seemed to me that two angels
opened the gates of heaven and picked me up and led me before God.' 
</p>

<p>
<!--
Cui socíus: 'Mirabile est, hoc somnium quod vidisti.
-->
And his companion said to him: 'It is a marvel, this dream that you had.

<!--
At ego somniavi quod ego, duobus angelis ducentibus et terram findentibus, 
ducerer in infernum.'
-->
But I dreamt that I, with two angels leading me and splitting earth open,
was led into hell.'
</p>

<p>
<!--
Rusticus vero hoc totum audiebat et tamen se dormire fingebat.
-->
In truth, the yokel heard all this and yet feigned sleep.

<!--
Sed burgenses, decepti et decipere volentes, 
ut evigilaret rustícum vocaverunt.
-->
But the city slickers, cheated and willing to cheat,
called the yokel to wake him. 
</p>

<p>
<!--
Rusticus vero callide et sicut territus esset respondit: 
'Qui sunt qui me vocant?'
-->
Indeed, the yokel replied, cleverly and as if he were frightened:
'Who is it that's calling me?'
</p>

<p>
<!--
At illi: “Socii tui sumus.'
-->
But they said: 'We are your companions.'
</p>

<p>
<!--
Et rusticus: 'Rediistis iam?'
-->
And the yokel said: 'Are you back already?'
</p>

<p>
<!--
At ipsi contra: 'Quo perreximus unde redire debeamus?'
-->
But they countered: 'Where did we go that we needed to come back from there?'
</p>

<p>
<!--
Ad haec rusticus: 'Nunc visum erat mihi quod duo angeli unum ex
vobis accipiebant et aperiebant portas caeli ducebantque ante Deum;
deinde alium accipiebant duo alii angeli et aperta terra ducebant in
infernum.
-->
The yokel said to them: 'Now it seemed to me that two angels took one
of you and opened the gates of heaven and led him before God;
then two other angels took the other and, having opened the earth,
led him into hell.

<!--
Et his visis putavi neminem vestrum iam amplius rediturum et
surrexi et panem comedi.'"
-->
And, having seen this, I thought that neither of you would be ever coming back
and got up and ate the bread.'“
</p>

<p>
<!--
Et pater: “O fili, sic evenit eis qui socium decipere voluerunt,
quia suo ingenio decepti fuerunt."
-->
And the father said: "Son, it happens thus to those who wish to cheat their
companion, because they will be cheated by their own nature."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Tunc filíus: “Ita evenit eis, sicut in proverbio dictum est: 
'Qui totum voluit, totum perdidit.'
-->
Then the son said: "So it happened to them, as has been said in the proverb:
'He who wants it all, loses it all.'
