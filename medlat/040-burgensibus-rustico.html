<!--XL DE DUOBUS BURGENSIBUS ET RUSTICO-->
<h4>Two City Slickers and a Yokel</h4>

<p>
<!--
Arabs castigavit filium suum: 
"Fili, si fueris in via cum aliquo socio, 
dilige eum sicut te ipsum et non mediteris aliquem decipere, 
ne et tu decipiaris, veluti duobus contigit burgensibus et rustico."
-->
An Arab admonished his son: 
"Son, if you are on the road with a companion, 
value him as much as yourself and make no plans to deceive him,
lest you are likewise deceived, 
as happened to two city slickers and a country yokel."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Filius: “Pater, refer mihi, ut aliquid utilitatis inde capiant posteri."
-->
The son said, "Father, tell me, so that our descendents might get some
use from the tale."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Pater: “Dictum fuit de duobus burgensibus et rustico, 
causa orationis Mech adeuntibus, 
quod essent socii victus donec venirent prope Mech, 
et tunc defecit illis cibus ita quod non remansit eis
quicquam nisi tantum farinae qua solum panem et parvum facerent.
-->
The father said, “This was told about two city slickers and a country yokel,
on the occasion of a visit to Mecca,
because they were messmates until they got nearly to Mecca,
and then they ran short of food so that they barely had
enough flour to make one small loaf of bread.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Burgenses vero hoc videntes dixerunt ad invicem:
'Parum panis habemus et noster multum comedit socius.
-->
The city slickers, when they saw this, said to each other:
'We don't have enough bread and our companion eats too much.

<!--
Quapropter oportet nos habere consilium quomodo sibi partem panis
auferre possimus et quod nobiscum debet, soli comedamus.'
-->
Therefore, let us make a plan on how we can carry off
part of the bread for ourselves, as is our due,
so that we alone could eat it.'
</p>

<p>
<!--
Deinde acceperunt consilium huiuscemodi quod facerent panem 
et coquerent et dum coqueretur dormirent et quisquis eorum mirabiliora
somniando videret, solus panem comederet.
-->
Then they made a plan of this sort, that they would make a loaf of bread
and bake it and sleep while it was baking and whichever of them
saw marvels in his dreams, he alone would eat the loaf.

<!--
Hoc artificiose dicebant quia rusticum simplicem ad huiusmodi
ficticia deputabant.
-->
They said this craftily, for they regarded the yokel as gullible
to this sort of trick.

<!--
Et fecerunt panem miseruntque in ignem, deinde iacuerunt ut dormirent.
-->
And they made a loaf and put it in the fire, then lay down to sleep.

<!--
At rusticus percepta eorum astutia, dormientibus sociis, de igne
extraxit panem semicoctum et comedit et iterum iacuit.
-->
But the yokel saw through their trick and pulled the half-baked bread out of
the fire while his companions were sleeping and ate it and lay back down.
