<!--XL DE DUOBUS BURGENSIBUS ET RUSTICO-->
<h4>Two City Slickers and a Yokel</h4>

<p>
<!--
Arabs castigavit filium suum: 
"Fili, si fueris in via cum aliquo socio, 
dilige eum sicut te ipsum et non mediteris aliquem decipere, 
ne et tu decipiaris, veluti duobus contigit burgensibus et rustico."
-->
An Arab admonished his son: 
"Son, if you are on the road with a companion, 
value him as much as yourself and make no plans to deceive him,
lest you are likewise deceived, 
as happened to two city slickers and a country yokel."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Filius: “Pater, refer mihi, ut aliquid utilitatis inde capiant posteri."
-->
The son said, "Father, tell me, so that our descendents might get some
use from the tale."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Pater: “Dictum fuit de duobus burgensibus et rustico, 
causa orationis Mech adeuntibus, 
quod essent socii victus donec venirent prope Mech, 
et tunc defecit illis cibus ita quod non remansit eis
quicquam nisi tantum farinae qua solum panem et parvum facerent.
-->
The father said, “This was told about two city slickers and a country yokel,
on the occasion of a visit to Mecca,
because they were messmates until they got nearly to Mecca,
and then they ran short of food so that they barely had
enough flour to make one small loaf of bread.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Burgenses vero hoc videntes dixerunt ad invicem:
'Parum panis habemus et noster multum comedit socius.
-->
The city slickers, when they saw this, said to each other:
'We don't have enough bread and our companion eats too much.

<!--
Quapropter oportet nos habere consilium quomodo sibi partem panis
auferre possimus et quod nobiscum debet, soli comedamus.'
-->
Therefore, let us make a plan on how we can carry off
part of the bread for ourselves, as is our due,
so that we alone could eat it.'
</p>

<p>
<!--
Deinde acceperunt consilium huiuscemodi quod facerent panem 
et coquerent et dum coqueretur dormirent et quisquis eorum mirabiliora
somniando videret, solus panem comederet.
-->
Then they made a plan of this sort, that they would make a loaf of bread
and bake it and sleep while it was baking and whichever of them
saw marvels in his dreams, he alone would eat the loaf.

<!--
Hoc artificiose dicebant quia rusticum simplicem ad huiusmodi
ficticia deputabant.
-->
They said this craftily, for they regarded the yokel as gullible
to this sort of trick.

<!--
Et fecerunt panem miseruntque in ignem, deinde iacuerunt ut dormirent.
-->
And they made a loaf and put it in the fire, then lay down to sleep.

<!--
At rusticus percepta eorum astutia, dormientibus sociis, de igne
extraxit panem semicoctum et comedit et iterum iacuit.
-->
But the yokel saw through their trick and pulled the half-baked bread out of
the fire while his companions were sleeping and ate it and lay back down.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Sed unus de burgensibus, sicut somno perterritus esset, 
evigilavit sociumque vocavit.
-->
But one of the city slickers, as if he was frightened in his sleep, 
woke up and called his companion.

<!--
Cui alter de burgensibus ait: 'Quíd habes?'
-->
And the other city slicker said to him: 'What's wrong?'
</p>

<p>
<!--
At ille ínquit: 'Mirabile somnium vidi; nam mihi visum erat quod
duo angeli aperiebant portas caeli et me sumentes ante Deum ducebant.'
-->
But he said: 'I've had a marvelous dream; for it seemed to me that two angels
opened the gates of heaven and picked me up and led me before God.' 
</p>

<p>
<!--
Cui socíus: 'Mirabile est, hoc somnium quod vidisti.
-->
And his companion said to him: 'It is a marvel, this dream that you had.

<!--
At ego somniavi quod ego, duobus angelis ducentibus et terram findentibus, 
ducerer in infernum.'
-->
But I dreamt that I, with two angels leading me and splitting earth open,
was led into hell.'
</p>

<p>
<!--
Rusticus vero hoc totum audiebat et tamen se dormire fingebat.
-->
In truth, the yokel heard all this and yet feigned sleep.

<!--
Sed burgenses, decepti et decipere volentes, 
ut evigilaret rustícum vocaverunt.
-->
But the city slickers, cheated and willing to cheat,
called the yokel to wake him. 
</p>

<p>
<!--
Rusticus vero callide et sicut territus esset respondit: 
'Qui sunt qui me vocant?'
-->
Indeed, the yokel replied, cleverly and as if he were frightened:
'Who is it that's calling me?'
</p>

<p>
<!--
At illi: “Socii tui sumus.'
-->
But they said: 'We are your companions.'
</p>

<p>
<!--
Et rusticus: 'Rediistis iam?'
-->
And the yokel said: 'Are you back already?'
</p>

<p>
<!--
At ipsi contra: 'Quo perreximus unde redire debeamus?'
-->
But they countered: 'Where did we go that we needed to come back from there?'
</p>

<p>
<!--
Ad haec rusticus: 'Nunc visum erat mihi quod duo angeli unum ex
vobis accipiebant et aperiebant portas caeli ducebantque ante Deum;
deinde alium accipiebant duo alii angeli et aperta terra ducebant in
infernum.
-->
The yokel said to them: 'Now it seemed to me that two angels took one
of you and opened the gates of heaven and led him before God;
then two other angels took the other and, having opened the earth,
led him into hell.

<!--
Et his visis putavi neminem vestrum iam amplius rediturum et
surrexi et panem comedi.'"
-->
And, having seen this, I thought that neither of you would be ever coming back
and got up and ate the bread.'“
</p>

<p>
<!--
Et pater: “O fili, sic evenit eis qui socium decipere voluerunt,
quia suo ingenio decepti fuerunt."
-->
And the father said: "Son, it happens thus to those who wish to cheat their
companion, because they will be cheated by their own nature."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Tunc filíus: “Ita evenit eis, sicut in proverbio dictum est: 
'Qui totum voluit, totum perdidit.'
-->
Then the son said: "So it happened to them, as has been said in the proverb:
'He who wants it all, loses it all.'

<!--
Haec autem natura est canis, cui faverunt illi, quorum unus alii
cibum auferre cupit.
-->
But it's a dog's nature that they favor, and one of them
wants to snatch the other's food away.

<!--
Sed si naturam cameli sequerentur, mitiorem naturam imitarentur.
-->
But if they had striven for the nature of a camel, they'd have
taken on a milder nature.

<!--
Nam talis est natura cameli: quando insimul datur praebenda multis,
quod nullus eorum comedet, donec omnes insimul edant; et si unus ita
infirmatur quod nequeat comedere, donec removeatur alii ieiunabunt.
-->
For such is the nature of a camel: when food is given to many of them,
none of them eats, unless all eat at the same time;
and if one is so sick that it cannot eat, 
the others will fast until that one is removed.

<!--
Et isti burgenses postquam volebant animalis naturam sibi assumere,
mitissimi animalis naturam sibi debuissent vindicare; et merito cibum
amiserunt.
-->
And those city slickers, when they wished to assume the nature of an animal,
they ought to have claimed the nature of the mildest animal; 
and they deservedly lost the food.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quin etiam hoc eis evenisse voluissem, quod magistro meo narrante
iam dudum audivi evenisse incisori regis pro discipulo suo Nedui,
videlicet quod fustibus caederentur.“
-->
Moreover, we would have wished this to have happened to them,
which I have recently heard of from my teacher's account,
that happened to the king's tailors on account of their apprentice Nedui,
because they were clearly beaten with a club."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Pater ad haec: “Dic mihi, fili, quid audisti?
-->
The father said to him: "Tell me, son, what have you heard?

<!--
Quomodo contigit discipulo, quoniam talis narratio animi erit, recreatio?”
-->
What befell the apprentice? For such a story will be a refreshment for the mind."
</p>

<p>
<!--
“Narravit mihi magister meus quendam regem habuisse unum incisorem
qui diversos diversis aptos temporibus ei incidebat pannos.
-->
"My teacher told me that a certain king had a tailor
who used to cut different clothes suitible for different occasions.

<!--
At ille discipulos sutores habebat, quorum quisquis artificiose
suebat quod magister incisor regis artificiose scindebat.
-->
Now he had apprentices, any of whom would skillfully sew
what the master tailor skillfully cut out for the king.

<!--
Inter quos discipulos unus erat nomine Nedui, qui socios arte
sutoria superabat.
-->
Among the apprentices was one called Nedui, who used to surpass
his fellows in the art of sewing.

<!--
Sed, die festo veniente, rex suorum ad se incisorem pannorum
vocavit et pro tempore pretiosas vestes sibi et suis familiaribus
parari praecepit.
-->
Now there was a feast day coming up, and the king summoned his tailor
and ordered costly garments to be made for him and for his household 
for the occasion.

<!--
Quod ut citius et sine impedimento fieret, unum de camerariis suis
eunuchum, cuius illud erat officium, sutoribus custodem addidit et ut
eorum curvos ungues observaret et eis ad sufficientiam necessaria
ministraret, rogavit.
-->
In order for it be done more quickly and without impediment,
he added a eunuch from among the chamberlains, whose duty it was,
as a guard for the tailors and asked him
to watch their thieving claws
and to furnish them with enough of what they needed.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Sed in una dierum ministri calidum panem et mel cum aliis ferculis
incisori et consociis comedendum dederunt. ///"
-->
Now one days the servants gave the tailor and his associates a meal of 
a loaf of bread, hot out of the oven, and honey with other dishes.

<!--
Et qui aderant comedere coeperunt.
-->
And those who were there began to eat.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quibus epulantibus ait eunuchus: 'Magister, quare Nedui absente
comeditis nec illum expectatis?'
-->
While they were dining the eunuch said to them: 'Master, why,
since Nedui is not here, do you eat and not wait for him?'
</p>

<p>
<!--
Magister inquit: 'Quia mel non comederet, etiamsi adesset.'
-->
The master said: 'Because he wouldn't eat honey, even if he were here.'
</p>

<p>
<!--
Et comederunt.
-->
And they ate it up.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Deinde venit Nedui et ait: 'Quare me absente comedistis nec partem
meam mihi reservastis?'
-->
Then Nedui showed up and said: 'Why, since I was not here, did you eat
and not save my share for me?'
</p>

<p>
<!--
Cui eunuchus: “Magister tuus dixit quod mel non comederes, etiamsi adesses.'
-->
And the eunuch said to him: 'Your master said that you wouldn't eat honey
even if you were here.'
</p>

<p>
<!--
At ille tacuit et quomodo illud magistro suo recompensare posset cogitavit.
-->
And he kept quiet and thought about how he could repay his master for that.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Et hoc facto, magistro absente, secreto dixit eunucho: 'Domine,
magister meus quandoque frenesim patiens sensum perdit, 
et indiscrete circumstantes verberat atque interimit.'
-->
And after this, when the master was away, he told the eunuch, in private:
'Lord, my master, suffering from madness, sometimes loses his wits, 
and indiscriminately lashes out at bystanders and kills them.'
</p>

<p>
<!--
Cui eunuchus: 'Si scirem horam quando ei hoc contigit, 
ne quid inconsulte ageret, ligarem et loris corrigerem.'
-->
And the eunuch said to him: 'If I knew the hour when this happens to him,
I could  tie him up and reform him with whips, to keep him from acting rashly.
</p>

<p>
<!--
At Nedui ait: 'Cum videris illum huc et illuc aspicientem terramque
manibus verberantem atque sua sede surgentem et
scamnum super quod sedet manibus rapientem, tunc eum scias insanum
esse, et nisi tibi et tuis provideris caput fuste dolabit.'
-->
And Nedui said: 'When you see him looking here and there and
beating the ground with his hands, rising from his seat and carrying the stool 
that he was sitting on in his hands, then you'll know 
that he's mad, and unless you provide for you and yours
he will cudgel your head with a club.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Ad haec eunuchus: “Tu benedicaris quia ammodo mihi et meis providebo.'
-->
The eunuch replied to this: 'Blessings upon you,
 for from now on I will watch out for me and mine.' 
</p>
