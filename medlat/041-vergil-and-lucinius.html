<h4>Vergil and Lucinius</h4>
 
<!--
Florebat per idem tempus Romae ille famosissimus poeta Virgilius,
qui de Manthua, Siciliae civitate, oriundus optime notus erat regi,
quia et saepe fuerat ab eo muneribus honoratus.
-->
There flourished at the same time in Rome that most renowned poet, Virgil,
who was from Mantua, a Sicilian city and was quite well known to
the king, for he had often been honored by him with gifts.

<!--
Huic ergo ob notitiam sui et quia tunc temporis inter philosophos
praecipuus habebatur, cum muneribus magnis pater transmittit filium
obsecrans eum per deos suos quatenus puerum et scientia sua instrueret
et a malignorum insidiis diligentius custodiret.
-->
Therefore, on account of his fame and because he was 
held as distinguished among philosophers of that time,
a father sent his son to him with great gifts, entreating him by his gods
that he both instruct the boy with his knowledge
and most carefully protect him from spiteful treachery.

<!--
Timebat enim pater ne aliquid sinistri per invidiam pateretur, quia
hoc a divinis et astrorum peritis acceperat.
-->
For the father feared that the son might suffer something sinister through
hatred, for he had learned this from prophets and from those expert in
astrology. 

<!--
At Virgilius, ob reverentiam et amicitiam regis puerum recipiens,
primo quidem ei litterarum tradidit elementa ac deinde blandiendo
leniendoque, ut moris est magistrorum, syllabam ex litteris conficere
et ex syllabis formare dictionem et ex dictionibus vero perficere
orationem eum in angustia temporis perdocuit.
-->
Now
Virgil, taking the boy in because of the respect and friendship of the king, 
in fact first instructed him in the rudiments of the letters and then,
coaxing and cajoling, as is the custom of teachers,
he throroughly taught him, within a narrow space of time,
to construct a syllable from letters,
and to form a sentence from syllables, 
and from sentences to actually complete an oration.
</p>

<p>
<!-- 
Sicque paulatim proficiens puer iam per se et legere et utramque
linguam, Graecam videlicet et Latinam proferre coepit.
-->
And so, with the boy now gradually making headway through his own efforts,
he began to both read and speak both languages, namely Greek and Latin.

<!--
Laetabatur Virgilius et tantam in puero velocitatem ingenii
mirabatur spemque de eo concipiens meliorem, ampliorem ei curam
impendebat.
-->
Vergil was delighted and marvelled at such a speed of talent in the boy
and conceived a better hope about him, expended a greater care for him.

<!--
Puer vero animum dictis magistri accommodans,
qui naturaliter elegantis erat ingenii,
quicquid semel audisset, subtili statim ingenio
intellectum vivaci memoriae commendabat, 
nec opus erat ei secundo super hoc requirere praeceptorem.
-->
Indeed the boy applied his mind to the words of his teacher,
who was of a naturally discriminating character,
and whatever he heard once, he immediately 
comprehended and committed every strict detail to memory,
and there was no need for him to ask his teacher again.

<!--
Unde factum est ut infra unius anni circulum consocios suos, qui
eum et aetate praecedebant iamque quinquennio vel septennio sub
disciplina fuerant magistrorum, transcenderet rogaretque Virgilium
quatenus eum altioribus instruere dignaretur.
-->
From which it happened that within the circuit of a single year 
he surpassed his companions, who were older than he,
and preceded him by five, or even seven, years
under the education of the teachers,
and he asked Vergil to instruct him 
in deeper matters, as far as he deemed him worthy.

<!--
Ipse vero videns in eo infanti abolitam ruditatem iamque habilem
fore ad percipiendam artium disciplinam, eius libenter annuit
voluntati.
-->
Indeed Vergil, seeing a child's ignorance dispelled in him, and that he was 
already fit to be gaining sound instruction, willingly assented to
the boy's desire.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Ob dilectionem igitur ipsius earundem artium liberalium immensam
prolixitatem in tantam brevitatem quadam mirabili et ineffabili
subtilitate
contraxit ingenii, ut eas intra libelluli manualis compendium
concluderet possetque eas quivis in tribus annis facile ad perfectum
addiscere quas ipse vix cum magno etiam sudore percipere valuisset.
-->
Therefore, on account of his esteem, he condensed,
with a certain wonderful and ineffable innate logic,
an immense body of works of the liberal arts  with such conciseness
that they fit in a handbook,
and that anyone could easily learn to perfection in three years
the things that he himself had prevailed upon only with a great deal of sweat.

<!--
Hunc autem libellum nulli umquam vel hora una concedere voluit, non
magistro, non discipulo, sed nec ipsi principi orbis Augusto nisi
tantum Lucinio cuius profectui incumbebat.
-->
But he was unwilling to relinquish this book to anyone for even an hour,
not to a teacher, or a student, not even to the emperor of the world,
Augustus himself, excepting only to Lucinius whose progress he was urging on.

<!--
Huic ad cuius utilitatem ipsum ediderat, tradidit eundem, ei in
conclavi et seorsum ab aliis in eodem de artibus amicabiliter
disserens.
-->
To him, whose advantage he had devoted himself to,
he delivered the book, 
discussing the arts with him in a friendly manner, 
in his chamber and apart from the others.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Et primo quidem ei grammaticam, quae prima est et mater artium,
exposuit; quam ipse cum tanta velocitate comprehendit ut ipse etiam
Virgilius miraretur.
-->
And in fact, he first exposed him to grammar, 
which is first and the mother of the arts.
And he comprehended it with such swiftness that even Vergil marvelled.

<!--
Dehinc ad dialecticam ventum est, in qua quantum acuti fuerit
ingenii mirum dictu est.
-->
After that he fell to logic, in which he was so sharp
that he was said to be a marvel.

<!--
Nullus enim eo exercitatorum etiam magistrorum in opponendis
quaestionibus callidior, nullus facilior in solvendis.
-->
For none, even among the experienced teachers, was cleverer
in proposing questions, and none was readier at solving them.

<!--
Inde ad florigeros rhetoricae campos transivit, ex qua venustatem
eloquii integre comparavit.
-->
Then he crossed over to flowery fields of rhetoric, out of which 
he faultlessly prepared a grace of eloquence.
</p>

<p>
<!--
His igitur tribus ad plenum adeptis, ad reliquas quattuor,
quas quadrivium vocamus, 
migravit easque non eum multo labore comprehendit dicebatque
harum ultimam, astronomiam scilicet, fore ceteris digniorem; cui etiam
in tantum animum dedit, ut per quasdam regulas sibi a Virgilio
traditas ex planetarum aliarumque stellarum motu et aeris facie
cognosceret quicquid per mundum fieret universum.
-->
And so, having attained complete mastery of these three subjects, 
he moved to the remaining four, which we call the quadrivium, 
and grasped them without much effort, and pronounced
the last of these, namely astronomy, to be more worthy than the others;
to which he surrendered his intellect so thoroughly, that,
through certain principles that Vergil had related to him,
from the movement of the planets and the other stars, 
and from the appearance of the atmosphere, 
he could find out whatever might happen throughout the whole world.

<!--
Quod didicisse multum ei profuit, ut in sequentibus monstrabitur.
-->
Which was very useful for him to learn, as will be shown further on.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Postquam igitur Lucinius omnium artium ex integro consecutus est
scientiam, libros quoque poetarum et philosophorum ab eodem Virgilio
non omisit audire.
-->
And so, even after Lucinius had achieved mastery of the knowledge of all the
arts, he still did not neglect attending to Vergil again about the books of
poets and philosophers.

<!--
Extunc itaque et deinceps ad altiorem philosophiam oculum mentis
dirigens, nomen magnorum philosophorum sortitus est et honorem, non
tamen sine multorum invidia.
-->
And so, then and thereafter directing his mind's eye to the
higher philosophy, he gained the name and honor of the great philosophers,
but not without the envy of many.

<!--
Invidebant enim ei quam plurimum qui ad summam scientiae eius
perspicacitatem pertingere non valebant dolebantque puerulo
reverentiam exhiberi, quae sibi senibus negabatur.
-->
For those who begrudged him the most were those who had not succeeded in
reaching to his height of understanding, and who were pained
to see a mere boy be shown the respect that was denied them in their old age.

<!--
Unde et, eum veneno vel alio aliquo modo extinguere cogitabant, sed
eorum malitiam terror Virgilii et regalis prosapiae auctoritas
aliquantulum refrenabat.
-->
From that point on, they thought to destroy him, by poison or by some other
method, but their fear of Vergil and the authority of the royal family 
curbed their malice a little.

<!--
Verum cum invidia suum semper possideat et torqueat possessorem nec
eum vel momento quiescere patiatur, non potuit illorum odium, quod
germinabat et stimulabat invidia, diutius cohiberi, quin, eo dolo ad
convivium invitato, vino venenum admiscerent.
-->
However, since envy always masters and torments whoever has it
and does not suffer him even a moment's rest,
their hatred, which was germinated and incited by envy,
could not be restrained for long, 
so that, after deceitfully inviting him to a banquet,
they adulterated his wine with poison.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quod tamen eum non latuit, quia iam antea hoc ipsum et eorum erga
se malevolentium per praedictas regulas cognoverat.
-->
But this did not escape his notice,
because, through the aforesaid principles,
he had already learned of this very thing 
along with their ill-will towards him.

<!--
Verumtamen haec callide ignorare se simulans aiebat invitantibus
non decere nec debere tantum tantorumque convivium absque Virgilio et
Romanorum nobilibus celebrari; si veniret ille, eorum quidem
munificentiam gratanter reciperet, paratus etiam, cum opportunum
foret, eorum vicem rependere largitati; ceterum autem sine Virgilio
suo, cum fidei suae commissus esset et magisterii eius virgam supra
modum pertimesceret, se non posse sed nec audere quicquam vel modicum
facere affirmabat.
-->
But even so,
cleverly pretending not to know these things,
he said to those proffering the invitation that
it would not to be seemly or to responsible for such a banquet 
of such men to be celebrated without Vergil and the nobility of Rome.
He would indeed accept their munificence if Vergil came,
and was even prepared, when it was suitable,
to repay this bounty in his turn.
But he yet affirmed that he neither dared nor was able
to do anything, or much at all, without Vergil,
since he had been entrusted with his good faith and
he was terrified of his master's staff above all.
</p>

<p>
<!--
His et huiusmodi auditis, illi contenebrati in malitia sua invitant
Virgilium, vocant etiam aliquos Romanorum cives, parvi pendentes si et
isti illo potu letifero deficerent, tantummodo ne Lucinius manus eorum
veneficas evaderet.
-->
After hearing such words, they, blinded by their malice, invite
Vergil, and they also summon some of the Roman citizens, 
little considering whether they might also die of that deadly drink,
but only that Lucinius should not evade their poisonous hands.

<!--
Instructo igitur convivio, discumbunt singuli secundum aetatum vel
dignitatum differentiam, Virgilio tamen utpote honorabiliori, quem
honorare omnibus a Caesare praeceptum erat, primum locum convivii
tenente.
-->
And so, with the banquet prepared, they sit down to eat, each according to
his age or his distinctive rank, but, as is natural, with Vergil
having the best seat at the banquet, as Caesar had commanded that
he be honored by all.

<!--
Ille vero qui invitaverat quique caput malitiae erat cum quibusdam
aliis ministrabat.
-->
Indeed, the one who had made the invitation and who was the head of the
ill-wishers was serving, along with certain others.

<!--
Apponuntur convivantibus supra numerum fercula, diversa pigmentorum
genera propinantur et cum magna laetitia et abundantia convivium
celebratur.
-->
Dishes, too many to count, are set near the banqueters,
different sorts of spiced wine are drunk in toasts and
the banquet is celebrated with great joy and abundance.

<!--
Interim autem Lucinius, regulas suas animo revolvens, expectebat
quando potus ille quem sibi miscuerant deferretur.
-->
But in the meantime Lucinius, turning his rules over in his mind,
was waiting for when the draught that they had mixed for him was carried in.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Dum ergo perageretur convivium refectique essent convivae omnibus
quae ad esum humana excogitari possunt arte, ecce ille pestifer,
tortuosus serpens, quem caput malitiae vocavi, aureum poculum magnae
capacitatis attulit plenum morte posuitque ante Virgilium.
-->
Therefore, once the banquet was over and the guests had been refreshed
with everything that could be contrived by art for refined consumption,
lo, that vermin, that twisted serpent, 
whom we have called the head of the ill-wishers,
brought a golden cup of great capacity, full of death, and
put it before Vergil.

<!--
Statimque nares discumbentium quadam suavitate odoris capiuntur,
irritantur ad bibendum appetitus singulorum.
-->
And straight away the guests' nostrils are seized with a certain sweet scent,
the desire of each one is inflamed by the drink.

<!--
Iam singuli potum letiferum postulabant iamque Virgilio
porrigebatur, cum Lucinius poculum rapiens manuque cunctis silentium
indicens: “Vereor," ait, “ne ista suavitas aliquod contineat amarum,
quia apis cum melle gerit aculeum et piscator hamum in esca iacit
piscibus capiendis.“
-->
Now they all were demanding the deadly draught, and even now
it was being extended to Vergil, when Lucinius, snatching the cup and 
motioning everyone to silence, said "I fear that this sweetness may contain
something bitter, for a bee with honey bears a sting and a fisherman puts
meat on his hook to catch fish."

<!--
Illi autem, quos cauteriata redarguebat conscientia, ad haec verba
rubore perfusi satis secundum poetam “vultu et colore actum criminis
fatebantur.”
-->
But at these words those men, confounded with their guilty conscience,
blushed red enough that, according to the poet:
"in expression and complexion they confessed their crime."

<!--
Attamen dissimulare et respondere aliquid temptantes, aiebant regis
filium non aequas sibi obsequium praestantibus referre gratias, qui
tale verbum licet ioculariter in medium protulisset.
-->
Nevertheless, trying anything to dissemble and answer, they said that 
the king's son, who said such things, albeit in jest, in public,
did not thank them fairly for the services that they had supplied.
</p>

<p>
<!--
At ille: “Ex hoc," inquit, “probabitur vos ad hoc verbum, quod non
iocans sed iratus protuli, immunes esse meque ac socios bono ac
simplici animo invitatos, si primi biberitis ex potu; alioquin per
patris Caesarisque salutem vitae nostrae contraria machinati estis.”
-->
But he said: "I didn't say this in jest, but in anger.
But you can prove that you are innocent
and have invited my companions and me with a good and simple heart
if you drink the first draught.
Otherwise, by the well-being of my father and of Caesar,
you have plotted against our lives."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quid agerent, quo se verterent, quid ad obiecta responderent?
-->
What could they do, where could they turn, 
what could they reply to the charges?

<!--
Undique eis angustiae, undique coartatio spiritus, undique
desperatio salutis.
-->
All around them were difficulties, a catch in their throats, and
despair for their safety.

<!--
Videbant enim sibi duo proposita, quorum unum vitare non poterant,
mori videlicet aut bibere.
-->
For they saw two choices for them, one of which they could not avoid,
namely, to drink or to die.

<!--
Sed quid ex duobus eligerent, ignorabant; sciebant enim quia etsi
biberent moriendum sibi esset, sin autem, ut malefici Caesari
traderentur diversis tormentorum generibus cruciandi.
-->
But they didn't know which one to choose; 
for they knew that drinking it would be the death of them,
but that if they didn't, they'd be handed over as criminals to Caesar
to be tortured in various ways.

<!--
Melius tamen rati propria deficere manu quam aliorum ludibrio
subiacere: “In hoc,” inquiunt, “scies, o Lucini, nos nihil tibi mali
vel consedentibus fuisse machinatos, si post sumptum hoc pigmentum
tribus supervixerimus diebus."
-->
Still they deemed it better to die by their own hands than to expose themselves 
to the mockery of others: "In this," they said, "you will know, Lucinius,
that we had plotted no evil for you or your dinnermates, 
if we survive for three days after consuming this wine."
</p>

<p>START</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Sumptoque qui detulerat poculo bibit ac deinde participibus
sceleris sui tradidit ebibendum.
-->
Taking up the cup, the one who had made the offer drank,
and then handed it to his fellow evil-doers for them to drink. 
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Qui biberunt et secundum dictum sapientis in foveam quam foderant
aliis incidentes statim in ipso convivio, oculis a capite
exsilientibus,
expirarunt.
-->
And they drank and, as the wise adage says, they fell into the
pit that they had dug for others at that very feast, and, with
their eyes bursting from their heads, they at once breathed their last.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Sicque illustris puer sua industria se et suos a morte liberans in
aemulos callide vindicavit nomenque sibi celebre apud nobiles et
ignobiles acquisivit, nec ultra ausus est quispiam contra eum sinistri
aliquod machinari, sed nec cogitare quidem, omnibus divinitatem ei
inesse putantibus, per quam haberet praescientiam futurorum.
-->
And so the illlustrious the boy, freeing himself and his
friends from death through his diligence, cleverly punished his rivals
and gained a renowned name for himself with both highborn and low,
and after that no one dared try anything untoward against him,
nor even to think of it, with everyone believing that he had
the second sight, because of his foreknowledge of the future. 
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Ipse autem cum tantus esset tantusque aestimaretur ab hominibus
paremque eum sibi in omni facultate Virgilius praedicaret, numquam
tamen ei considere voluit vel aequari, sed semper sub virga eius et
disciplina mansit ac si tunc primum elementa disceret litterarum.
-->
But although he was so great and valued so much by men
and Vergil declared him to be his equal in every skill,
nevertheless he never desired to sit down in his presence or to be his equal,
but always remained under his rod and instruction 
as in the time when he first learned the elements of his letters.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Unde ex hoc maxime eius humilitas comprobatur, quia cum ipse
procerae staturae esset, Virgilius vero pusillae, ambulans vel stans
cum magistro, incurvato contracto corpore erat, ne altior eo vel
praestantior videretur.
-->
From this especially was his humility proven, for although he was
of tall stature, and Vergil was truly short, when walking or standing
with his teacher, he held his body hunched over, so that he wouldn't
appear to be taller or better than him.
</p>

<p>END</p>
