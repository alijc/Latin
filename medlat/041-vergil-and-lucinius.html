<h4>Vergil and Lucinius</h4>
 
<!--
Florebat per idem tempus Romae ille famosissimus poeta Virgilius,
qui de Manthua, Siciliae civitate, oriundus optime notus erat regi,
quia et saepe fuerat ab eo muneribus honoratus.
-->
There flourished at the same time in Rome that most renowned poet, Virgil,
who was from Mantua, a Sicilian city and was quite well known to
the king, for he had often been honored by him with gifts.

<!--
Huic ergo ob notitiam sui et quia tunc temporis inter philosophos
praecipuus habebatur, cum muneribus magnis pater transmittit filium
obsecrans eum per deos suos quatenus puerum et scientia sua instrueret
et a malignorum insidiis diligentius custodiret.
-->
Therefore, on account of his fame and because he was 
held as distinguished among philosophers of that time,
a father sent his son to him with great gifts, entreating him by his gods
that he both instruct the boy with his knowledge
and most carefully protect him from spiteful treachery.

<!--
Timebat enim pater ne aliquid sinistri per invidiam pateretur, quia
hoc a divinis et astrorum peritis acceperat.
-->
For the father feared that the son might suffer something sinister through
hatred, for he had learned this from prophets and from those expert in
astrology. 

<!--
At Virgilius, ob reverentiam et amicitiam regis puerum recipiens,
primo quidem ei litterarum tradidit elementa ac deinde blandiendo
leniendoque, ut moris est magistrorum, syllabam ex litteris conficere
et ex syllabis formare dictionem et ex dictionibus vero perficere
orationem eum in angustia temporis perdocuit.
-->
Now
Virgil, taking the boy in because of the respect and friendship of the king, 
in fact first instructed him in the rudiments of the letters and then,
coaxing and cajoling, as is the custom of teachers,
he throroughly taught him, within a narrow space of time,
to construct a syllable from letters,
and to form a sentence from syllables, 
and from sentences to actually complete an oration.
</p>

<p>
<!-- 
Sicque paulatim proficiens puer iam per se et legere et utramque
linguam, Graecam videlicet et Latinam proferre coepit.
-->
And so, with the boy now gradually making headway through his own efforts,
he began to both read and speak both languages, namely Greek and Latin.

<!--
Laetabatur Virgilius et tantam in puero velocitatem ingenii
mirabatur spemque de eo concipiens meliorem, ampliorem ei curam
impendebat.
-->
Vergil was delighted and marvelled at such a speed of talent in the boy
and conceived a better hope about him, expended a greater care for him.

<!--
Puer vero animum dictis magistri accommodans,
qui naturaliter elegantis erat ingenii,
quicquid semel audisset, subtili statim ingenio
intellectum vivaci memoriae commendabat, 
nec opus erat ei secundo super hoc requirere praeceptorem.
-->
Indeed the boy applied his mind to the words of his teacher,
who was of a naturally discriminating character,
and whatever he heard once, he immediately 
comprehended and committed every strict detail to memory,
and there was no need for him to ask his teacher again.

<!--
Unde factum est ut infra unius anni circulum consocios suos, qui
eum et aetate praecedebant iamque quinquennio vel septennio sub
disciplina fuerant magistrorum, transcenderet rogaretque Virgilium
quatenus eum altioribus instruere dignaretur.
-->
From which it happened that within the circuit of a single year 
he surpassed his companions, who were older than he,
and preceded him by five, or even seven, years
under the education of the teachers,
and he asked Vergil to instruct him 
in deeper matters, as far as he deemed him worthy.

<!--
Ipse vero videns in eo infanti abolitam ruditatem iamque habilem
fore ad percipiendam artium disciplinam, eius libenter annuit
voluntati.
-->
Indeed Vergil, seeing a child's ignorance dispelled in him, and that he was 
already fit to be gaining sound instruction, willingly assented to
the boy's desire.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Ob dilectionem igitur ipsius earundem artium liberalium immensam
prolixitatem in tantam brevitatem quadam mirabili et ineffabili
subtilitate
contraxit ingenii, ut eas intra libelluli manualis compendium
concluderet possetque eas quivis in tribus annis facile ad perfectum
addiscere quas ipse vix cum magno etiam sudore percipere valuisset.
-->
Therefore, on account of his esteem, he condensed,
with a certain wonderful and ineffable innate logic,
an immense body of works of the liberal arts  with such conciseness
that they fit in a handbook,
and that anyone could easily learn to perfection in three years
the things that he himself had prevailed upon only with a great deal of sweat.

<!--
Hunc autem libellum nulli umquam vel hora una concedere voluit, non
magistro, non discipulo, sed nec ipsi principi orbis Augusto nisi
tantum Lucinio cuius profectui incumbebat.
-->
But he was unwilling to relinquish this book to anyone for even an hour,
not to a teacher, or a student, not even to the emperor of the world,
Augustus himself, excepting only to Lucinius whose progress he was urging on.

<!--
Huic ad cuius utilitatem ipsum ediderat, tradidit eundem, ei in
conclavi et seorsum ab aliis in eodem de artibus amicabiliter
disserens.
-->
To him, whose advantage he had devoted himself to,
he delivered the book, 
discussing the arts with him in a friendly manner, 
in his chamber and apart from the others.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Et primo quidem ei grammaticam, quae prima est et mater artium,
exposuit; quam ipse cum tanta velocitate comprehendit ut ipse etiam
Virgilius miraretur.
-->
And in fact, he first exposed him to grammar, 
which is first and the mother of the arts.
And he comprehended it with such swiftness that even Vergil marvelled.

<!--
Dehinc ad dialecticam ventum est, in qua quantum acuti fuerit
ingenii mirum dictu est.
-->
After that he fell to logic, in which he was so sharp
that he was said to be a marvel.

<!--
Nullus enim eo exercitatorum etiam magistrorum in opponendis
quaestionibus callidior, nullus facilior in solvendis.
-->
For none, even among the experienced teachers, was cleverer
in proposing questions, and none was readier at solving them.

<!--
Inde ad florigeros rhetoricae campos transivit, ex qua venustatem
eloquii integre comparavit.
-->
Then he crossed over to flowery fields of rhetoric, out of which 
he faultlessly prepared a grace of eloquence.
</p>

<p>
<!--
His igitur tribus ad plenum adeptis, ad reliquas quattuor,
quas quadrivium vocamus, 
migravit easque non eum multo labore comprehendit dicebatque
harum ultimam, astronomiam scilicet, fore ceteris digniorem; cui etiam
in tantum animum dedit, ut per quasdam regulas sibi a Virgilio
traditas ex planetarum aliarumque stellarum motu et aeris facie
cognosceret quicquid per mundum fieret universum.
-->
And so, having attained complete mastery of these three subjects, 
he moved to the remaining four, which we call the quadrivium, 
and grasped them without much effort, and pronounced
the last of these, namely astronomy, to be more worthy than the others;
to which he surrendered his intellect so thoroughly, that,
through certain principles that Vergil had related to him,
from the movement of the planets and the other stars, 
and from the appearance of the atmosphere, 
he could find out whatever might happen throughout the whole world.

<!--
Quod didicisse multum ei profuit, ut in sequentibus monstrabitur.
-->
Which was very useful for him to learn, as will be shown further on.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Postquam igitur Lucinius omnium artium ex integro consecutus est
scientiam, libros quoque poetarum et philosophorum ab eodem Virgilio
non omisit audire.
-->
And so, After Lucinius had achieved mastery of the knowledge of all the arts,
he also did not forgo attending to the books of the poets
and philosophers by Vergil himself.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Extunc itaque et deinceps ad altiorem philosophiam oculum mentis
dirigens, nomen magnorum philosophorum sortitus est et honorem, non
tamen sine multorum invidia.
-->
And so, then and thereafter directing his mind's eye to the
higher philosophy, he chose the name and honor of the great philosophers,
but not without the envy of many.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Invidebant enim ei quam plurimum qui ad summam scientiae eius
perspicacitatem pertingere non valebant dolebantque puerulo
reverentiam exhiberi, quae sibi senibus negabatur.
-->
For those who begrudged him the most were those who were not strong enough to
reach to the height of their understanding of science, and who were pained
to see a mere boy be shown the respect that was denied them in their old age.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Unde et, eum veneno vel alio aliquo modo extinguere cogitabant, sed
eorum malitiam terror Virgilii et regalis prosapiae auctoritas
aliquantulum refrenabat.
-->
From that point on, they thought to destroy him, by poison or by some other
method, but their terror of Vergil and the authority of the royal family 
curbed their malice a little.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Verum cum invidia suum semper possideat et torqueat possessorem nec
eum vel momento quiescere patiatur, non potuit illorum odium, quod
germinabat et stimulabat invidia, diutius cohiberi, quin, eo dolo ad
convivium invitato, vino venenum admiscerent.
-->
Truth always seizes the man who envies and tortures him and 
does not suffer him even a moment's rest,
he cannot free himself of that hatred, because
it is  sprouted and and urged on by envy, to be repressed every day, 
so that in fact, they deceitfully invited him to a banquet
so that they might adulterate his wine with poison.
