<h4>Vergil and Lucinius</h4>
 
<!--
Florebat per idem tempus Romae ille famosissimus poeta Virgilius,
qui de Manthua, Siciliae civitate, oriundus optime notus erat regi,
quia et saepe fuerat ab eo muneribus honoratus.
-->
There flourished at the same time in Rome that most renowned poet, Virgil,
who was from Mantua, a Sicilian city and was quite well known to
the king, for he had often been honored by him with gifts.

<!--
Huic ergo ob notitiam sui et quia tunc temporis inter philosophos
praecipuus habebatur, cum muneribus magnis pater transmittit filium
obsecrans eum per deos suos quatenus puerum et scientia sua instrueret
et a malignorum insidiis diligentius custodiret.
-->
Therefore, on account of his fame and because he was 
held as distinguished among philosophers of that time,
a father sent his son to him with great gifts, entreating him by his gods
that he both instruct the boy with his knowledge
and most carefully protect him from spiteful treachery.

<!--
Timebat enim pater ne aliquid sinistri per invidiam pateretur, quia
hoc a divinis et astrorum peritis acceperat.
-->
For the father feared that the son might suffer something sinister through
hatred, for he had learned this from prophets and from those expert in
astrology. 

<!--
At Virgilius, ob reverentiam et amicitiam regis puerum recipiens,
primo quidem ei litterarum tradidit elementa ac deinde blandiendo
leniendoque, ut moris est magistrorum, syllabam ex litteris conficere
et ex syllabis formare dictionem et ex dictionibus vero perficere
orationem eum in angustia temporis perdocuit.
-->
Now
Virgil, taking the boy in because of the respect and friendship of the king, 
in fact first instructed him in the rudiments of the letters and then,
coaxing and cajoling, as is the custom of teachers,
he throroughly taught him, within a narrow space of time,
to construct a syllable from letters,
and to form a sentence from syllables, 
and from sentences to actually complete an oration.
</p>

<p>
<!-- 
Sicque paulatim proficiens puer iam per se et legere et utramque
linguam, Graecam videlicet et Latinam proferre coepit.
-->
And so, with the boy now gradually making headway through his own efforts,
he began to both read and speak both languages, namely Greek and Latin.

<!--
Laetabatur Virgilius et tantam in puero velocitatem ingenii
mirabatur spemque de eo concipiens meliorem, ampliorem ei curam
impendebat.
-->
Vergil was delighted and marvelled at such a speed of talent in the boy
and conceived a better hope about him, expended a greater care for him.

<!--
Puer vero animum dictis magistri accommodans,
qui naturaliter elegantis erat ingenii,
quicquid semel audisset, subtili statim ingenio
intellectum vivaci memoriae commendabat, 
nec opus erat ei secundo super hoc requirere praeceptorem.
-->
Indeed the boy applied his mind to the words of his teacher,
who was of a naturally discriminating character,
and whatever he heard once, he immediately 
comprehended and committed every strict detail to memory,
and there was no need for him to ask his teacher again.

<!--
Unde factum est ut infra unius anni circulum consocios suos, qui
eum et aetate praecedebant iamque quinquennio vel septennio sub
disciplina fuerant magistrorum, transcenderet rogaretque Virgilium
quatenus eum altioribus instruere dignaretur.
-->
From which it happened that within the circuit of a single year 
he surpassed his companions, who were older than he,
and preceded him by five, or even seven, years
under the education of the teachers,
and he asked Vergil to instruct him 
in deeper matters, as far as he deemed him worthy.

<!--
Ipse vero videns in eo infanti abolitam ruditatem iamque habilem
fore ad percipiendam artium disciplinam, eius libenter annuit
voluntati.
-->
Indeed Vergil, seeing a child's ignorance dispelled in him, and that he was 
already fit to be gaining sound instruction, willingly assented to
the boy's desire.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Ob dilectionem igitur ipsius earundem artium liberalium immensam
prolixitatem in tantam brevitatem quadam mirabili et ineffabili
subtilitate
contraxit ingenii, ut eas intra libelluli manualis compendium
concluderet possetque eas quivis in tribus annis facile ad perfectum
addiscere quas ipse vix cum magno etiam sudore percipere valuisset.
-->
Therefore, on account of his esteem, he condensed,
with a certain wonderful and ineffable innate logic,
an immense body of works of the liberal arts  with such conciseness
that they fit in a handbook,
and that anyone could easily learn to perfection in three years
the things that he himself had prevailed upon only with a great deal of sweat.

<!--
Hunc autem libellum nulli umquam vel hora una concedere voluit, non
magistro, non discipulo, sed nec ipsi principi orbis Augusto nisi
tantum Lucinio cuius profectui incumbebat.
-->
But he was unwilling to relinquish this book to anyone for even an hour,
not to a teacher, or a student, not even to the emperor of the world,
Augustus himself, excepting only to Lucinius whose progress he was urging on.

<!--
Huic ad cuius utilitatem ipsum ediderat, tradidit eundem, ei in
conclavi et seorsum ab aliis in eodem de artibus amicabiliter
disserens.
-->
To him, whose advantage he had devoted himself to,
he delivered the book, 
discussing the arts with him in a friendly manner, 
in his chamber and apart from the others.

<p>AJC
<!--
Et primo quidem ei grammaticam, quae prima est et mater artium,
exposuit; quam ipse cum tanta velocitate comprehendit ut ipse etiam
Virgilius miraretur.
-->
And at first indeed he explained grammar, which is the first and mother of the
arts, to him; which he comprehended with such swiftness that even Vergil
marvelled. 
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Dehinc ad dialecticam ventum est, in qua quantum acuti fuerit
ingenii mirum dictu est.
-->
After that he was come to dialect, in which there was/will be such wonderful
of sharp nature/talent is for saying.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Nullus enim eo exercitatorum etiam magistrorum in opponendis
quaestionibus callidior, nullus facilior in solvendis.
-->
For no one by him of the trained/disciplined yet/even of the teachers in
opposing questions/investigations more clever, no one more easy in solving. 
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Inde ad florigeros rhetoricae campus transivit, ex qua venustatem
eloquii integre comparavit.
-->
Then he crossed over to flowery fields(?) of rhetoric, from which 
he faultlessly provided grace of eloquence.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
His igitur tribus ad plenum adeptis, ad reliquas quattuor,
quas quadrivium vocamus, 
migravit easque non eum multo labore comprehendit dicebatque
harum ultimam, astronomiam scilicet, fore ceteris digniorem; cui etiam
in tantum animum dedit, ut per quasdam regulas sibi a Virgilio
traditas ex planetarum aliarumque stellarum motu et aeris facie
cognosceret quicquid per mundum fieret universum.
-->
And so, having secured these three to completion/satisfaction, 
he moved to the remaining four, which we call the quadrivium, 
and comprehended them without much effort, and was speaking/naming
the last of these, namely astronomy, nearly more worthy than the others;
whose still in such a mind he gave, that through these same principles to
himself by Vergil delivered from the planets and of the other stars
moving and of the appearance of the atmosphere he learned whatever through the
heavens the universe was made.

Quod didicisse multum ei profuit, ut in sequentibus monstrabitur.
-->
What/because to learn much to him was useful, as will be shown further on.
