<h4>Vergil and Lucinius</h4>

<!--
Florebat per idem tempus Romae ille famosissimus poeta Virgilius,
qui de Manthua, Siciliae civitate, oriundus optime notus erat regi,
quia et saepe fuerat ab eo muneribus honoratus.
-->
There also blossomed during the time of Rome that most renowned poet Virgil,
who beginning from Mantua, a city of Sicily, was quite well known to the king,
for he had even been honored by him in his services.

<!--
Huic ergo ob notitiam sui et quia tunc temporis inter philosophos
praecipuus habebatur, cum muneribus magnis pater transmittit filium
obsecrans eum per deos suos quatenus puerum et scientia sua instrueret
et a malignorum insidiis diligentius custodiret.
-->
To him therefore, on account of his acquaintance and because the particular one
had then of time among philosophers, when/as to/by great services a father
sent his son, entreating him by his gods that his knowledge might prepare how
far/long the boy and he might take heed of spiteful treachery more carefully.

<!--
Timebat enim pater ne aliquid sinistri per invidiam pateretur, quia
hoc a divinis et astrorum peritis acceperat.
-->
For the father feared lest he suffer anything of the left hand through hatred,
for he had learned this from the gods and from those expert of the stars.

<!--
At Virgilius, ob reverentiam et amicitiam regis puerum recipiens,
primo quidem ei litterarum tradidit elementa ac deinde blandiendo
leniendoque, ut moris est magistrorum, syllabam ex litteris conficere
et ex syllabis formare dictionem et ex dictionibus vero perficere
orationem eum in augustia temporis perdocuit.
-->
But Virgil, on account of the respect and friendship of the king, 
taking the boy in, 
indeed at first related to him the rudiments of letters and then
about to flatter and mollify, as is the custom of teachers,
to construct a syllable from letters
and to form from syllables a speech and from speeches indeed to execute
an oration he throroughly taught him in the time of Augustus.
