<h4>Vergil and Lucinius</h4>

<!--
Florebat per idem tempus Romae ille famosissimus poeta Virgilius,
qui de Manthua, Siciliae civitate, oriundus optime notus erat regi,
quia et saepe fuerat ab eo muneribus honoratus.
-->
There flourished during the same time of Rome that most renowned poet, Virgil,
who, having been born in from Mantua, a Sicilian city, was quite well known to
the king, for he had even been honored by him with gifts.

<!--
Huic ergo ob notitiam sui et quia tunc temporis inter philosophos
praecipuus habebatur, cum muneribus magnis pater transmittit filium
obsecrans eum per deos suos quatenus puerum et scientia sua instrueret
et a malignorum insidiis diligentius custodiret.
-->
Therefore, on account of his fame and because he at that time 
spent his time among philosophers in particular,
a father sent his son to him with great gifts, entreating him by his gods
that he use his knowledge both to provide for the boy
and to most carefully protect him from spiteful treachery.
</p>

<p>AJC
Timebat enim pater ne aliquid sinistri per invidiam pateretur, quia
hoc a divinis et astrorum peritis acceperat.
-->
For the father feared lest the son suffer some sinister thing through hatred,
for he had learned this from prophets and from those expert in astrology.

<!--
At Virgilius, ob reverentiam et amicitiam regis puerum recipiens,
primo quidem ei litterarum tradidit elementa ac deinde blandiendo
leniendoque, ut moris est magistrorum, syllabam ex litteris conficere
et ex syllabis formare dictionem et ex dictionibus vero perficere
orationem eum in angustia temporis perdocuit.
-->
Now
Virgil, taking the boy in because of the respect and friendship of the king, 
in fact first instructed him in the rudiments of the letters and then,
coaxing and cajoling, as is the custom of teachers,
he throroughly taught him, within a narrow space of time,
to construct a syllable from letters,
and to form a sentence from syllables, 
and from sentences to actually complete an oration.
