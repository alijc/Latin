<h4>Vergil and Lucinius</h4>
 
<!--
Florebat per idem tempus Romae ille famosissimus poeta Virgilius,
qui de Manthua, Siciliae civitate, oriundus optime notus erat regi,
quia et saepe fuerat ab eo muneribus honoratus.
-->
There flourished at the same time in Rome that most renowned poet, Virgil,
who was from Mantua, a Sicilian city and was quite well known to
the king, for he had often been honored by him with gifts.

<!--
Huic ergo ob notitiam sui et quia tunc temporis inter philosophos
praecipuus habebatur, cum muneribus magnis pater transmittit filium
obsecrans eum per deos suos quatenus puerum et scientia sua instrueret
et a malignorum insidiis diligentius custodiret.
-->
Therefore, on account of his fame and because he was 
held as distinguished among philosophers of that time,
a father sent his son to him with great gifts, entreating him by his gods
that he both instruct the boy with his knowledge
and most carefully protect him from spiteful treachery.

<!--
Timebat enim pater ne aliquid sinistri per invidiam pateretur, quia
hoc a divinis et astrorum peritis acceperat.
-->
For the father feared that the son might suffer something sinister through
hatred, for he had learned this from prophets and from those expert in
astrology. 

<!--
At Virgilius, ob reverentiam et amicitiam regis puerum recipiens,
primo quidem ei litterarum tradidit elementa ac deinde blandiendo
leniendoque, ut moris est magistrorum, syllabam ex litteris conficere
et ex syllabis formare dictionem et ex dictionibus vero perficere
orationem eum in angustia temporis perdocuit.
-->
Now
Virgil, taking the boy in because of the respect and friendship of the king, 
in fact first instructed him in the rudiments of the letters and then,
coaxing and cajoling, as is the custom of teachers,
he throroughly taught him, within a narrow space of time,
to construct a syllable from letters,
and to form a sentence from syllables, 
and from sentences to actually complete an oration.

<!-- 
Sicque paulatim proficiens puer iam per se et legere et utramque
linguam, Graecam videlicet et Latinam proferre coepit.
-->
And so, with the boy now gradually making headway through his own efforts,
he began to both read and speak either language, Greek, of course, and Latin.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Laetabatur Virgilius et tantam in puero velocitatem ingenii
mirabatur spemque de eo concipiens meliorem, ampliorem ei curam
impendebat.
-->
Vergil was cheered and marvelled at such a swiftness of character in the boy
and extended the hope of him devising a better, greater course of study for him.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Puer vero animum dictis magistri accommodans,
qui naturaliter elegantis erat ingenii,
quicquid semel audisset, subtili statim ingenio
intellectum vivaci memoriae commendabat, 
nec opus erat ei secundo super hoc requirere praeceptorem.
-->
Indeed the boy devoted his mind to the words of his teacher,
who was of a naturally elegant character,
and whatever he heard once, he immediately 
comprehended and committed every strict detail to memory.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Unde factum est ut infra unius anni circulum consocios suos, qui
eum et aetate praecedebant iamque quinquennio vel septennio sub
disciplina fuerant magistrorum, transcenderet rogaretque Virgilium
quatenus eum altioribus instruere dignaretur.
-->
From which it happened that within the circuit of a single year 
he surpassed his companions, who preceded him by five, or even seven, years
under the education of the teachers,
and he asked Vergil how much further he thought it worthwhile to instruct him.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Ipse vero videns in eo infanti abolitam ruditatem iamque habilem
fore ad percipiendam artium disciplinam, eius libenter annuit
voluntati.
-->
Indeed Vergil, seeing a child's ignorance dispelled in him, and that he was 
already fit to be gaining sound instruction, willingly assented to
the boy's desire.
