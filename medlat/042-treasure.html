<h4>The Treasure</h4>

<p>
<!--
Fuit antiquo tempore rex quidam magnus et potens.
-->
In olden days there was a king, great and powerful.

<!--
Qui, congregandi thesauros maximam curam habens, magnae altitudinis
latitudinisque turrim auro, argento pretiosisque quibuscumque rebus
usque ad summum repleverat.
-->
And he, taking great care to collect treasures,
filled a tower of great height and breadth to the top
with gold and silver and all sorts of precious things.

<!--
Habebat autem hic militem quem in multis fidelem expertus fuerat,
cui et claves sui commisit thesauri.
-->
Now this man had a soldier whom he had found to be trustworthy in many matters,
and he entrusted the keys to his treasure to him.
</p>

<p>
<!--
At miles thesaurum servandum suscipiens, cum iam multis annis
evolutis labore et senio fractus esset nec posset iam tumultum
curamque curiae sustinere, regem obnixe rogabat quatenus suae deinceps
debilitati senectutique parcens, claves sui thesauri reciperet eumque
sineret ad propriam redire domum liceretque ei inter filios reliquum
vitae suae tempus quietum ducere et iucundum.
-->
But when the soldier accepted the position of protector of the treasure, 
since he had already rolled through many years and had been weakened
by toil and old age and would no longer be able to deal with the 
bustle of a court post, resolutely asked the king in turn
to show consideration for his debility and old age
and take back the keys to his treasure,
and allow him to retire to his own home
and spend the remaining span of his life
quietly and agreeably among his sons.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Rex vero considerans quod rationabiliter necessarioque peteret, eum
magnis donatum muneribus maestus tamen abire permisit.
-->
Indeed, the king, considering that he asked was reasonable and from necessity,
presented him with great gifts, but nevertheless sadly permitted him to
depart. 
</p>

<p>
<!--
Receptis igitur clavibus et thesauro, ipsum iterum alii commisit servandum.
-->
And so, after taking the keys and the treasure back, 
he entrusted them a second time to the protection of another.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Miles autem domum veniens curam sibi suaeque familiae sollicitus impendebat.
-->
Now when the troubled soldier went home, he devoted himself to the care of
himself and his family.

<!--
Habebat hic multos filios, quorum primogenitus militari iam balteo
cingebatur.
-->
He had many sons, the eldest of whom was already girded with a soldier's belt. 

<!--
Quem cum pater nimis tenere diligeret, omnes ei suas exposuit
divitias iussitque ut large expendens famam sibi et amicos divitiis
compararet.
-->
And since his father chose to support him very well,
he turned all his property over to him
and commanded him to lavishly spend it,
and to make his reputation and his friends with these riches.

<!--
Ipse vero, ex licentia paternis fiducialius largiusque utens rebus,
equos, arma, vestes ceteraque quibus magis adulescentum aetas extolli
delectarique solet, studuit comparare, amicos multos muneribus emens
facile post munera ab amicitia recessuros.
-->
Indeed, he took license to use his father's property recklessly and lavishly.
He strove to provide the horses, arms, clothing and the other things
with which most young men are wont to be exalted and delighted,
heedlessly buying gifts for many friends,
only to have them slip away from his friendship after getting the gifts.

<!--
In brevi ergo tempore loculos patris minuit, exhausta pecunia ad
patrem redit dicens sibi pecunias defecisse.
-->
And so within a short time he drained his father's purse
and, with his money exhausted, returned to his father,
telling him that he needed money.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Tunc demum pater recogitans secum paenitensque facti: "Quoniam,"
inquit, "te, fili, nimis et stulte dilexi, quicquid habebam tuae
subdideram potestati.
-->
Then, finally, the father, pondering with himself and regretting his acts,
said, "Because I loved you, son, too much, I put everything I had 
into your power.

<!--
At tu cernens frenum tibi laxatum, temperantiae immemor ita omnia
consumpsisti, ut nihil mihi praeter solam domum reliqueris.
-->
But you, seeing that your reins were loose, and so heedless of self-control,
have burned through it all, to leave me nothing but my house alone.

<!--
Quid ergo tibi magis faciam?
-->
And so what more could I do for you?

<!--
Doleo quidem quod fama nomenque tuum in flore iuventutis deperit,
sed unde te sustentem non habeo.
-->
Indeed I grieve that your reputation and your name are destroyed in the
flower of your youth, but I haven't got the wherewithal to support you.

<!--
Hoc tantum unum superest consilii, sed periculosum, ut si ea
largitate qua prius vivere vis, turrim in qua regis positi sunt
thesauri sub obscurae noctis
silentio adeamus."
-->
Only this remains for a plan, but it is hazardous, 
that if you wish to live with the same bounty as before,
let us pay a quiet visit in the dark of night to the tower
where the king's treasures are."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Audito hoc filius: "Nullum," ait, "pater, grave licet periculum
tecum subire refugio, tantum ne desint divitiae, ne si illae
defecerint, nominis quoque mei gloria evanescat."
-->
On hearing this the son said: "No, father, though the danger be great,
I'll run the risk to undergo it with you, but only so that the riches are not
wanting and do not fall short, so that the fame of even my name will not be
forgotten." 
</p>

<p>
<!--
Consurgunt igitur ambo nocte, turrim adeunt, perforant malleis
ferreis murum; intrat pater sublatoque quantum placuit de thesauro
exiit obstruitque foramen.
"-->
Therefore they both get up in the night; they approach the tower;
they break through the wall with iron hammers;
the father enters and, after stealing as much as he wished from the treasure,
came out and blocked up the hole.

<!--
Revertuntur domum onusti opibus alienis, et iuvenis iterum sua
utitur largitate.
-->
They return home, laden with another man's wealth, and the young man again 
enjoys his bounty.

<!--
Quandocumque iterum opus erat opibus ad thesaurum sibi notum revertebantur.
-->
Whenever there was again a need for wealth they would return to the treasure
that was known to themselves.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Contigit autem ut rex thesaurum. videre vellet, accersitoque
custode intrat turrim videtque magnam thesauri partem sublatam fore.
-->
But it happened that the king wished to view his treasure, and sending for
the guard, enters the tower and sees that a large part of the treasure has been
stolen.

<!--
Furore ergo repletus, dissimulans tamen egreditur venitque ad
decrepitum quendam senem, quaesiturus.
-->
And so, filled with rage, yet concealing it, he comes out and goes to 
a certain decrepit old man, to question him.

<!--
Fuerat hic senex aliquando, famosissimus latro quem comprehensum.
-->
This old man had been been a very famous robber, whom the king had caught.

<!--
Rex oculis privaverat eique de mensa sua cotidianos constituerat cibos.
-->
The king had deprived him of his sight and had provided his daily ration of food
from his own table.

<!--
Hic regi consilium saepe bonum et utile praebebat,  utpote qui
multa viderat et audierat suoque experimento didicerat multa.
-->
This man often gave the king good and useful advice, as one who
had seen and had heard much and with his experience had learned much.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Narrat ei rex damnum suum quaeritque quomodo perdita recuperare possit.
-->
The king tells him about his losses, and asks how he could regain what he's lost.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Cui senex tale dat consilium: "Si," inquit,  "o rex, nosse cupis
quis hoc an tuus custos an alius egerit, iube fasciculum herbae
viridis in turrim inferri supponique ignem.
-->
And the old man gives him some advice: "If," he says, "o king, you wish to know
who, either your guard or someone else, has done this,
order a bundle of freshly cut grass to be put in the tower and set on fire.

<!--
Tu autem serrato ostio turrim iterum atque iterum circumeas,
considerando si per aliquam muri rimulam fumum egredi videris.
"-->
And you, after locking the door, go round and round the tower,
looking closely to see if smoke comes out through some chink in the wall.

<!--
Hoc facto ad me redeas consilium accepturus quid post haec tibi agendum sit."
-->
When you've done this, return to me to get advice on what you should do next."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Rex autem dictum senis festinanter impleri iubens, clausit ostium
et coepit tacitus turris ambitum circumire.
"-->
Now the king quickly ordered that what the old man had said should be done,
then shut up the doorway and began to quietly circle the tower.

<!--
Ecce autem ex calore ignis viridisque materiae humore fumus
permaxime excitatus totam usque ad testudinem replevit turrim.
-->
And look! The smoke that poured forth from the heat of the fire and the dampness
of the green fuel completely filled the whole tower, all the way to its roof. 

<!--
Qui dum alias spiraculum non haberet, per locum foraminis illius,
eo quod lapide tantum sine caemento obstructum fuerat, egreditur.
-->
And the smoke, since it had no other outlet, came out through the location
of that hole, which had been blocked up with stone, but without mortar.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quod intuens rex festinus venit ad senem; quid viderit manifestat.
-->
On observing this the king hastily went to the old man and told him what he
had seen. 

<!--
Audiens hoc senex: "Scias," ait, "o rex, fures tibi tuos per locum
ubi fumus egreditur abstulisse thesauros; quos nisi aliqua arte
capias, quod superest asportabunt.
-->
On hearing this the old man said: "You know, O king, that the thieves 
carried off your treasures through the spot where the smoke comes out;
and if you don't capture them through some trick, then they will carry it all
away. 

<!--
Non enim cessabunt, quippe quibus adhuc prospere cessit res, donec
totum thesaurum exhauriant.
"-->
For they obviously won't stop doing what has so far fared them so prosperously
until they have drained your entire treasury.

<!--
Meo igitur utens consilio damnum dissimula et preme silentio, ne
rumore hoc per aures populi discurrente tuum furibus studium
innotescat."
-->
Take my advice, then, and conceal your loss and proceed in secret,
so that the hearsay flying about from ear to ear won't let on to the thieves
that you're after them.

<!--
"Et tu interim cuppam latam et profundam calenti imple bitumine,
resa, pice et glutine, quam foramini introrsus opponas, ut dum fur
more solito securus nullam deceptionem suspicans ad assuetum thesaurum
recurrerit, repente in cuppam corruat captusque et colligatus glutine
se tibi, velit nolit, in crastinum manifestet."
-->
And in the meantime, fill a wide and deep barrel with hot pitch,
resin, tar and glue, and put it inside the hole.
That way, as the thief, secure in his habits and suspecting no tricks,
hastens to his accustomed treasure, 
he'll suddenly topple into the barrel and be caught and stuck fast in the glue, 
to be revealed to you, will he or nill he, on the following day."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Admiratus rex astutum senis consilium cuppam ilico
ferventi impletam glutine opponit foramini serratoque ostio abscedit.
"-->
Admiring the old man's clever plan, the king straight away
placed a barrel, filled with very hot glue, next to the hole
and, after locking the door, withdrew.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Ecce autem fatalis illa dies, quae neminem bonum malumve praeterit,
miserum patrem eum filio eadem nocte ad turrim adduxit, remotoque a
foramine lapide intrat pater, nihil de praetensis laqueis suspicatus,
dumque festinat ut heri et nudius tertius in pavimentum salire,
incautus miser, ut erat vestitus
calceatusque, cuppam mento tenus insilit statimque vallatus glutine
redditur immobilis, ita ut nec manum nec pedem vel aliquod membrorum
movere posset, excepta lingua quae tantum ab hac iniuria libera
remanserat.
-->
But, see here, that fatal day, that passes no man, good or ill, by,
led the wretched father with his son on that very night to the tower.
And the father, after removing the stone from the hole, enters,
suspecting nothing about the trap laid for him.
And as he hurries to leap down to the floor, 
as he had the day before and the day before that,
the wretched man, caught off-guard, clothed and shod as he was,
leaps into the barrel up to his chin 
and is immediately covered in glue and rendered motionless,
so that he could move neither hand or foot or any of his appendages,
except for his tongue, which is the only thing that remained free.

<!--
Ingemiscens igitur infelix filium advocat, insinuat quibus laqueis
teneatur adstrictus, orat ut ei cito, antequam aliquis superveniat,
caput amputet et abscedat, ne forte per caput cognitus aeternam suo
generi maculam inferat et iacturam.
-->
And so, the unfortunate man calls to his son with a groan, tells him
about the trap that he's caught in, and begs him to quickly, before anyone
else arrives, cut off his head and go away, for fear that by chance he
be recognized by his head, and it bring eternal shame and loss to his family.
</p>

<p>
<!--
At vero filius totis viribus patrem conatus extrahere, eum laborem
suum frustrari videret, coepit anxiari et haesitare quid de duobus
ageret; hinc etenim horrebat suas in nece patris cruentare manus, hinc
vero metuebat per faciem patris deprehendi.
-->
But first the son tried with all his strength to drag his father out,
but when he saw that his struggle was fruitless, he
became distressed and dithered about what he should do about
the two of them; on one hand he truly dreaded staining his 
hands with the murder of his father, but on the other he had a real
fear that his father's face would be recognized.  

<!--
Dum ergo eum a nece retraheret amor, timor et necessitas urgeret,
nesciens quid utilius ad tempus ageret, caput patris cultro abscisum
fugiens asportavit.
-->
And so, while love pulled him back from murder, fear and necessity
urged him on, and, not knowing what would be best to do in this
occasion, he hacked his father's head off with a knife and carried
it away in his flight.
</p>

<p>
<!--
In crastinum autem rex summo mane de lectulo surgens intravit
turrim. cucurritque ad cuppam invenitque murum perforatum.
-->
Now on the next day the king rose from his bed at the break of
day, entered the tower, and hurried to the barrel and found that the
wall was broken in.

<!--
Et totam illam bituminis superficiem infectam sanguine, furem quoque
adesse suum, sed truncato capite deprehendit.
-->
And he found that the whole surface of the pitch was stained with blood, and
that the thief was there too.  But he discovered that he had been
stripped of his head.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quod cum audisset senex, parumper subridens: "Miror," ait, "huius
latronis astutiam.
-->
When the old man had heard that, he smiled a little: "I am
amazed," he said, "at the cleverness of this robber.

<!--
Quia enim nobilis erat nec voluit se vel genus suum prodere,
idcirco a socio sibi caput amputari fecit.
"-->
For he was noble and didn't want to betray himself or his family,
on that account he made his companion cut his head off.
</p>

<p>START</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Unde et difficile videtur mihi te posse aut thesaurum recuperare
aut cognoscere furem."
-->
From which it seems to me that it will be hard for you to either recover
the treasure or discover the thief."
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Tunc rex vehementer urgebat senem ut daret consilium, minime de
thesauro perdito aiens se curare, si tantummodo furem quis fuerit
agnovisset.
"-->
Then the king strongly urged the old man to give him advice, but not about
the lost treasure, affirming that he only wanted to know if anyone 
recognized the thief.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Cui senex: "Fac illum," inquit, "abstractum de cuppa, caudae equi
fortissimi alligari trahique per plateas et vicos civitatum regni tui.
-->
The old man told him: "Have that man pulled out of the barrel,
tied to a very strong horse's tail, and dragged through the streets
and lanes of the cities of your realm.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Porro milites armati subsequantur, capientes si quos viderint viros
vel mulieres ad aspectum cadaveris lacrimari tibique eos praesentent.
-->
Let armed soldiers follow at a distance, to seize anyone. man or woman,
who is seen to shed tears at the sight of the corpse, and present them to you.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Et si fuerit ibi socius aut uxor aut filii, nequaquam poterunt a
lacrimis temperare."
"-->
And if there was a partner or wife or son, by no means would they be able
to hold back their tears."
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Bonum rex ratus senis consilium iubet festinato truncum equo
fortissimo pedibus alligatum cum armatis militibus trahi per proximam
civitatem.
-->
The king, deeming this good advice, orders the trunk to be hastily tied by
the feet to a strong horse and to be dragged through the nearest city,
with armed soldiers.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Qui dum miser traheretur, contigit eum ante fores domus suae devenire.
-->
While the wretch was being dragged,
everyone was moved to come out their front door.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Stabat autem ille filius eius maior, qui et ei in furto fuerat
socius, ante ipsas fores.
-->
And his eldest son, who had been his partner in crime, was standing
before his door.
</p>

<p>END</p>
