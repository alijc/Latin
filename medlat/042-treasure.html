<h4>The Treasure</h4>

<p>
<!--
Fuit antiquo tempore rex quidam magnus et potens.
-->
In olden days there was a king, great and powerful.

<!--
Qui, congregandi thesauros maximam curam habens, magnae altitudinis
latitudinisque turrim auro, argento pretiosisque quibuscumque rebus
usque ad summum repleverat.
-->
And he, taking great care to collect treasures,
filled a tower of great height and breadth to the top
with gold and silver and all sorts of precious things.

<!--
Habebat autem hic militem quem in multis fidelem expertus fuerat,
cui et claves sui commisit thesauri.
-->
Now this man had a soldier whom he had found to be trustworthy in many matters,
and he entrusted the keys to his treasure to him.
</p>

<p>
<!--
At miles thesaurum servandum suscipiens, cum iam multis annis
evolutis labore et senio fractus esset nec posset iam tumultum
curamque curiae sustinere, regem obnixe rogabat quatenus suae deinceps
debilitati senectutique parcens, claves sui thesauri reciperet eumque
sineret ad propriam redire domum liceretque ei inter filios reliquum
vitae suae tempus quietum ducere et iucundum.
-->
But when the soldier accepted the position of protector of the treasure, 
since he had already rolled through many years and had been weakened
by toil and old age and would no longer be able to deal with the 
bustle of a court post, resolutely asked the king in turn
to show consideration for his debility and old age
and take back the keys to his treasure,
and allow him to retire to his own home
and spend the remaining span of his life
quietly and agreeably among his sons.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Rex vero considerans quod rationabiliter necessarioque peteret, eum
magnis donatum muneribus maestus tamen abire permisit.
-->
Indeed, the king, considering that he asked was reasonable and from necessity,
presented him with great gifts, but nevertheless sadly permitted him to
depart. 
</p>

<p>
<!--
Receptis igitur clavibus et thesauro, ipsum iterum alii commisit servandum.
-->
And so, after taking the keys and the treasure back, 
he entrusted them a second time to the protection of another.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Miles autem domum veniens curam sibi suaeque familiae sollicitus impendebat.
-->
Now when the troubled soldier went home, he devoted himself to the care of
himself and his family.
