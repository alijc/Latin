<h4>The Treasure</h4>

<p>
<!--
Fuit antiquo tempore rex quidam magnus et potens.
-->
In olden days there was a king, great and powerful.

<!--
Qui, congregandi thesauros maximam curam habens, magnae altitudinis
latitudinisque turrim auro, argento pretiosisque quibuscumque rebus
usque ad summum repleverat.
-->
And he, taking great care to collect treasures,
filled a tower of great height and breadth to the top
with gold and silver and all sorts of precious things.

<!--
Habebat autem hic militem quem in multis fidelem expertus fuerat,
cui et claves sui commisit thesauri.
-->
Now this man had a soldier whom he had found to be trustworthy in many matters,
and he entrusted the keys to his treasure to him.
</p>

<p>
<!--
At miles thesaurum servandum suscipiens, cum iam multis annis
evolutis labore et senio fractus esset nec posset iam tumultum
curamque curiae sustinere, regem obnixe rogabat quatenus suae deinceps
debilitati senectutique parcens, claves sui thesauri reciperet eumque
sineret ad propriam redire domum liceretque ei inter filios reliquum
vitae suae tempus quietum ducere et iucundum.
-->
But when the soldier accepted the position of protector of the treasure, 
since he had already rolled through many years and had been weakened
by toil and old age and would no longer be able to deal with the 
bustle of a court post, resolutely asked the king in turn
to show consideration for his debility and old age
and take back the keys to his treasure,
and allow him to retire to his own home
and spend the remaining span of his life
quietly and agreeably among his sons.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Rex vero considerans quod rationabiliter necessarioque peteret, eum
magnis donatum muneribus maestus tamen abire permisit.
-->
Indeed, the king, considering that he asked was reasonable and from necessity,
presented him with great gifts, but nevertheless sadly permitted him to
depart. 
</p>

<p>
<!--
Receptis igitur clavibus et thesauro, ipsum iterum alii commisit servandum.
-->
And so, after taking the keys and the treasure back, 
he entrusted them a second time to the protection of another.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Miles autem domum veniens curam sibi suaeque familiae sollicitus impendebat.
-->
Now when the troubled soldier went home, he devoted himself to the care of
himself and his family.

<!--
Habebat hic multos filios, quorum primogenitus militari iam balteo
cingebatur.
-->
He had many sons, the eldest of whom was already girded with a soldier's belt. 

<!--
Quem cum pater nimis tenere diligeret, omnes ei suas exposuit
divitias iussitque ut large expendens famam sibi et amicos divitiis
compararet.
-->
And since his father chose to support him very well,
he turned all his property over to him
and commanded him to lavishly spend it,
and to make his reputation and his friends with these riches.

<!--
Ipse vero, ex licentia paternis fiducialius largiusque utens rebus,
equos, arma, vestes ceteraque quibus magis adulescentum aetas extolli
delectarique solet, studuit comparare, amicos multos muneribus emens
facile post munera ab amicitia recessuros.
-->
Indeed, he took license to use his father's property recklessly and lavishly.
He strove to provide the horses, arms, clothing and the other things
with which most young men are wont to be exalted and delighted,
heedlessly buying gifts for many friends,
only to have them slip away from his friendship after getting the gifts.

<!--
In brevi ergo tempore loculos patris minuit, exhausta pecunia ad
patrem redit dicens sibi pecunias defecisse.
-->
And so within a short time he drained his father's purse
and, with his money exhausted, returned to his father,
telling him that he needed money.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Tunc demum pater recogitans secum paenitensque facti: "Quoniam,"
inquit, "te, fili, nimis et stulte dilexi, quicquid habebam tuae
subdideram potestati.
-->
Then, finally, the father, pondering with himself and regretting his acts,
said, "Because I loved you, son, too much, I put everything I had 
into your power.

<!--
At tu cernens frenum tibi laxatum, temperantiae immemor ita omnia
consumpsisti, ut nihil mihi praeter solam domum reliqueris.
-->
But you, seeing that your reins were loose, and so heedless of self-control,
have burned through it all, to leave me nothing but my house alone.

<!--
Quid ergo tibi magis faciam?
-->
And so what more could I do for you?

<!--
Doleo quidem quod fama nomenque tuum in flore iuventutis deperit,
sed unde te sustentem non habeo.
-->
Indeed I grieve that your reputation and your name are destroyed in the
flower of your youth, but I haven't got the wherewithal to support you.
