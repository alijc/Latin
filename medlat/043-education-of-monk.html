<h4>The Education of a Monk</h4>

<h5>
<!--
QUID AGENDUM A MONACHIS QUI ARTES IN LIBRO SEQUENTI POSITAS NON INTELLEGUNT
-->
WHAT SHOULD BE DONE BY MONKS WHO DON'T KNOW THE SKILLS SET DOWN IN THE FOLLOWING BOOK 
</h5>

<p>
<!--
Quapropter toto nisu, toto labore, totis desideriis exquiramus ut ad tale
tantumque munus, Domino largiente, pervenire mereamur.
-->
Therefore let us strive, with every labor, every effort, and all our desires,
that we might deserve, God willing, to come to such a great and excellent gift.

<!--
Hoc enim nobis est salutare, proficuum, gloriosum, perpetuum, quod
nulla mors,
nulla mobilitas, nulla separare possit oblivio, sed in illa suavitate
patriae cum Domino faciet aeterna exultatione gaudere.
-->
For it is useful, beneficial, glorious, and eternal for us,
because no death, no inconstancy, no forgetfulness can take it away,
but it will make us rejoice in
everlasting exultation with the Lord in the sweet homeland. 
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quod si alicui fratrum, ut meminit Vergilius, "Frigidus obstiterit circum
praecordia sanguis," ut nec humanis nec divinis litteris perfecte
possit erudiri,
aliqua tamen scientiae mediocritate suffultus eligat certe quod sequitur: "Rura
mihi et rigui placeant in vallibus amnes."
-->
But if for any of the brothers, as Vergil said,
"Cold blood bars the way to the heart,"
so that he can't be perfectly educated by either mortal or divine letters,
yet with a moderate amount of knowledge he would surely chose what follows:
"May the country and bountiful rivers in the valleys please me."

<!--
Quia nec ipsum est a monachis alienum hortos colere, agros
exercere, et pomorum
fecunditate gratulari; legitur enim in psalmo centesimo vicesimo septimo:
"Labores fructuum tuorum manducabis; beatus es, et bene tibi erit."
-->
For neither is it strange for monks to tend gardens, cultivate fields,
or rejoice in the fruitfulness of fruit trees:
for it is read in the hundred and twenty seventh psalm:
"You will eat the labors of your fruit: 
you are blessed, and it will be well for you." 
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quod si huius studii requirantur auctores, de hortis scripsit pulcherrime
Gargilius Martialis, qui et nutrimenta holerum et virtutes eorum diligenter
exposuit, ut ex illius commentarii lectione, praestante Domino, unusquisque et
saturari valeat et sanari; quem vobis inter alios codices reliqui.
-->
But if they're looking for authorities for this pursuit,
Gargilius Martialis wrote beautifully about gardens.
He carefully set forth both the nourishment of vegetables and their virtues,
so that from the perusal of that treatise, the Lord providing,
each man might be both satisfied and healed;
I have left you this treatise, along with other books.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Pari etiam modo in agris colendis, in apibus, in columbis, nec non
et piscibus
alendis inter ceteros Columella et Aemilianus auctores probabiles extiterunt.
-->
In the same way Columella and Aemilianus
stood out from the others as commendable authors on tending fields,
bees, doves, and not least on feeding fish.

<!--
Sed Columella sedecim libris per diuersas agriculturae species eloquens ac
facundus illabitur, disertis potius quam imperitis accommodus, ut operis eius
studiosi non solum communi fructu sed etiam gratissimis epulis expleantur.
-->
Now Columella, eloquent and fluent, glides through diverse kinds of agriculture
in sixteen books.
He is suitable more for the skilled than the inexperienced,
so that through his works the studious may be satisfied not only
with ordinary fruit but even with the most pleasing dishes.

<!--
Aemilianus autem facundissimus explanator duodecim libris de hortis vel
pecoribus aliisque rebus planissima lucidatione disseruit, quem vobis
inter alios
lectitandum, Domino praestante, dereliqui.
-->
Aemilianus, on the other hand, a most eloquent author, has discussed
gardens and cattle and other things with a very plain clarity in twelve books.
I have left these for you, among others, for reading over and over,
the Lord providing.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Haec tamen cum peregrinis atque aegrotantibus praeparantur, fiunt caelestia,
quamvis videantur esse terrena.
-->
Nevertheless these are the things to be prepared for pilgrims and the sick,
things that become heavenly, although they seem to be terrestrial.

<!--
Quale est enim languentes aut dulcibus pomis reficere aut columborum fetibus
enutrire, aut piscibus alere aut mellis suavitate mulcere!
-->
For how excellent it is, when you are ill, to be nourished by sweet fruits or
young doves, or to eat fish, or delight in the sweetness of honey! 
</p>

<p>
<!--
Nam cum vel aquam frigidam in nomine suo Dominus pauperi praecipiat offerri,
quanto gratius erit diversis egentibus escas suavissimas dare, pro
quibus in illo
iudicio fructum multiplicata possitis mercede recipere!
-->
For indeed, as he taught us to offer cold water to a poor
man in the name of our Lord,
how much more pleasing it will be to give very agreeable food
to diverse needy people, from whom we could accept the fruits
of a greater recompense in that day of judgment!

<!--
Non debet neglegi, undecumque potest homini probabiliter subveniri.
-->
We ought not to ignore any means by which mankind can be commendably aided.

DE POSITIONE MONASTERII VIVARIENSIS SIVE CASTELLENSIS
-->
ON THE LAYOUT OF THE VIVARIUM, OR CASTELLIAN, MONASTERY
</h5>

<p>
<!--
Invitat siquidem vos locus Vivariensis monasterii ad multa
peregrinis et egentibus praeparanda, quando habetis hortos inriguos et
piscosi amnis Pellenae fluenta vicina, qui nec magnitudine undarum
suspectus habeatur nec exiguitate temnibilis.
-->
Accordingly, the location of the Vivarium monastery encourages you to prepare
many things for pilgrims and the needy, since you have irrigated gardens and
the nearby Pellena river, flowing and teeming with fish.
It can't be held to be dangerous, either for the height of its waves or
their contemptible shallowness.

<!--
Influit vobis arte moderatus, ubicumque necessarius iudicatur, et
hortis vestris sufficiens et molinis.
-->
It flows to you skillfully controlled, wherever that is judged necessary,
and sufficient for your gardens and mills.

<!--
Adest enim cum desideratur, et cum vota compleverit remotus
abscedit; sic quodam ministerio devotus existens, nec horret
importunus nec potest deesse cum quaeritur.
-->
For it is at hand when it is wanted, and when it has fulfilled its promises
it withdraws to a distance; being thus dedicated to a certain service,
it doesn't turn rudely rough, nor can it be away when it is sought.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Maria quoque vobis ita subiacent, ut piscationibus variis pateant
et captus piscis cum libuerit vivariis possit includi.
-->
The seas likewise are near you, and they are accessible for various
types of fishing, 
and a fish that is caught can be, if you wish, shut up in a fish pond.

<!--
Fecimus enim illic, iuvante Domino, grata receptacula, ubi sub
claustro fideli vagetur piscium multitudo; ita consentaneum montium
speluncis ut nullatenus se sentiat captum, cui libertas est et escas
sumere et per solitas se cavernas abscondere.
-->
For we built there, with the Lord's help, pleasant ponds, where
a multitude of fish may wander behind a reliable dam;
so like the caves of the mountains that it might have no idea
that it is a captive, but thinks that it has freedom, and food
to get, and normal hollows to shelter in.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Balnea quoque, congruenter aegris praeparata corporibus, iussimus
aedificari, ubi fontium perspicuitas decenter illabitur, quae et potui
gratissima cognoscitur et lavacris.
-->
We also ordered baths to be constructed, suitably prepared for sick bodies, 
where the transparent water of the springs flows gracefully,
which is known to be most pleasingly both for drinking and bathing.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Ita fit ut monasterium vestrum potius quaeratur ab aliis, quam vos
extranea loca iuste desiderare possitis.
-->
And so may it happen that your monastery is sought by others
more than you yourselves can rightly desire foreign places.

<!--
Verum haec, ut scitis, oblectamenta sunt praesentium rerum, non
spes futura fidelium: istud transiturum, illud est sine fine mansurum.
-->
In truth, as you know, these pleasures are matters of the present,
not the future hope of the faithful: this is transitory,
while that is going to remain without end.

<!--
Sed illic positi, ad illa potius desideria transferamur, quae nos
faciant regnare cum Christo.
-->
But, placed there, may we be conveyed to those better desires,
which might make us reign with Christ.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Nam si vos in monasterio Vivariensi, sicut credere dignum est,
divina gratia suffragante coenobiorum consuetudo competenter erudiat,
et aliquid sublimius defaecatos animos optare contingat, habetis
montis
Castelli secreta suavia, ubi velut anachoritae, praestante Domino,
feliciter esse possitis.
-->
For if in the Vivarium monastery, as it is worthwhile to believe,
having been favored with divine grace,
you are properly instructed by the experience of the cloisters,
and if any elevated person happens to desire purified souls,
you have Mt Castellum for a sweet retreat, where as anchorites,
if it please the Lord, you can happily live.

<!--
Sunt enim remota et imitantia heremi loca, quando muris pristinis
ambientibus probantur inclusa.
-->
For there are places that are remote and resemble the wilderness,
since they prove to be enclosed in ancient encircling walls.

<!--
Quapropter vobis aptum erit elegere, exercitatis iam atque
probatissimis, illud habitaculum, si prius in corde vestro fuerit
praeparatus ascensus.
-->
And so it will be fit for you, now trained and well tested, to choose
that dwelling place, if the ascent has been previously prepared in your heart.

<!--
Legendo enim cognoscitis unum de duobus, quid aut desiderare aut
tolerare possitis.
-->
For in choosing you know one of two things,
either what you can desire or what you can endure.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Tantum est ut, conversationis probitate servata, qui non valet
alios sermonibus docere, morum videlicet instruat sanctitate.
-->
It is such that, when the uprightness of monastic life is kept,
whoever cannot teach others with words, may at least instruct them by the
sanctitiy of his behavior.
