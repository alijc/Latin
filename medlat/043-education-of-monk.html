<h4>The Education of a Monk</h4>

<h5>AJC
<!--
QUID AGENDUM A MONACHIS QUI ARTES IN LIBRO SEQUENTI POSITAS NON INTELLEGUNT
-->
WHAT SHOULD BE DONE BY MONKS WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND THE SKILLS SET DOWN IN FOLLOWING A BOOK 
</h5>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quapropter toto nisu, toto labore, totis desideriis exquiramus ut ad tale
tantumque munus, Domino largiente, pervenire mereamur.
-->
Therefore we strive, with all our labor, all our effort, all our desires,
to earn the right to arrive at such great and such excellent service
to our bountiful Lord.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Hoc enim nobis est salutare, proficuum, gloriosum, perpetuum, quod
nulla mors,
nulla mobilitas, nulla separare possit oblivio, sed in illa suavitate
patriae cum Domino faciet aeterna exultatione gaudere.
-->
For it is useful, beneficial, glorious, continual for us,
because no death, no inconstancy, no forgetfulness could take it away,
but it will make us rejoice in
everlasting exultation with the Lord in that sweet homeland. 
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quod si alicui fratrum, ut meminit Vergilius, "Frigidus obstiterit circum
praecordia sanguis," ut nec humanis nec divinis litteris perfecte
possit erudiri,
aliqua tamen scientiae mediocritate suffultus eligat certe quod sequitur: "Rura
mihi et rigui placeant in vallibus amnes."
-->
But if for any of the brothers, as Vergil said,
"Cold blood will make a stand near the vitals,"
so that he can't be perfectly educated by either mortal or divine letters,
yet with a moderate amount of knowledge he would surely chose what follows:
"May farms and bountiful rivers in the valleys please me."
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quia nec ipsum est a monachis alienum hortos colere, agros
exercere, et pomorum
fecunditate gratulari; legitur enim in psalmo centesimo vicesimo septimo:
"Labores fructuum tuorum manducabis; beatus es, et bene tibi erit."
-->
For neither is it foreign for monks to tend gardens, cultivate fields,
or rejoice in the fruitfulness of fruit trees:
for it is read in the hundred and twenty seventh psalm:
"You will eat the labors of your fruit: 
you are blessed, and it will be well for you." 
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quod si huius studii requirantur auctores, de hortis scripsit pulcherrime
Gargilius Martialis, qui et nutrimenta holerum et virtutes eorum diligenter
exposuit, ut ex illius commentarii lectione, praestante Domino, unusquisque et
saturari valeat et sanari; quem vobis inter alios codices reliqui.
-->
But if they're looking for authorities for this pursuit,
Gargilius Martialis wrote most finely about gardens.
He carefully set forth both the nourishment of vegetables and their virtues,
so that from the perusal of that treatise, which is an offering to the Lord,
each man might be both satisfied and healed;
I have left you this treatise, along with other books.
