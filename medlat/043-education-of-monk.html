<h4>The Education of a Monk</h4>

<h5>
<!--
QUID AGENDUM A MONACHIS QUI ARTES IN LIBRO SEQUENTI POSITAS NON INTELLEGUNT
-->
WHAT SHOULD BE DONE BY MONKS WHO DON'T KNOW THE SKILLS SET DOWN IN THE FOLLOWING BOOK 
</h5>

<p>
<!--
Quapropter toto nisu, toto labore, totis desideriis exquiramus ut ad tale
tantumque munus, Domino largiente, pervenire mereamur.
-->
Therefore let us strive, with every labor, every effort, and all our desires,
that we might deserve, God willing, to come to such a great and excellent gift.

<!--
Hoc enim nobis est salutare, proficuum, gloriosum, perpetuum, quod
nulla mors,
nulla mobilitas, nulla separare possit oblivio, sed in illa suavitate
patriae cum Domino faciet aeterna exultatione gaudere.
-->
For it is useful, beneficial, glorious, and eternal for us,
because no death, no inconstancy, no forgetfulness can take it away,
but it will make us rejoice in
everlasting exultation with the Lord in the sweet homeland. 
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quod si alicui fratrum, ut meminit Vergilius, "Frigidus obstiterit circum
praecordia sanguis," ut nec humanis nec divinis litteris perfecte
possit erudiri,
aliqua tamen scientiae mediocritate suffultus eligat certe quod sequitur: "Rura
mihi et rigui placeant in vallibus amnes."
-->
But if for any of the brothers, as Vergil said,
"Cold blood bars the way to the heart,"
so that he can't be perfectly educated by either mortal or divine letters,
yet with a moderate amount of knowledge he would surely chose what follows:
"May the country and bountiful rivers in the valleys please me."

<!--
Quia nec ipsum est a monachis alienum hortos colere, agros
exercere, et pomorum
fecunditate gratulari; legitur enim in psalmo centesimo vicesimo septimo:
"Labores fructuum tuorum manducabis; beatus es, et bene tibi erit."
-->
For neither is it strange for monks to tend gardens, cultivate fields,
or rejoice in the fruitfulness of fruit trees:
for it is read in the hundred and twenty seventh psalm:
"You will eat the labors of your fruit: 
you are blessed, and it will be well for you." 
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quod si huius studii requirantur auctores, de hortis scripsit pulcherrime
Gargilius Martialis, qui et nutrimenta holerum et virtutes eorum diligenter
exposuit, ut ex illius commentarii lectione, praestante Domino, unusquisque et
saturari valeat et sanari; quem vobis inter alios codices reliqui.
-->
But if they're looking for authorities for this pursuit,
Gargilius Martialis wrote beautifully about gardens.
He carefully set forth both the nourishment of vegetables and their virtues,
so that from the perusal of that treatise, the Lord providing,
each man might be both satisfied and healed;
I have left you this treatise, along with other books.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Pari etiam modo in agris colendis, in apibus, in columbis, nec non
et piscibus
alendis inter ceteros Columella et Aemilianus auctores probabiles extiterunt.
-->
In the same way Columella and Aemilianus
stood out from the others as commendable authors on tending fields,
bees, doves, and not least on feeding fish.

<!--
Sed Columella sedecim libris per diuersas agriculturae species eloquens ac
facundus illabitur, disertis potius quam imperitis accommodus, ut operis eius
studiosi non solum communi fructu sed etiam gratissimis epulis expleantur.
-->
Now Columella, eloquent and fluent, glides through diverse kinds of agriculture
in sixteen books.
He is suitable more for the skilled than the inexperienced,
so that through his works the studious may be satisfied not only
with ordinary fruit but even with the most pleasing dishes.

<!--
Aemilianus autem facundissimus explanator duodecim libris de hortis vel
pecoribus aliisque rebus planissima lucidatione disseruit, quem vobis
inter alios
lectitandum, Domino praestante, dereliqui.
-->
Aemilianus, on the other hand, a most eloquent author, has discussed
gardens and cattle and other things with a very plain clarity in twelve books.
I have left these for you, among others, for reading over and over,
the Lord providing.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Haec tamen cum peregrinis atque aegrotantibus praeparantur, fiunt caelestia,
quamvis videantur esse terrena.
-->
Nevertheless these are the things to be prepared for pilgrims and the sick,
things that become heavenly, although they seem to be terrestrial.

<!--
Quale est enim languentes aut dulcibus pomis reficere aut columborum fetibus
enutrire, aut piscibus alere aut mellis suavitate mulcere!
-->
For how excellent it is, when you are ill, to be nourished by sweet fruits or
young doves, or to eat fish, or delight in the sweetness of honey! 
</p>

<p>
<!--
Nam cum vel aquam frigidam in nomine suo Dominus pauperi praecipiat offerri,
quanto gratius erit diversis egentibus escas suavissimas dare, pro
quibus in illo
iudicio fructum multiplicata possitis mercede recipere!
-->
For indeed, as he taught us to offer cold water to a poor
man in the name of our Lord,
how much more pleasing it will be to give very agreeable food
to diverse needy people, from whom we could accept the fruits
of a greater recompense in that day of judgment!

<!--
Non debet neglegi, undecumque potest homini probabiliter subveniri.
-->
We ought not to ignore any means by which mankind can be commendably aided.
</p>

<!--
DE POSITIONE MONASTERII VIVARIENSIS SIVE CASTELLENSIS
-->
ON THE LAYOUT OF THE VIVARIUM, OR CASTELLIAN, MONASTERY
</h5>

<p>
<!--
Invitat siquidem vos locus Vivariensis monasterii ad multa
peregrinis et egentibus praeparanda, quando habetis hortos inriguos et
piscosi amnis Pellenae fluenta vicina, qui nec magnitudine undarum
suspectus habeatur nec exiguitate temnibilis.
-->
Accordingly, the location of the Vivarium monastery encourages you to prepare
many things for pilgrims and the needy, since you have irrigated gardens and
the nearby Pellena river, flowing and teeming with fish.
It can't be held to be dangerous, either for the height of its waves or
their contemptible shallowness.

<!--
Influit vobis arte moderatus, ubicumque necessarius iudicatur, et
hortis vestris sufficiens et molinis.
-->
It flows to you skillfully controlled, wherever that is judged necessary,
and sufficient for your gardens and mills.

<!--
Adest enim cum desideratur, et cum vota compleverit remotus
abscedit; sic quodam ministerio devotus existens, nec horret
importunus nec potest deesse cum quaeritur.
-->
For it is at hand when it is wanted, and when it has fulfilled its promises
it withdraws to a distance; being thus dedicated to a certain service,
it doesn't turn rudely rough, nor can it be away when it is sought.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Maria quoque vobis ita subiacent, ut piscationibus variis pateant
et captus piscis cum libuerit vivariis possit includi.
-->
The seas likewise are near you, and they are accessible for various
types of fishing, 
and a fish that is caught can be, if you wish, shut up in a fish pond.

<!--
Fecimus enim illic, iuvante Domino, grata receptacula, ubi sub
claustro fideli vagetur piscium multitudo; ita consentaneum montium
speluncis ut nullatenus se sentiat captum, cui libertas est et escas
sumere et per solitas se cavernas abscondere.
-->
For we built there, with the Lord's help, pleasant ponds, where
a multitude of fish may wander behind a reliable dam;
so like the caves of the mountains that it might have no idea
that it is a captive, but thinks that it has freedom, and food
to get, and normal hollows to shelter in.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Balnea quoque, congruenter aegris praeparata corporibus, iussimus
aedificari, ubi fontium perspicuitas decenter illabitur, quae et potui
gratissima cognoscitur et lavacris.
-->
We also ordered baths to be constructed, suitably prepared for sick bodies, 
where the transparent water of the springs flows gracefully,
which is known to be most pleasingly both for drinking and bathing.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Ita fit ut monasterium vestrum potius quaeratur ab aliis, quam vos
extranea loca iuste desiderare possitis.
-->
And so may it happen that your monastery is sought by others
more than you yourselves can rightly desire foreign places.

<!--
Verum haec, ut scitis, oblectamenta sunt praesentium rerum, non
spes futura fidelium: istud transiturum, illud est sine fine mansurum.
-->
In truth, as you know, these pleasures are matters of the present,
not the future hope of the faithful: this is transitory,
while that is going to remain without end.

<!--
Sed illic positi, ad illa potius desideria transferamur, quae nos
faciant regnare cum Christo.
-->
But, placed there, may we be conveyed to those better desires,
which might make us reign with Christ.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Nam si vos in monasterio Vivariensi, sicut credere dignum est,
divina gratia suffragante coenobiorum consuetudo competenter erudiat,
et aliquid sublimius defaecatos animos optare contingat, habetis
montis
Castelli secreta suavia, ubi velut anachoritae, praestante Domino,
feliciter esse possitis.
-->
For if in the Vivarium monastery, as it is worthwhile to believe,
having been favored with divine grace,
you are properly instructed by the experience of the cloisters,
and if any elevated person happens to desire purified souls,
you have Mt Castellum for a sweet retreat, where as anchorites,
if it please the Lord, you can happily live.

<!--
Sunt enim remota et imitantia heremi loca, quando muris pristinis
ambientibus probantur inclusa.
-->
For there are places that are remote and resemble the wilderness,
since they prove to be enclosed in ancient encircling walls.

<!--
Quapropter vobis aptum erit elegere, exercitatis iam atque
probatissimis, illud habitaculum, si prius in corde vestro fuerit
praeparatus ascensus.
-->
And so it will be fit for you, now trained and well tested, to choose
that dwelling place, if the ascent has been previously prepared in your heart.

<!--
Legendo enim cognoscitis unum de duobus, quid aut desiderare aut
tolerare possitis.
-->
For in choosing you know one of two things,
either what you can desire or what you can endure.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Tantum est ut, conversationis probitate servata, qui non valet
alios sermonibus docere, morum videlicet instruat sanctitate.
-->
It is such that, when the uprightness of monastic life is kept,
whoever cannot teach others with words, may at least instruct them by the
sanctitiy of his behavior.
</p>

<!--
DE ANTIQUARIIS ET COMMEMORATIONE ORTHOGRAPHIAE
-->
ON COPYING MANUSCRIPTS AND THE OBSERVANCE OF ORTHOGRAPHY
</h5>

<p>
<!--
Ego tamen fateor votum meum quod, inter vos quaecumque possunt
corporeo labore compleri, antiquariorum mihi studia (si tamen
veraciter scribant) non immerito forsitan plus placere; quod et mentem
suam, relegendo scripturas divinas, salubriter instruant et, Domini
praecepta scribendo longe lateque disseminant.
-->
But I confess that, whatever things can be accomplished among you 
by physical labor, nevertheless it is perhaps not without cause that
studying ancient scholars (if they write truthfully) pleases me more;
both because they beneficially instruct my mind when I re-read the divine
scriptures, and because, by writing, they disseminate the precepts of the Lord
far and wide.

<!--
Felix intentio, laudanda sedulitas, manu hominibus praedicare,
digitis linguas aperire, salutem mortalibus tacitam dare, et contra
diaboli
subreptiones illicitas calamo atramentoque pugnare.
-->
Their blessed intention, their praise-worthy assiduity, is
is to preach by means of the handwriting of men,
to recount speeches with their fingers,
to give a silent greeting to mortal men,
and to fight against the illicit deceptions of the devil with pen and ink.

<!--
Tot enim vulnera Satanas accipit, quot antiquarius Domini verba describit.
-->
For Satan receives a wound for every word that a scribe of the Lord writes. 

<!--
Uno itaque loco situs, operis sui disseminatione per diversas
provincias vadit.
-->
And so the dissemination of one's work goes out from a single site through
different provinces.

<!--
In locis sanctis legitur labor ipsius; audiunt populi unde se a
prava voluntate convertant, et Domino pura mente deserviant.
-->
His work is read in holy places; the people hear it and turn 
away from evil desire and serve the Lord with a pure mind.

<!--
Operatur absens de opere suo.
-->
He does work while away from his work.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Sed ne tanto bono mutatis litteris scriptores verba vitiosa
permisceant aut ineruditus emendator nesciat errata corrigere,
orthographos antiquos legant, id est, Veleium Longum, Curtium
Valerianum, Papirianum, Adamantium Martyrium de V et B, eiusdem de
primis mediis atque ultimis syllabis, eiusdem de B littera trifariam
in nomine posita, et Eutychen de aspiratione, sed et Focam de
differentia generis.
-->
But to keep copyists from mixing up words with altered letters
or an uninformed editor from not knowing how to correct errors,
they should read about ancient orthography, that is, Velius Longus,
Curtius Valerianus, Papirianus, Adamantius Martyrius on V and B,
the same  on the first, middle and last syllables,
the same on the letter B placed in a noun in three ways,
and Eutychen on aspiration, and also Foca on the difference in genders.

<!--
Quos ego, quantum potui, studiosa curiositate collegi.
-->
With a keen inquisitiveness, I acquired as many of these as I could.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Et ne quempiam memoratorum codicum obscuritas derelicta turbaret
(quoniam antiquarum declinationum permixtione pro maxima parte confusi
sunt), magno studio laboris incubui ut in libro sequestrato atque
composito, qui inscribitur *De Orthographia*, ad vos defloratae
regulae pervenirent et, dubietate sublata, liberior animus viam
emendationis incederet.
-->
And to keep anyone from being disturbed by the forsaken obscurity of
memorable books 
(for in mixing ancient declensions for they were the most part confused),
I applied myself to a great zeal of effort to compile for you a book,
titled "On Orthography", with select rules, so that,
with your doubt lifted away,
your spirit might more freely advance down the path of amendment.

<!--
Diomedem quoque et Theoctistum aliqua de tali arte scripsisse
comperimus; qui si inventi fuerint, vos quoque eorum deflorata
colligite.
-->
We have found that Diomedes and likewise Theoctistus had written about
such an art to some extent;
if they are found, you yourselves should likewise obtain selections of them.

<!--
Forte et alios invenire possitis, per quos notitia vestra potius instruatur.
-->
Perhaps you can even find others, through whom your knowledge can be
better instructed.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Isti tamen qui memorati sunt, si adsiduo studio relegantur, omnem
vobis caliginem ignorationis abscindunt, ut quod hactenus ignoratum
est habeatur ex maxima parte notissimum.
-->
Still, the ones that you have are memorable.
If they are reread with a constant devotion,
the fog of ignorance is ripped away from you,
so that has been hitherto unknown
is now held for the most part to be very well known.
</p>

<p>
<!--
His etiam addidimus in codicibus cooperiendis doctos artifices, ut
litterarum sacrarum pulchritudinem facies desuper decora vestiret, 
exemplum illud dominicae figurationis ex aliqua parte forsitan imitantes, 
qui eos quos ad cenam aestimat
invitandos in gloria caelestis convivii stolis nuptialibus operuit.
-->
Along with these we added the learned masters in book covers,
so that the external form will clothe the beauty of the sacred letters beyond
their dignities,
perhaps copying some part of that example of the parable of the master,
who draped wedding gowns on those whom were deemed worthy of an inviation
to a dinner in the glory of a heavenly banquet.

<!--
Quibus multiplices species facturarum in uno codice depictas, 
ni fallor, decenter expressimus, 
ut qualem maluerit studiosus tegumenti formam ipse sibi possit eligere.
-->
In these ways the varied styles of bindings should be depicted in a single book,
if I am not mistaken, with good taste,
so that the student can choose a book-cover of whatever appearance he
himself prefers. 
</p>

<p>
<!--
Paravimus etiam nocturnis vigiliis mechanicas lucernas,
conservatrices illuminantium flammarum, ipsas sibi nutrientes
incendium quae, humano ministerio cessante, prolixe custodiant
uberrimi luminis abundantissimam claritatem, ubi olei pinguedo non
deficit quamvis flammis ardentibus iugiter torreatur.
-->
We also prepared mechanical oil lamps for the night watch.
These keepers of illuminating flames, nuturing by themselves the fire,
even without human attention, amply guard
the most fertile abundant brightness of light
when an abundance of oil is not lacking,
however much they are continually scorched by burning flames.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Sed nec horarum modulos passi sumus vos ullatenus ignorare, qui ad
magnas utilitates humani generis noscuntur inventi.
-->
But neither have we suffered you to be at all ignorant of clocks,
which are known to be of great advantage to human kind.

<!--
Quapropter horologium vobis unum, quod solis claritas indicet
praeparasse cognoscor;
alterum vero aquatile, quod die noctuque horarum iugiter indicat quantitatem, 
quia frequenter nonnullis diebus solis claritas abesse cognoscitur.
-->
Therefore you know that one clock, a sundial, has prepared what the brightness
of the sun indicates; 
indeed that another, a water clock, continually shows the passage of the hours,
day and night,  
for the brightness of the sun is often known to be absent for days on end.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Haec ergo procurata sunt ut milites Christi, certissimis signis admoniti, 
ad opus divinum exercendum quasi tubis clangentibus evocentur.
-->
Therefore, these things were attended to so that the soldiers of Christ,
admonished by the most certain signs,
are summoned to practice the divine labor as if by resounding trumpets.

ABOUT THE MONKS WHO TAKE CARE OF THE INFIRM
</h5>

<p>
<!--
Sed et vos alloquor fratres egregios qui humani corporis salutem
sedula curiositate tractatis, et confugientibus ad loca sanctorum
officia beatae pietatis impenditis, tristes passionibus alienis, de
periclitantibus maesti, susceptorum dolore confixi, et in
alienis calamitatibus maerore proprio semper attoniti, ut, sicut artis
vestrae peritia docet, languentibus sincero studio serviatis, ab illo
mercedem recepturi, a quo possunt pro temporalibus aeterna retribui.
-->
But I also tell you, you distinguished brothers
who treat the health of the human body with painstaking care, 
and who devote the kindness of blessed tenderness to those who take refuge
at holy places,
who sorrow for those at risk,
grieve for those burdened with pain,
and are always distressed in your own grief in other calamities,
so that you will serve the tired with sincere devotion,
as the knowledge of your art teaches you,
to receive from it the reward which will recompense them for all time.

<!--
Et ideo discite quidem naturas herbarum commixtionesque specierum
sollicita mente tractate, sed non ponatis in herbis spem, non in
humanis consiliis sospitatem.
-->
And therefore learn at least the nature of herbs and
manage compounding with a concerned mind,
but don't put your hope in herbs, nor safety in human actions.

<!--
Nam quamvis medicina legatur a Domino constituta, ipse tamen sanos
efficit, qui vitam sine dubitatione concedit; scriptum est enim, "Omne
quod facitis in verbo aut in opere in nomine Domini Iesu facite,
gratias agentes Deo et patri per ipsum."
--> 
For although the art of medicine was ordained by the Lord,
it is nonetheless He who causes men to be healthy, who indubitably grants life;
for it was written, "Everything that you do in word or in deed,
do in the name of the Lord Jesus, 
giving thanks to God and to the father through him."
</p>

<!--
Quod si vobis non fuerit Graecarum litterarum nota facundia,in

But if you were not well versed in Greek books,
you have especially the herb-book of Dioscorides,

After these, read Hippocrates and Galen translated into Latin,
that is, the <i>Therapeutica</i> of Galen,

Cellararius monasterii elegatur de congregatione sapiens,

turbulentus, non iniuriosus, non tardus, non prodigus, sed

-->
The cellarer of the monastery should be selected from the community, a wise man,
mature in character, sober, not very gluttonous, not puffed up with pride,
not unruly, not insulting, not lazy, not wasteful, but God-fearing,
who should be like a father to the whole community.

<!--
Curam gerat de omnibus; sine iussione abbatis nihil faciat; quae
iubentur custodiat.
-->
He bears responsibility for all;
he should do nothing without the command of the abbot;
and should carry out whatever command is issued.

<!--
Fratres non contristet; si quis frater ab eo forte
aliqua inrationabiliter postulat, non spernendo eum contristet, sed
rationabiliter cum humilitate male petenti deneget.
-->
He should not discourage the brothers;
if by chance any brother makes unreasonable demands of him,
he shouldn't discourage him with scorn,
but should refuse the one who is asking wrongly with reason and humility.

<!--
Animam suam custodiat, memor semper illud apostolicum
quia “Qui bene ministraverit, gradum bonum sibi adquirit.”
-->
He should guard his own soul, always remembering what the apostle said:
"Whoever serves well, obtains a good position for himself."

<!--
Infirmorum, infantum, hospitum pauperumque cum omni
sollicitudine curam gerat, sciens sine dubio quia pro his omnibus in
