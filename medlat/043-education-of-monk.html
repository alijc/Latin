<h4>The Education of a Monk</h4>

<h5>
<!--
QUID AGENDUM A MONACHIS QUI ARTES IN LIBRO SEQUENTI POSITAS NON INTELLEGUNT
-->
WHAT SHOULD BE DONE BY MONKS WHO DON'T KNOW THE SKILLS SET DOWN IN THE FOLLOWING BOOK 
</h5>

<p>
<!--
Quapropter toto nisu, toto labore, totis desideriis exquiramus ut ad tale
tantumque munus, Domino largiente, pervenire mereamur.
-->
Therefore let us strive, with every labor, every effort, and all our desires,
that we might deserve, God willing, to come to such a great and excellent gift.

<!--
Hoc enim nobis est salutare, proficuum, gloriosum, perpetuum, quod
nulla mors,
nulla mobilitas, nulla separare possit oblivio, sed in illa suavitate
patriae cum Domino faciet aeterna exultatione gaudere.
-->
For it is useful, beneficial, glorious, and eternal for us,
because no death, no inconstancy, no forgetfulness can take it away,
but it will make us rejoice in
everlasting exultation with the Lord in the sweet homeland. 
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quod si alicui fratrum, ut meminit Vergilius, "Frigidus obstiterit circum
praecordia sanguis," ut nec humanis nec divinis litteris perfecte
possit erudiri,
aliqua tamen scientiae mediocritate suffultus eligat certe quod sequitur: "Rura
mihi et rigui placeant in vallibus amnes."
-->
But if for any of the brothers, as Vergil said,
"Cold blood bars the way to the heart,"
so that he can't be perfectly educated by either mortal or divine letters,
yet with a moderate amount of knowledge he would surely chose what follows:
"May the country and bountiful rivers in the valleys please me."

<!--
Quia nec ipsum est a monachis alienum hortos colere, agros
exercere, et pomorum
fecunditate gratulari; legitur enim in psalmo centesimo vicesimo septimo:
"Labores fructuum tuorum manducabis; beatus es, et bene tibi erit."
-->
For neither is it strange for monks to tend gardens, cultivate fields,
or rejoice in the fruitfulness of fruit trees:
for it is read in the hundred and twenty seventh psalm:
"You will eat the labors of your fruit: 
you are blessed, and it will be well for you." 
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quod si huius studii requirantur auctores, de hortis scripsit pulcherrime
Gargilius Martialis, qui et nutrimenta holerum et virtutes eorum diligenter
exposuit, ut ex illius commentarii lectione, praestante Domino, unusquisque et
saturari valeat et sanari; quem vobis inter alios codices reliqui.
-->
But if they're looking for authorities for this pursuit,
Gargilius Martialis wrote beautifully about gardens.
He carefully set forth both the nourishment of vegetables and their virtues,
so that from the perusal of that treatise, the Lord providing,
each man might be both satisfied and healed;
I have left you this treatise, along with other books.
</p>

<!--
Pari etiam modo in agris colendis, in apibus, in columbis, nec non
et piscibus
alendis inter ceteros Columella et Aemilianus auctores probabiles extiterunt.
-->
In the same way Columella and Aemilianus
stood out from the others as commendable authors on tending fields,
bees, doves, and not least on feeding fish.

<!--
Sed Columella sedecim libris per diuersas agriculturae species eloquens ac
facundus illabitur, disertis potius quam imperitis accommodus, ut operis eius
studiosi non solum communi fructu sed etiam gratissimis epulis expleantur.
-->
Now Columella, eloquent and fluent, glides through diverse kinds of agriculture
in sixteen books.
He is suitable more for the skilled than the inexperienced,
so that through his works the studious may be satisfied not only
with ordinary fruit but even with the most pleasing dishes.

<!--
Aemilianus autem facundissimus explanator duodecim libris de hortis vel
pecoribus aliisque rebus planissima lucidatione disseruit, quem vobis
inter alios
lectitandum, Domino praestante, dereliqui.
-->
Aemilianus, on the other hand, a most eloquent author, has discussed
gardens and cattle and other things with a very plain clarity in twelve books.
I have left these for you, among others, for reading over and over,
the Lord providing.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Haec tamen cum peregrinis atque aegrotantibus praeparantur, fiunt caelestia,
quamvis videantur esse terrena.
-->
Nevertheless these are the things to be prepared for pilgrims and the sick,
things that become heavenly, although they seem to be terrestrial.

<!--
Quale est enim languentes aut dulcibus pomis reficere aut columborum fetibus
enutrire, aut piscibus alere aut mellis suavitate mulcere!
-->
For how excellent it is, when you are ill, to be nourished by sweet fruits or
young doves, or to eat fish, or delight in the sweetness of honey! 
</p>

<p>
<!--
Nam cum vel aquam frigidam in nomine suo Dominus pauperi praecipiat offerri,
quanto gratius erit diversis egentibus escas suavissimas dare, pro
quibus in illo
iudicio fructum multiplicata possitis mercede recipere!
-->
For indeed, as he taught us to offer cold water to a poor
man in the name of our Lord,
how much more pleasing it will be to give very agreeable food
to diverse needy people, from whom we could accept the fruits
of a greater recompense in that day of judgment!

<!--
Non debet neglegi, undecumque potest homini probabiliter subveniri.
-->
We ought not to ignore any means by which mankind can be commendably aided.
