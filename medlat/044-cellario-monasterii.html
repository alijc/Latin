DE CELLARARIO MONASTERII QUALIS SIT.
  -->
On What Kind of Cellarer The Monastery Should Have</h4>

<p>
<!--
Cellararius monasterii elegatur de congregatione sapiens,
maturis moribus, sobrius, non multum edax, non elatus, non
turbulentus, non iniuriosus, non tardus, non prodigus, sed
timens Deum, qui omni congregationi sit sicut pater.
-->
The cellarer of the monastery should be selected from the community, a wise man,
mature in character, sober, not very gluttonous, not puffed up with pride,
not unruly, not insulting, not lazy, not wasteful, but God-fearing,
who should be like a father to the whole community.

<!--
Curam gerat de omnibus; sine iussione abbatis nihil faciat; quae
iubentur custodiat.
-->
He bears responsibility for all;
he should do nothing without the command of the abbot;
and should carry out whatever command is issued.

<!--
Fratres non contristet; si quis frater ab eo forte
aliqua inrationabiliter postulat, non spernendo eum contristet, sed
rationabiliter cum humilitate male petenti deneget.
-->
He should not discourage the brothers;
if by chance any brother makes unreasonable demands of him,
he shouldn't discourage him with scorn,
but should refuse the one who is asking wrongly with reason and humility.

<!--
Animam suam custodiat, memor semper illud apostolicum
quia “Qui bene ministraverit, gradum bonum sibi adquirit.”
-->
He should guard his own soul, always remembering what the apostle said:
"Whoever serves well, obtains a good position for himself."

<!--
Infirmorum, infantum, hospitum pauperumque cum omni
sollicitudine curam gerat, sciens sine dubio quia pro his omnibus in
die iudicii rationem redditurus est.
-->
He should take care of
the infirm, infants, guests and paupers with every solicitude,
knowing without doubt that for all of these
the reckoning will be repaid in full on the day of judgement.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Omnia vasa monasterii cunctamque substantiam ac si altaris vasa
sacrata conspiciat; nihil ducat neglegendum; neque avaritiae studeat
neque prodigus sit et stirpator substantiae monasterii, sed omnia
mensurate faciat et secundum iussionem abbatis.
-->
He should watch over all the vessels of the monastery and all its wealth
as if they were sacred; he shouldn't give a thought to neglecting anything;
he should neither strive for miserliness, nor be a wasteful squanderor of the
monastery's wealth, but should do all things in measure and following
the abbot's order.

<!--
Humilitatem ante omnia habeat, et cui non est substantia
quod tribuatur, sermo responsionis porrigatur bonus, ut
scriptum est: “Sermo bonus super datum optimum.”
-->
He should have humility before everyone,
and should return a soft answer to whomever is not granted sustenance,
for it has been written: "A good word exceeds the best gift."

<!--
Omnia quae ei iniunxerit abbas, ipsa habeat sub cura sua; a quibus
eum prohibuerit, non praesumat.
-->
He should take care of everything that the abbot charges him with;
and everything that the abbot forbids, he should not presume to do.

<!--
Fratribus constitutam annonam sine aliquo typho vel mora offerat,
ut non scandalizentur, memor divini eloquii quid mereatur “qui
scandalizaverit unum de pusillis."
-->
He should present the brothers with their appointed provisions
without any haughtiness or delay,
so that they won't be tempted to sin, mindful of the divine pronouncement of
what is earned by one "who causes one of the little ones to sin."

<!--
Si congregatio maior fuerit, solacia ei dentur, a quibus adiutus et
ipse aequo animo impleat officium sibi commissum.
-->
If the brotherhood becomes larger, they should give him assistants,
for with their
aid he'll be able to fulfill the duty entrusted to him with a level head.

<!--
Horis competentibus et dentur quae danda sunt, et petantur quae
petenda sunt, ut nemo perturbetur neque contristetur in domo Dei.
-->
In the proper seasons, both what needs to be given will be given,
and what needs to be requested will be requested,
so that no one is either disturbed or discouraged in the house of God.
