<!--XLV DE HEBDOMADARIO LECTORE-->
<h4>On the Weekly Reader</h4>

<p>
<!--
Mensae fratrum edentium lectio deesse non debet.
-->
Reading should not be lacking when the brethren are eating at table.

<!--
Ne fortuito casu quis arripuerit codicem legere ibi, sed lecturus
tota hebdomada dominica ingrediatur.
-->
Let no-one pick a book to read there by chance, 
but let the one who is to read proceed through the whole Lord's week.

<!--
Qui ingrediens post missas et communionem petat ab omnibus pro se
orari ut avertat ab ipso Deus spiritum elationis; et dicat hunc versum
in oratorio tertio cum omnibus, ipso tamen incipiente: "Domine, labia
mea aperies et os meum adnuntiabit laudem tuam"; et sic accepta
benedictione ingrediatur ad legendum.
-->
After the masses and communion, he should ask everyone to pray
that God turn the spirit of pride aside from him;
and he should speak this line three times with everyone, but starting himself:
"Lord, open my lips and my mouth will announce your praise";
and so when the benediction has been recieved, let him procede to the reading.

<!--
Et summum fiat silentium ad mensam ut nullius mussitatio vel vox nisi
solius legentis ibi audiatur.
-->
And let there be complete silence at the table,
so that nobody's whisper or voice might be heard there,
except for the voice of the the one who is reading.

<!--
Quae vero necessaria sunt comedentibus et bibentibus sic sibi vicibus
ministrent fratres ut nullus indigeat petere aliquid.
-->
Obviously, the brothers should take turns to serve each other
what is really needed for eating and drinking
so that no-one needs to ask for anything.

<!--
Si quid tamen opus fuerit, sonitu cuiuscumque signi potius petatur
quam voce; nec praesumat ibi aliquis de ipsa lectione aut aliunde
quicquam requirere, ne detur occasio; nisi forte prior pro aedificatione
voluerit aliquid breviter dicere.
-->
But if there should be any need,
it's better to ask for it by some sort of noise or gesture than by voice;
and let no-one ask anything about the reading or anything else,
or be given the opportunity;
except the prior might perhaps wish to briefly say something in explanation.

<!--
Frater autem lector hebdomadarius accipiat mixtum priusquam incipiat
legere propter communionem sanctam et ne forte grave sit ei ieiunium
sustinere; postea autem cum coquinae hebdomadariis et servitoribus reficiat.
-->
But the brother who is the reader for the week should have some bread and wine
before he begins to read, to sustain him from misfortune after his fast for holy
communion; 
but afterwards let him restore himself with the cooks and servers of the week.

<!--
Fratres autem non per ordinem legant aut cantent, sed qui aedificant
audientes.
-->
But not everu the brother in the order should read or chant,
but only those who can edify their listeners.
