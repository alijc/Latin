<!--XLVI DE OPERA MANUUM COTIDIANA-->
<h4>AJC On Daily Manual Labor</h4>

<p>AJC
<!--
Otiositas inimica est animae et ideo certis temporibus occupari
debent fratres in labore manuum, certis iterum horis in lectione divina.
-->
Idleness is harmful for the soul, and therefore
the brothers should be occupied in manual labor at set times,
and in sacred readings at set times in turn.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Ideoque hac dispositione credimus utraque tempore ordinari: id est ut
a Pascha usque kalendas Octobres a mane exeuntes a prima usque hora
paene quarta laborent quod necessarium fuerit; ab hora autem quarta
usque hora qua sextam agent lectioni vacent.
-->
Therefore, by this arrangement we trust whether to be regulated by time:
that is, for them to go outside the first thing in the morning from Easter to
the first of October and produce what's needed
from the first hour to almost the fourth.
But from the fourth hour to the hour in which they
celebrate sext they should be free from reading.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Post sextam autem surgentes a mensa pausent in lecta sua cum omni
silentio, aut forte qui voluerit legere sibi sic legat ut alium non
inquietet.
-->
But after rising from  the table after sext they should rest in their beds
in total silence, or perchance one who wishes to read may thus read to himself
so that he doesn't disturb anyone else.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Agatur nona temperius, mediante octava hora, et iterum quod faciendum
est operentur usque ad vesperam.
-->
This should be done a bit before the ninth hour, halfway into the eighth
hour, and then what needs doing should be done until vespers.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Si autem necessitas loci aut paupertas exegerit ut ad fruges
recolligendas per se occupentur, non contristentur quia tunc vere
monachi sunt si labore manuum suarum vivunt sicut et patres nostri et
apostoli.
-->
But if the needs or the difficult straits of the place require
that they themselves be employed in gathering crops in,
then they should not be discouraged, because they are then truly monks,
if they live by work of their own hands, like both our fathers and the apostles.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Omnia tamen mensurate fiant propter pusillanimes.
-->
Nevertheless all things should be in due measure,
for the sake of the fainthearted.
</p>

<p>END</p>
