<!--XLVI DE OPERA MANUUM COTIDIANA-->
<h4>AJC On Daily Manual Labor</h4>

<p>AJC
<!--
Otiositas inimica est animae et ideo certis temporibus occupari
debent fratres in labore manuum, certis iterum horis in lectione divina.
-->
Idleness is harmful for the soul and therefore during set times
the brothers should be occupied in manual labor, and also in set times
in sacred readings.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Ideoque hac dispositione credimus utraque tempore ordinari: id est ut
a Pascha usque kalendas Octobres a mane exeuntes a prima usque hora
paene quarta laborent quod necessarium fuerit; ab hora autem quarta
usque hora qua sextam agent lectioni vacent.
-->
Therefore, by this arrangement we trust by which time to be arranged:
it is so that from Easter to the first of October passing from the hand
from the first hour to the hour nearly fourth they should produce
what will be needed; but from the fourth hour to the hour in which they
celebrate sext they should be free from reading.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Post sextam autem surgentes a mensa pausent in lecta sua cum omni
silentio, aut forte qui voluerit legere sibi sic legat ut alium non
inquietet.
-->
But after rising from  the table after sext they should rest in their beds
in total silence, or perchance one who wishes to read may thus read to himself
so that he doesn't disturb another.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Agatur nona temperius, mediante octava hora, et iterum quod faciendum
est operentur usque ad vesperam.
-->
It should be done a bit before the ninth hour, halfway into the eighth
hour, and then what needs doing should be done until vespers.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Si autem necessitas loci aut paupertas exegerit ut ad fruges
recolligendas per se occupentur, non contristentur quia tunc vere
monachi sunt si labore manuum suarum vivunt sicut et patres nostri et
apostoli.
-->
But if need of place or poverty expels so that to gathering the crops
through self they might be occupied, they should not be discouraged because
then truly/in spring
are monks if by/to work of their hands they live like both our fathers
and the apostles.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Omnia tamen mensurate fiant propter pusillanimes.
-->
Nevertheless measure all things they might become on account of the fainthearted.
</p>
