<!--XLVI DE OPERA MANUUM COTIDIANA-->
<h4>On Daily Manual Labor</h4>

<p>
<!--
Otiositas inimica est animae et ideo certis temporibus occupari
debent fratres in labore manuum, certis iterum horis in lectione divina.
-->
Idleness is harmful for the soul, and therefore
the brothers should be occupied in manual labor at set times,
and in sacred readings at set times in turn.

<!--
Ideoque hac dispositione credimus utraque tempore ordinari: id est ut
a Pascha usque kalendas Octobres a mane exeuntes a prima usque hora
paene quarta laborent quod necessarium fuerit; ab hora autem quarta
usque hora qua sextam agent lectioni vacent.
-->
Therefore, by this arrangement we believe that time should be arranged in two ways:
that is, they should go outside the first thing in the morning from Easter to
the first of October and produce what's needed
from the first hour to nearly the fourth.
But from the fourth hour to the sixth should be free for reading.

<!--
Post sextam autem surgentes a mensa pausent in lecta sua cum omni
silentio, aut forte qui voluerit legere sibi sic legat ut alium non
inquietet.
-->
Then after rising from  the table after the sixth hour
they should rest in their beds
in total silence, or perchance one who wishes to read may read to himself
in a way that doesn't disturb anyone else.

<!--
Agatur nona temperius, mediante octava hora, et iterum quod faciendum
est operentur usque ad vesperam.
-->
Nones should be said a bit early, in the middle of the eighth
hour, then what needs doing should again be done until evening.

<!--
Si autem necessitas loci aut paupertas exegerit ut ad fruges
recolligendas per se occupentur, non contristentur quia tunc vere
monachi sunt si labore manuum suarum vivunt sicut et patres nostri et
apostoli.
-->
But if the needs or the difficult straits of the place require
that they themselves be employed in gathering crops in,
then they should not be discouraged, because they are then truly monks,
if they live by work of their own hands, like both our fathers and the apostles.

<!--
Omnia tamen mensurate fiant propter pusillanimes.
-->
Nevertheless all things should be in moderation,
for the sake of the fainthearted.
</p>

<p>
<!--
A kalendas autem Octobres usque caput quadragesimae, usque in hora
secundam plenam lectioni vacent; hora secunda agatur tertia et usque
nona omnes in opus suum laborent quod eis iniungitur.
-->
From the first of October to the start of Lent,
they should be given time to read until the end of the second hour;
then, after Tierce has been said,
they should take up their assigned work until the ninth hour.

<!--
Facto autem primo signo horae nonae, deiungant ab opera sua singuli
et sint parati dum secundum signum pulsaverit.
-->
But they should all cease their labor at the first stroke of the ninth hour
and make themselves ready while the bell tolls.

<!--
Post refectionem autem vacent lectionibus suis aut psalmis.
-->
But after dining they should be given time for reading or for psalms.

<!--
In quadragesimae vero diebus a mane usque ad tertiam plenam vacent
lectionibus suis, et usque decimam plenam operentur quod eis iniungitur.
-->
During Lent they should be given time to read from morning to the
end of the third hour, and up to the end of the tenth hour they should do the
work that is assigned to them.

<!--
In quibus diebus quadragesimae accipiant omnes singulos codices de
bibliotheca quos per ordinem ex integro legant, qui codices in caput
quadragesimae dandi sunt.
-->
During Lent they should each take a single book from the library
which they should read from start to finish,
and these books are to be given out at the start of Lent.

<p>START</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Ante omnia sane deputentur unus aut duo seniores qui circumeant
monasterium horis quibus vacant fratres lectioni, et videant ne forte
inveniatur frater acediosus qui vacat otio aut fabulis et non est
intentus lectioni, et non solum sibi inutilis est, sed etiam alios extollit.
-->
Before everything within reason is assigned, one or two elders who circulate
the monastery in the hours which the brothers are idle, lecturing
and they might see lest by chance
a listless brother is discovered who is idle with leisure or tales
and is not attentive to the reading, and not only is useless,
but even extolls the others.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Hic talis si -- quod absit -- repertus fuerit, corripiatur semel et
secundo; si non emendaverit, correptioni regulari subiaceat taliter ut
ceteri timeant.
-->
He/here so much if -- God forbid(?) -- he was discovered, let him be chastized
one and two times; if he doesn't improve, to canonical reproof let him come
under in such a way that the others fear.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Neque frater ad fratrem iungatur horis incompetentibus.
-->
And let not brother to brother be joined in insufficient hours.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Dominico item die lectioni vacent omnes, excepto his qui variis
officiis deputati sunt.
-->
On the Lord's day as well, they all should be free for the readings,
except for those who have been assigned to varius duties.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Si quis vero ita neglegens et desidiosus fuerit ut non velit aut non
possit meditare aut legere, iniungatur ei opus quod faciat ut non vacet.
-->
If anyone is really so heedless and idle that he doesn't want to or can't
meditate or read, let them be joined/charged to him work that he might do
so that he is not idle.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Fratribus infirmis aut delicatis talis opera aut ars iniungatur ut
nec otiosi sint nec violentia laboris opprimantur aut effugentur; quorum
imbecillitas ab abbate consideranda est.
-->
to/by unwell or delicate brothers such work or crafts let be charged
so that neither they be idle or with violent labor be oppressed or detered;
of whom feebleness by the abbot is to be examined.
