Attila vero nancta occasione de recessu
Vesegothorum et, quod saepe optaverat, cernens hostium solutionem
per partes, mox iam securus ad oppressionem Romanorum movit
procinctum primaque adgressione Aquileiensem obsedit civitatem,
quae est metropolis Venetiarum, in mucrone vel lingua Adriatici
posita sinus, cuius ab oriente muros Natissa amnis fluens a monte
Piccis elambit.
-->
In fact, Attila, had got an opportunity from the Visigoths' retreat
and perceived a long hoped-for division among the enemy throughout the region.
He was soon free from danger and shifted his army to overthrow the Romans.
And with the first assault he besieged the city of Aquileia,
the chief city of Venice, positioned on a sharp point or tongue
of an Adriatic bay, whose walls are lapped by the Natissa River,
flowing from the east from Mount Piccis.
