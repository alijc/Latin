<h4>XLVII Attila in Italy</h4>

<p>
<!--
Attila vero nancta occasione de recessu
Vesegothorum et, quod saepe optaverat, cernens hostium solutionem
per partes, mox iam securus ad oppressionem Romanorum movit
procinctum primaque adgressione Aquileiensem obsedit civitatem,
quae est metropolis Venetiarum, in mucrone vel lingua Adriatici
posita sinus, cuius ab oriente muros Natissa amnis fluens a monte
Piccis elambit.
-->
In fact, Attila, had got an opportunity from the Visigoths' retreat
and perceived a long hoped-for division among the enemy throughout the region.
He was soon free from danger and shifted his army to overthrow the Romans.
And with the first assault he besieged the city of Aquileia,
the chief city of Venice, positioned on a sharp point or tongue
of an Adriatic bay, whose walls are lapped by the Natissa River,
flowing from the east from Mount Piccis.

<p>
<!--
Ibique cum diu multumque obsidens nihil penitus praevaleret,
fortissimis intrinsecus Romanorum militibus resistentibus,
exercitu iam murmurante et discedere cupiente, Attila deambulans
circa muros, dum, utrum solveret castra an adhuc remoraretur,
deliberat, animadvertit candidas aves, id est ciconias, qui in
fastigia domorum nidificant, de civitate fetus suos trahere
atque contra morem per rura forinsecus comportare.
-->
But after the siege had been under way for many days with no breaking through
their defenses, being resisted from the inside by very powerful Romans,
and with his army now murmuring and desiring to withdraw,
Attila was strolling around the walls and pondering whether to break
camp or put it off.
He notices white birds, that is, storks, that nest on roof-tops,
hauling their young out the city and,
country to custom, carrying them out into the country.

<p>
<!--
Et, ut erat sagacissimus inquisitor, praesensit et ad suos:
"Respicite," inquit, "aves futurarum rerum providas perituram
relinquere civitatem casurasque arces periculo imminente
deserere.
-->
And, as he was a damn good observer, he had a presentiment and said to his men: 
"Look," he said, "the birds, who already know the future,
are escaping the coming destruction and deserting the city and the citadels that
are about to topple in the imminent danger.

<!--
Non hoc vacuum, non hoc credatur incertum; rebus praesciis
consuetudinem mutat ventura formido."
-->
Don't think this hollow or uncertain; 
the coming terror has altered the habits of prescient critters."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quid plura?
-->
What happened next?
</p>

<p>
<!--
Animos suorum rursus ad oppugnandam Aquileiam inflammat.
-->
He rekindled their courage for the assault on Aquileia.

<!--
Qui machinis constructis omniaque genera tormentorum adhibita,
nec mora, et invadunt civitatem, spoliant, dividunt
vastantque crudeliter ita ut vix eius vestigia ut appareant
reliquerunt.
-->
And they constructed seige engines and employed all sorts of catapults
without delay, and entered the city, plundered it, divvied it up and
laid waste to it so that hardly a trace of it remained to be seen.
