<h4>XLVII Attila in Italy</h4>

<p>
<!--
Attila vero nancta occasione de recessu
Vesegothorum et, quod saepe optaverat, cernens hostium solutionem
per partes, mox iam securus ad oppressionem Romanorum movit
procinctum primaque adgressione Aquileiensem obsedit civitatem,
quae est metropolis Venetiarum, in mucrone vel lingua Adriatici
posita sinus, cuius ab oriente muros Natissa amnis fluens a monte
Piccis elambit.
-->
In fact, Attila, had got an opportunity from the Visigoths' retreat
and perceived a long hoped-for division among the enemy throughout the region.
He was soon free from danger and shifted his army to overthrow the Romans.
And with the first assault he besieged the city of Aquileia,
the chief city of Venice, positioned on a sharp point or tongue
of an Adriatic bay, whose walls are lapped by the Natissa River,
flowing from the east from Mount Piccis.

Ibique cum diu multumque obsidens nihil penitus praevaleret,
fortissimis intrinsecus Romanorum militibus resistentibus,
exercitu iam murmurante et discedere cupiente, Attila deambulans
circa muros, dum, utrum solveret castra an adhuc remoraretur,
deliberat, animadvertit candidas aves, id est ciconias, qui in
fastigia domorum nidificant, de civitate fetus suos trahere
atque contra morem per rura forinsecus comportare.
-->
But after the siege had been under way for many days with no breaking through
their defenses, being resisted from the inside by very powerful Romans,
and with his army now murmuring and desiring to withdraw,
Attila is strolling around the walls, while he ponders whether to break
camp or yet delay.
He notices white birds, that is, storks, that nest on the gables of the
houses, to have their young around the city,
as opposed the custom through the country to bear them outside.
