<h4>QUEEN RADEGUNDA AS A NUN</h4>

<p>
<!--
Adhuc monachabus omnibus soporantibus calceamenta tergens
et unguens, retransmittebat per singulas.
-->
There, while the nuns slept, she used to clean and oil their shoes,
and return them to each of them.

<!--
Nam et reliquo tempore praeter dies paschales ac summae
festivitatis, donec infirmitas permisit, in cinerem ac
cilicium semper vitam duxit austeram, prius se levans ut
psalleret quam congregatio surrexisset.
-->
For even during the rest of the time,
except for the days of Easter or of a high holy day,
while her health permitted she always passed an austere life
in ashes and a hairshirt,
getting herself out of bed to sing psalms before the comminity rose.

<!--
Nam de officiis monasterialibus nihil sibi placuit nisi prima
serviret, et ipsa se castigabat si bonum post alteram ageret.
-->
For nothing pleased her about her monastic duties
unless she would do the service first,
and she would chastise herself if another did good before she did.

<!--
Ergo suis vicibus scopans monasterii plateas simul et angulos,
quicquid erat foedum purgans, et sarcinas quas alii horrent
videre non abhorrebat evehere.
-->
Therefore, when sweeping the monastery's paths in her turn, she also did the
corners, cleaning out whatever was filthy,
and she wasn't loath to carry away burdens that the others dreaded to see.

<!--
Ligna supportans bracchiis, focum flatibus et forcipibus
admonens, cadens nec laesa se retrahens, extra suam hebdomadam
infirmantibus serviens, ipsa cibos decoquens, aegrotis facies
abluens, ipsa calidum porrigens, visitabat quos fovebat, ieiuna
rediens cellulam.
-->
Carrying firewood in her arms, tending the hearth with breath and tongs,
falling and telling no-one about her injuries,
spending more than her allotted week in serving those who were ill,
boiling their food herself, washing the faces of the sick,
offering them hot drinks,
she would visit those that she nursed,
and then return to her cell fasting.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Illud quoque quis explicet quanto fervore excitata ad
coquinam concursitabat, suam faciens septimanam?
-->
Moreover, who could explain how she would race around the kitchen,
stirred up with the heat, doing her week's cooking duty?

<!--
Denique nulla monacharum nisi ipsa de posticio, quantum
ligni opus erat, sola ferebat in sarcina.
-->
Finally, none of the nuns but she would carry a bundle of wood, however much was
needed, in from the back door.

<!--
Aquam de puteo trahebat et dispensabat per vascula.
-->
She would draw up water from the well and pour it out into vessels.

<!--
Holus purgans, legumen lavans, flatu focum vivificans; et
ut decoqueret escas satagebat exaestuans, vasa de foco ipsa
levans, discos lavans et inferens.
-->
She would bustle about cleaning vegetables, washing pulse,
reviving the hearth with her breath;
and bringing the food to a boil, lifting dishes from the hearth herself,
washing platters and putting them away.

<!--
Hinc consummatis conviviis ipsa vascula diluens, purgans
nitide coquinam, quicquid erat lutulentum ferebat foras in
locum designatum.
-->
After this, when the meals were ended, she herself would empty the vessels and
clean the kitchen til it sparkled; and
she would carry the trash outdoors to its proper place.

<!--
Humilitate sanctissima pedes lavans et osculans, et adhuc
omnes prostrata deprecabatur veniam neglegentia pro commissa.
-->
She would wash and kiss the people's feet with divine humility, and,
still prostrate, would entreat everyone for pardon in her neglegence in
the undertaking.
