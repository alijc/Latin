<h4>QUEEN RADEGUNDA AS A NUN</h4>
 
<p>START</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Adhuc monachabus omnibus soporantibus calceamenta tergens
et unguens, retransmittebat per singulas.
-->
til now with all nuns falling asleep, shoes wiping
and oiling, she would go back across apiece.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Nam et reliquo tempore praeter dies paschales ac summae
festivitatis, donec infirmitas permisit, in cinerem ac
cilicium semper vitam duxit austeram, prius se levans ut
psalleret quam congregatio surrexisset.
-->
For even to/by the rest except for the days of Easter and of a high
holy day, while/until sickness permitted into ashes and
hairshirt she always passed an austere life, before self lifting to
sing the psalms before the comminity got up.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Nam de officiis monasterialibus nihil sibi placuit nisi prima
serviret, et ipsa se castigabat si bonum post alteram ageret.
-->
For about the monastic duties/services nothing pleased her except/unless she
first would serve, and herself would chastise herself if she did good after
another. 
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Ergo suis vicibus scopans monasterii plateas simul et angulos,
quicquid erat foedum purgans, et sarcinas quas alii horrent
videre non abhorrebat evehere.
-->
Therefore in her turn sweeping the paths of the monastery at the same time
and corners,
whatever was filthy making clean, and >packs which others dreaded
to see she didn't abhor to carry away.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Ligna supportans bracchiis, focum flatibus et forcipibus
admonens, cadens nec laesa se retrahens, extra suam hebdomadam
infirmantibus serviens, ipsa cibos decoquens, aegrotis facies
abluens, ipsa calidum porrigens, visitabat quos fovebat, ieiuna
rediens cellulam.
-->
carrying firewood in her arms, >hearth with blowing and tongs
warning/persuading, falling and not having struck herself drawing back, beyond
her week serving the ill, herself consuming/wasting food, to/by the sick
washing faces, herself extending mulled wine, she would visit those that she
fostered, fasting returning to her cell.
</p>
