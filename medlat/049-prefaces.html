Decedente atque immo potius pereunte ab urbibus
Gallicanis liberalium cultura litterarum, cum nonnullae res
gererentur vel rectae vel improbae, ac feritas gentium
desaeviret, regum furor acueretur, ecclesiae impugnarentur ab
haereticis, a catholicis tegerentur, ferveret Christi fides in
plurimis, tepesceret in nonnullis, ipsae quoque ecclesiae vel
ditarentur a devotis vel nudarentur a perfidis, nec reperiri
possit quisquam peritus dialectica in arte aut grammaticus, qui
haec aut stilo prosaico aut metrico depingeret versu:
ingemiscebant saepius plerique, dicentes: "Vae diebus nostris,
quia periit studium litterarum a nobis, nec reperiretur in
populis qui gesta praesentia promulgare possit in paginis."

After the culture of liberal literature faded, nay, perished, from the cities
of France, when many things, either honest or wicked, were done
and the brutality of the heathens raged, the fury of kings sharpened,
churches were attacked by heretics and defended by Catholics,
the faith of Christ grew hot in many, but cooled in some,
the very churches also were either enriched by the devout or
stripped bare by the faithless,
and no scholar or expert in the art of logic could be found,
who could describe these things with his pen
in either prose or in metrical verse: most lamenting often, saying:
"Woe be to our days, for the study of literature has perished from us,
and no-one could be found among the people who
could publish deeds in writings in the present day."

Ista etenim atque et his similia iugiter intuens dici,
pro commemoratione praeteritorum, ut notitiam adtingerent
venientium, etsi inculto effatu, nequivi tamen obtegere vel
certamina flagitiosorum vel vitam recte viventium; et
praesertim his illicitus stimulis, quod a nostris fari
plerumque miratus sum quia philosophantem rhetorem intellegunt
pauci, loquentem rusticum multi.
-->
Indeed, even these things and the things like them 
that one is continually seeing said, according to our memory of the past,
so that future generations may arrive at the knowledge,
albeit through uncultivated language,
to be unable to still conceal either the struggles of the shameful or the lives
of those who lived properly.
I am especially enticed by these stimulants,
because I was amazed at most of what we say,
for they understand a philosophizing rhetorician but little,
but a loquacious peasant a great deal.
