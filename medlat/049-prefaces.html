Decedente atque immo potius pereunte ab urbibus
Gallicanis liberalium cultura litterarum, cum nonnullae res
gererentur vel rectae vel improbae, ac feritas gentium
desaeviret, regum furor acueretur, ecclesiae impugnarentur ab
haereticis, a catholicis tegerentur, ferveret Christi fides in
plurimis, tepesceret in nonnullis, ipsae quoque ecclesiae vel
ditarentur a devotis vel nudarentur a perfidis, nec reperiri
possit quisquam peritus dialectica in arte aut grammaticus, qui
haec aut stilo prosaico aut metrico depingeret versu:
ingemiscebant saepius plerique, dicentes: "Vae diebus nostris,
quia periit studium litterarum a nobis, nec reperiretur in
populis qui gesta praesentia promulgare possit in paginis."

After the tending of books departed, nay, passed away from, the cities of
well-bred France, when a few matters 
were managed/borne either proper/honest or wicked, and the brutality of the
people raged, the fury/madness of kings sharpened, churches were attacked by
heretics and defended by Catholics, faith of Christ burned in
most/many, became tepid in a few, of itself also the churches or
were enriched by the devout or stripped by the faithless, and not to be found
it could than/that the man skilled in logic in art or a scholar/grammarian, who
portrayed these either by stylus in prose or in metrical verse:
most were moaning often, saying: "Woe to/by our days,
for the study of books passed away from us, and not was discovered in
peoples who deeds in the present time to publish on pages."

.. Ista etenim atque et his similia iugiter intuens dici,
pro commemoratione praeteritorum, ut notitiam adtingerent
venientium, etsi inculto effatu, nequivi tamen obtegere vel
certamina flagitiosorum vel vitam recte viventium; et
praesertim his illicitus stimulis, quod a nostris fari
plerumque miratus sum quia philosophantem rhetorem intellegunt
pauci, loquentem rusticum multi.

those and indeed to/by these parallels continually considering to be said/named,
according to the rememberance of the past, to arrive at acquaintance  
of those coming, although by uncultivated speech(?), to be unable still to
protect/conceal either contests of disgraceful or >life of the properly lived;
and especially forbidden to/by these spurs, because by us to speak
generally/the most I was amazed, for they understand a philosophizing
rhetorician a little, >speaking peasant a lot.
