<h4>THE STORY OF ATTALUS</h4>

<p>
<!--
Theudericus vero et Childebertus foedus inierunt et, dato
sibi sacramento, ut nullus contra alium moveretur, obsides ab
invicem acceperunt, quo facilius firmarentur quae fuerant dicta.
-->
Now Theudericus and Childebertus entered into a treaty and,
after pledging each other an oath that neither would move against the other,
accepted hostages from each another, by which means what had been declared
would be more easily confirmed.

<!--
Multi tunc filii senatorum in hac obsidione dati sunt; sed orto
iterum inter reges scandalum, ad servitium publicum sunt
addicti, et quicumque eos ad custodiendum accepit.
-->
Then many senators' sons were given into this captivity:
but after a quarrel rose up again between the kings
they were sentenced to common servitude, and anyone could take them
into custody.

<!--
Multi tamen ex eis per fugam lapsi, in patriam redierunt,
nonnulli in servitio sunt retenti.
-->
While many of them slipped away in flight and returned to their native land.
some were held fast in servitude.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Inter quos Attalus, nepos beati Gregorii, Lingonici
episcopi, ad publicum servitium mancipatus est custosque
equorum destinatus.
-->
Among these was Attalus, the nephew of the blessed Gregory, bishop of Langres.
He was given over into common servitude and sent to the horse stables.


<!--
Erat enim intra Treverici termini territorio cuidam barbaro serviens.
-->
For he was working for a foreigner in the territory of Treves.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Denique beatus Gregorius ad inquirendum cum pueros
destinavit, qui, inventum, obtulerunt homini munera.
-->
Then the blessed Gregory arranged for servants to search him out.
And when they found Attalus, they offered gifts to his master.

<!--
Sed respuit ea, dicens: "Hic tali generatione decem auri libras
redimi debet."
-->
But he rejected them, saying: "One of such birth needs ten pounds of
gold to be redeemed."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quibus redeuntibus, Leo quidam ex coquina domini sui ait:
"Utinam me permitteres et forsitan ego poteram eum reducere
de captivitate."
-->
Upon their return, a certain Leo from their lord's kitchen said:
"If you would let me go, perhaps I could fetch him back from captivity."

<!--
Gaviso autem domino, directus venit ad locum voluitque puerum
clam abstrahere sed non potuit.
-->
Now the lord was happy to do it, so straightway he went to the spot and wanted
to steal the boy away, but could not.

<!--
Tunc locatum secum hominem quendam ait: "Veni mecum et
venunda me in domo barbari illius, sitque tibi lucrum
pretium meum, tantum liberiorem aditum habeam faciendi id
quod decrevi."
-->
Then, bargaining with a certain man, he said: "Come with me and
sell me in the house of that foreigner, and let my price be a profit to you,
while I'll have freer access to do what I have resolved."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Accepta vero sacramenta, homo ille abiit et, venditum
duodecim aureis, discessit.
-->
And indeed, after exchanging guarantees, that man left and,
after Leo was sold for twelve pieces of gold, he went away.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Sciscitatus autem emptor rudi famulo quid operis sciret
respondit: "In omnibus quae manducari debent in mensis
dominorum valde scitus sum operari, nec metuo quod reperiri
possit similis mei in hac scientia.
-->
Now when his purchaser asked his new slave what work he knew,
he replied: "I am inordinately skilled in all things that are
eaten at a lord's table, and doubt that anyone
could be found who is my like in this knowledge.

<!--
Verum enim dico tibi quia, etiam si regi epulum cupias
praeparare, fercula regalia componere possum, nec quisquam a
me melius."
-->
For I speak the truth to you that, even if you desired to prepare
a banquet for the king, I can create royal dishes,
and no-one is better than me."
</p>

<p>
<!--
At ille: "Ecce enim dies solis adest" (sic enim barbaries
vocitare diem dominicum consueta est); "in hac die vicini atque
parentes mei invitabuntur in domo mea.
-->
But he said: "Look now, the day of the sun is nigh"
(For thus is a foreigner wont to call the day of the Lord);
on which day my neighbors and relatives are invited to my house.

<!--
Rogo ut facias mihi prandium quod admirentur et dicant quia
in domo regis melius non aspeximus."
-->
I ask you to make me a midday meal that they'll wonder at,
and say that they haven't see better in a king's house."
</p><!--"-->

<p>
<!--
Et ille: "Iubeat," inquit, "dominus meus congregari pullorum
gallinaceorum multitudinem et faciam quae praecipis."
-->
And he said: "Let my lord command a mass of young hens to be collected
and I'll do as you command."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Praeparatis ergo quae dixerat puer, illuxit dominica dies
fecitque epulum magnum deliciisque refertum.
-->
And so, after what the boy had said had been readied, the Lord's day dawned
and he made a feast, great and filled with delights.

<!--
Epulantibus autem omnibus et laudantibus prandium, parentes
illius discesserunt.
-->
And after all had feasted and praised the meal, his relatives departed.

<!--
Dominus enim dedit gratiam puero huic et accepit potestatem
super omnia quae habebat dominus suus in promptu, diligebatque eum
valde et omnibus qui cum eo erant ipse dispensabat cibaria et
pulmenta.
-->
Now the lord gave thanks to this boy and, and he accepted authority
over all that his lord had in readiness, and he, and everyone who was with him,
valued him greatly, and he himself dispensed rations and food.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Post anni vero curriculum, cum iam securus esset dominus
illius de eo, abiit in pratum, qui erat domi proximus, cum Attalo
puero, custode equorum; et decubans in terram cum eo a longe,
aversis dorsis, ut non cognoscerentur simul, dicit puero: "Tempus
est enim ut iam cogitare de patria debeamus.
-->
Now after the passage of a year, after his master was feeling at ease
about him, he went out into a meadow that was near the house, along
with the boy Attalus, the groom; and lying on the ground with him 
at a distance, and turning their backs,
so that they wouldn't be recognized together, he said to the boy:
"Indeed, it is now time for us to think about our own country.

<!--
Ideoque moneo te ut hac nocte, cum equos ad claudendum
adduxeris, sopore non deprimaris, sed cum primum te vocitavero
adsis et ambulemus."
-->
And therefore I advise you that tonight, after you've led the horses away
and shut them up, don't fall asleep,
but be ready the moment that I call you, and let us be away."
<!--"-->

<!--
Vocaverat enim barbarus ille multos parentum suorum ad epulum
inter quos erat et gener eius, qui acceperat filiam illius.
-->
For that foreigner had summoned many of his relatives to a feast
and among them was his son-in-law, who had married his daughter.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Media autem nocte a convivio surgentibus et quieti datis,
prosecutus est Leo generum domini sui cum potu, porrigensque ei
bibere, in metatum eius ait ad eum homo: "Dic tu, o
creditor soceri mei, sic valeas, quando enim voluntatem
adhibebis, ut adsumptis equitibus eius, eas in patriam
tuam?"
-->
Now in the middle of the night, after they rose from the banquet and went to bed,
Leo followed his master's son-in-law with a drink, and gave it to him to drink,
in his hospitality the man said to him: "Say you, 
trusted servant of my father-in-law, so may you prosper,
when, indeed, will you carry out your desire
and take your master's horses and go to your own country?"

<!--
Hoc quasi ioco delectans dixit.
-->
He said this as if delighting in a jest.

<!--
Similiter et ille ioculariter respondens veritatem, ait: "Hac
nocte delibero, si Dei voluntas fuerit."
-->
Leo said, in similar vein and laughing, and answering truthfully:
"Tonight, I think, if God is willing."

<!--
Et ille: "Utinam," inquit, "custodiant me famuli mei, ne
aliquid de rebus meis adsumas."
-->
And he said: "Would that my slaves would protect me,
and keep you from taking any of my possessions."

<!--
Et ridentes discesserunt.
-->
And they parted, laughing.
</p>
 
<p>START</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Dormientibus autem cunctis, vocavit Leo Attalum, stratisque equitibus,
 interrogat si haberet gladium.
-->
But when everyone was asleep, Leo called Attalus,
and, after saddling the horses, asked if he had a sword.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Respondit: "Non est mihi necesse nisi tantum lancea parvula."
-->
He replied: "I have no need of one, except for only a very small lance.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
At ille ingressus mansionem domini sui, adprehendit scutum eius ac frameam.
-->
But Leo entered the house of his lord and seized his shield and spear.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quo interrogante quis esset aut quid sibi vellet respondit:
"Ego sum Leo, servus tuus, et suscito Attalo ut surgat velocius
et deducat equos ad pastum; detinetur enim sopore quasi ebrius."
-->
And when his master asked who he was and what he wanted, he replied:
"I am Leo, your slave, and I'm waking Attalus up so he'll get up quickly
and lead the horses to pasture; for he is held by sleep like a drunken man."
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Qui ait: "Fac ut libet."
-->
And he said: "Do as you wish."
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Et haec dicens obdormivit.
-->
And saying this he fell asleep.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Ille vero egressus foris, munivit puerum arma, invenitque
ianuas atrii divinitus reseratas, quas in initio noctis cum
cuneis malleo percussis obseraverat pro custodia caballorum;
et gratias agens Deo, sumptis reliquis equitibus secum,
discesserunt, unum etiam volucrum cum vestimentis tollentes.
-->
Indeed, when Leo went outside and armed the lad, he found
the gates of the courtyard, that, to protect the horses,
had been bolted shut at the beginning of the night with wedges hammered in,
opened by divine intervention;
and giving thanks to God, and taking the rest of the horses with them,
they left, also stealing one roll of clothing.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Venientes autem ad Mosella fluvium, ut transirent, cum
detinerentur a quibusdam, relictis equitibus et vestimentis,
enatantes super parma positi amnem, in ulteriorem egressi sunt
ripam, et inter obscura noctis ingressi silvas, latuerunt.
-->
But when they came to the Mosella River, in order to cross it after
being delayed by some men, they left the horses and clothes and
escaping by swimming upon a shield placed on the river,
they reached the far bank, and after entering the forest in the dark night, hid.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Tertia enim nox advenerat, quod nullum cibum gustantes iter terebant.
-->
For the third night had come, that they were tramping the road, tasting no food.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Tunc nutu Dei repertam arborem plenam pomis, qua vulgo pruna vocant,
 comedunt et parumper sustentati, ingressi sunt iter Campaniae.
-->
Then when they discovered, by God's will, a tree full of fruit, that the common
people call plums, they ate and, a little bit sustained,
began the journey to Campania.
</p>

<p>END</p>
