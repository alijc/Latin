<h4>AJC THE STORY OF ATTALUS</h4>

<p>AJC
<!--
Theudericus vero et Childebertus foedus inierunt et, dato
sibi sacramento, ut nullus contra alium moveretur, obsides ab
invicem acceperunt, quo facilius firmarentur quae fuerant dicta.
-->
Now Theudericus and Childebertus entered into a treaty and,
after pledging each other an oath that neither would move against the other,
accepted hostages from each another, by which means what had been declared
would be more easily confirmed.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Multi tunc filii senatorum in hac obsidione dati sunt; sed orto
iterum inter reges scandalum, ad servitium publicum sunt
addicti, et quicumque eos ad custodiendum accepit.
-->
Then many senators' sons were given into this captivity:
but after a quarrel rose up again between the kings
they were sentenced to common servitude, and anyone could take them
into custody.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Multi tamen ex eis per fugam lapsi, in patriam redierunt,
nonnulli in servitio sunt retenti.
-->
While many of them slipped away in flight and returned to their native land.
some were held fast in servitude.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Inter quos Attalus, nepos beati Gregorii, Lingonici
episcopi, ad publicum servitium mancipatus est custosque
equorum destinatus.
-->
Among these was Attalus, the nephew of the blessed Gregory, bishop of Langres.
He was given over into common servitude and sent to the horse stables.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Erat enim intra Treverici termini territorio cuidam barbaro serviens.
-->
For he was working in the territory of Treves for a foreign person.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Denique beatus Gregorius ad inquirendum cum pueros
destinavit, qui, inventum, obtulerunt homini munera.
-->
Finally, the blessed Gregory arranged for servants to investigate.
And when they found Attalus, they offered gifts to his master.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Sed respuit ea, dicens: "Hic tali generatione decem auri libras
redimi debet."
-->
But he rejected them, saying: "One of such birth needs ten pounds of
gold to be redeemed."
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quibus redeuntibus, Leo quidam ex coquina domini sui ait:
"Utinam me permitteres et forsitan ego poteram eum reducere
de captivitate."
-->
Upon their return, a certain Leo from their lord's kitchen said:
"If you would let me go, perhaps I could fetch him back from captivity."
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Gaviso autem domino, directus venit ad locum voluitque puerum
clam abstrahere sed non potuit.
-->
Now the lord was happy to do it, so straightway he went to the spot and wanted
to steal the boy away, but could not.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Tunc locatum secum hominem quendam ait: "Veni mecum et
venunda me in domo barbari illius, sitque tibi lucrum
pretium meum, tantum liberiorem aditum habeam faciendi id
quod decrevi."
-->
Then, bargaining with a certain man, he said: "Come with me and
sell me in the house of that foreigner, and let my price be a profit to you,
while I'll have freer access to do what I have resolved."
</p>
