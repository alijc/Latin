<h4>PREFACE TO BOOK V</h4>

<p>START</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Taedet me bellorum civilium diversitates quae Francorum gentem et regnum valde
proterunt memorare; in quo, quod peius est, tempore illud quod Dominus de
dolorum praedixit initium iam videmus: consurgit pater in filium, filius in
patrem, frater in fratrem, proximus in propinquum.
-->
It tires me to remember the details of the civil wars
that are crushing the people and kingdom of the Franks;
in which we already see what is evil, the beginning of the time
that the Lord foretold in sorrow: when
father rises up against son, son against father, brother against brother,
neighbor against neighbor.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Debebant enim eos exempla anteriorum regum terrere, qui, ut divisi, statim
ab inimicis sunt interempti.
-->
For the examples should have frightened the kings of old,
who, as they were divided, were at once destroyed by their enemies.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quotiens et ipsa urbs urbium et totius mundi caput iniens bella civilia,
diruit; quae cessante rursum quasi ex humo surrexit.
-->
As often as both the very city of cities and the head of the whole world,
in entering into civil wars, is razed;
it heedlessly rises again, as if out of the earth.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Utinam et vos, o reges, in his proelia in quibus parentes vestri
desudaverunt, exercemini ut gentes vestra pace conterritae,
vestris viribus premerentur.
-->
If only even you, o kings, would drill yourselves,
in these battles in which your parents exerted themselves,
like nations frightened by your union,
they would be hard-pressed by your power.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Recordamini quid caput victoriarum vestrarum Chlodovechus fecerit, qui
adversos reges interfecit, noxias gentes elisit, patrias subiugavit, quarum
regnum vobis integrum inlaesumque reliquit.
-->
Remember that the source of your victories was Clovis,
who killed the kings who fought him, crushed guilty nations, subjugated lands,
and from these left you a kingdom whole and unharmed.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Et cum hoc fecerit neque aurum neque argentum, sicut nunc est in thesauris
vestris, habebat.
-->
And when he did this he had neither the gold nor the silver
that's now in your treasuries.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quid agitis?
-->
What are you doing?
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quid quaeritis?
-->
What are you seeking?
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quid non abundatis?
-->
What are you lacking?
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
In domibus deliciae supercrescunt, in promptuariis vinum, triticum oleumque
redundat, in thesauris aurum atque argentum coacervatur.
-->
In your houses the luxuries multiply, in your storerooms the wine, wheat and
oil overflow, in your treasuries the gold and silver are heaped up.
</p>

<p>END</p>
