<h4>PREFACE TO BOOK V</h4>

<p>
<!--
Taedet me bellorum civilium diversitates quae Francorum gentem et regnum valde
proterunt memorare; in quo, quod peius est, tempore illud quod Dominus de
dolorum praedixit initium iam videmus: consurgit pater in filium, filius in
patrem, frater in fratrem, proximus in propinquum.
-->
It wearies me to remember the details of the civil wars
that are crushing the people and kingdom of the Franks.
We already see the evil in these,
the beginning of the time that the Lord sorrowfully foretold: when
father rises up against son, son against father, brother against brother,
neighbor against neighbor.

<!--
Debebant enim eos exempla anteriorum regum terrere, qui, ut divisi, statim
ab inimicis sunt interempti.
-->
For they should have been frightened by the examples of the kings of old,
who, as they were divided, were at once destroyed by their enemies.

<!--
Quotiens et ipsa urbs urbium et totius mundi caput iniens bella civilia,
diruit; quae cessante rursum quasi ex humo surrexit.
-->
As often as this very city, the chief of cities and of the whole world,
in entering into civil wars, was demolished;
when they were over it rose again, as if out of the earth.

<!--
Utinam et vos, o reges, in his proelia in quibus parentes vestri
desudaverunt, exercemini ut gentes vestra pace conterritae,
vestris viribus premerentur.
-->
If only even you, o kings, would be trained in
the battles that your parents exerted themselves in,
so that the nations, frightened by your union,
will be overwhelmed by your power.

<!--
Recordamini quid caput victoriarum vestrarum Chlodovechus fecerit, qui
adversos reges interfecit, noxias gentes elisit, patrias subiugavit, quarum
regnum vobis integrum inlaesumque reliquit.
-->
Remember what the fountainhead of your victories, Clovis, did.
He killed the kings who fought him, crushed guilty nations, subjugated lands,
and from these left you a kingdom whole and complete.

<!--
Et cum hoc fecerit neque aurum neque argentum, sicut nunc est in thesauris
vestris, habebat.
-->
And when he did this he had neither the gold nor the silver
that's now in your treasuries.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quid agitis?
-->
What are you doing?
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quid quaeritis?
-->
What are you seeking?
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quid non abundatis?
-->
What are you lacking?
</p>

<p>
<!--
In domibus deliciae supercrescunt, in promptuariis vinum, triticum oleumque
redundat, in thesauris aurum atque argentum coacervatur.
-->
In your houses the luxuries multiply, in your storerooms the wine, wheat and
oil overflow, in your treasuries the gold and silver are heaped up.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Unum vobis deest, quod pacem non habentes, Dei gratiam indigetis.
-->
Only one thing eludes you, that, as you have no peace,
you lack the grace of God.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Cur unus tollit alteri suum?
-->
Why does one man steal another's possessions?
</p>

<p>
<!--
Cur alter concupiscit alienum?
-->
Why does that man covet someone else's?
</p>

<p>
<!--
Cavete illo, quaeso, apostoli: 
"Si ab invicem mordetis et comeditis, videte ne ab invicem consumamini."
-->
I beg you, guard against this, from the apostle:
"If you bite and devour each other,
look out that you not be devoured by each other."

<!--
Scrutamini diligenter veterum scripta et videbitis quid civilia bella parturiant.
-->
Carefully examine what the ancients have written and you will see what civil
wars produce.

<!--
Requirite quod de Carthaginiensibus scribat Orosius,
qui cum post septingentos annos subversam dicat,
civitatem et regionem eorum, addidit:  
"Quae res eam tamdiu servavit?
-->
Seek out what was written about the Carthaginians by Orosius,
who, when describing the toppled city and its country after seven hundred years,
added: "What protected her for so long?
</p>

<p>
<!--
Concordiam.
-->
Harmony.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quae res eam post tanta distruxit tempora?
-->
What destroyed her after such a long time?
</p>

<p>
<!--
Discordiam." 
-->
Discord."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Cavete discordiam, cavete bella civilia, quae, vos populumque vestrum expugnant.
-->
Beware discord, beware civil wars, which destroy you and your people.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quid aliud sperandum erit nisi cum exercitus vester ceciderit vos sine
solacio relicti atque a gentibus adversis oppressi, protinus conruatis?
-->
What else will you hope for if, after your army has fallen,
you, left without solace and oppressed by hostile nations,
are not at once ruined?
</p>

<p>
<!--
Si tibi, o rex, bellum civile delectat, illud quod apostolus in hominem agi
meminit exerce, ut spiritus concupiscat adversus carnem, 
et vitia virtutibus cedant, et tu liber capiti tuo, 
id est Christo, servias, qui quondam radicem malorum servieras conpeditus.
-->
If you, o king, take delight in civil war, practice what 
the apostle thought a man should do, to long for the spirit over the body.
May your sins yield to virtues, and may you, as free man, serve your chief,
that is Christ, as you once, in bondage, served the root of evils.
