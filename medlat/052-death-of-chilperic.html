<h4>The Death of Chilperic</h4>

<p>
<!--
His itaque cum hac praeda pergentibus, Chilpericus, Nero nostri
temporis et Herodis, ad villam Calensem, quae distat ab urbe Parisiaca
quasi centum stadiis, accedit; ibique venationes exercet.
-->
And so, while these men continued on with this loot,
Chilperic, the Nero and the Herod of our time,
approached the estate of Calensa, which is about one hundred furlongs
from the city of Paris; and there he engaged in hunting.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quadam vero die regressus de venatione iam subobscura nocte, dum
de equo susciperetur et unam manum super scapulam pueri retineret,
adveniens quidam eum cultro percutit sub ascellam iteratoque ictu
ventrem eius perforat; statimque profluente copia sanguinis tam per os
quam per aditum vulneris,
iniquum fudit spiritum.
-->
And, indeed, after returning from the hunt one day in the gathering night,
while being assisted down from his horse and holding fast to the boy's
shoulder with one hand,
someone came at him and struck him under the arm with a knife
and pierced him in the stomach with a second blow;
and he at once poured out his unjust life,
with copious amounts of blood flowing forth, more from his mouth
than from the entrance of the wound.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quam vero malitiam gesserit superior lectio docet.
-->
Truly, the above narrative shows what malice he bore.

<!--
Nam regiones plurimas saepius devastavit atque succendit; de
quibus nihil doloris sed laetitiam magis habebat, sicut, quondam Nero,
cum inter incendia palatii tragoedas decantaret.
-->
For he often devastated and burnt many regions:
he had no sorrow at all about these, but a yet greater joy,
just like Nero in days of old,
when he sang tragedies in his palace during the fire.

<!--
Persaepe homines pro facultatibus eorum iniuste punivit.
-->
He very often unjustly punished men for their abilities.

<!--
In cuius tempore pauci quodammodo episcopatum clerici meruerunt.
-->
And in his time very few clerics gained bishorics.

<!--
Erat enim gulae deditus, cuius deus venter fuit.
-->
For he was devoted to his gullet, and his god was his stomach.

<!--
Nullumque sibi adserebat esse prudentiorem.
-->
And he claimed that no-one was wiser than himself.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Confecitque duos libros, quasi Sedulium meditatus, quorum versiculi
debiles nullis pedibus subsistere possunt; in quibus, dum non
intellegebat, pro longis
syllabas breves posuit et pro breves longas statuebat; et alia
opuscula vel hymnos sive missas, quae nulla ratione suscipi possunt.
-->
And he made two books, modeled on Sedulius, in which weak little
verses could not stand on their own feet; in which,
as he had no understanding, he put short syllables instead of long ones,
and set long ones instead of short;
and composed other trifles, hymns and masses,
which were on no account acceptable.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Causas pauperum exosas habebat.
-->
He hated poor men.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Sacerdotes Domini adsidue blasphemabat nec aliunde magis, dum
secretius esset, exercebat ridicula vel iocos quam de ecclesiarum
episcopis.
-->
He constantly reviled the Lord's priests, and when in private
made jokes or jests on no subject other than the churchs' bishops.

<!--
Illum ferebat levem, alium superbum, illum abundantem, istum
luxuriosum; illum adserebat elatum, hunc tumidum; nullum plus odio
quam ecclesias habens.
-->
He would call that one trivial, another arrogant, that one over-rich,
the other self-indugent; he claimed that that one was haughty,
this one swollen with pride;
nothing was more hateful to him than the churches.

<!--
Aiebat enim plerumque:  "Ecce pauper remansit fiscus noster, ecce
divitiae nostrae ad ecclesias sunt translatae: nulli penitus nisi soli
episcopi regnant; periet honor noster et translatus est ad episcopos
civitatum."
-->
For he frequently said: "Look, our exchequer is still meager, look,
our riches have been transferred to the churches: no-one rules in there
but bishops; our honor has been laid waste and transferred to the
bishops of the towns."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Haec agens adsidue testamenta quae in ecclesias conscripta erant
plerumque disrupit ipsasque patris sui praeceptiones, putans quod non
remaneret qui voluntatem eius servaret, saepe calcavit.
-->
While constantly saying these things,
he frequently broke the wills that had been written in churches' favor
as well as those of his father's legacies, and often trod them underfoot,
thinking that none was left that served his purpose.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Iam de libidine atque luxuria non potest reperiri in cogitatione
quod non perpetrasset in opere, novaque semper ad laedendum populum
ingenia perquaerebat; nam, si quos hoc tempore culpabiles repperisset,
oculos eis iubebat erui.
-->
Not one thought of lust and extravagance can be invented
that he hadn't already done in deed,
and he was always searching for new tricks for injuring his people.
Indeed, in recent years, if he'd found them guilty,
he would order their eyes to be plucked out.

<!--
Et in praeceptionibus quas ad iudices pro suis utilitatibus
dirigebat haec addebat: "Si quis praecepta nostra contempserit,
oculorum avulsione multetur."
-->
And he would direct legacies that advantaged himself to the judges,
adding these words: "If anyone disregards our commands,
let him be punished by tearing out his eyes."

<!--
Nullum umquam pure dilexit, a nullo dilectus est; ideoque cum
spiritum exalasset, omnes eum reliquerunt sui.
-->
Not a single person did he sincerely hold dear, by none was he held dear;
and so after he breathed his last, everyone abandoned him.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Mallulfus autem Silvanectensis episcopus, qui iam tertia die in
tentorio residebat et ipsum videre non poterat, ut eum interemptum
audivit, advenit; ablutumque vestimentis melioribus induit, noctem in
hymnis deductam, in nave levavit et in basilica sancti Vincenti, quae
est Parisius, sepelivit, Fredegunde regina in ecclesia derelicta.
-->
But after Mallulfus, the bishop of Senlis, who had already spent three days
staying in a tent, unable to see him, heard that he'd been killed,
he came.
And after he washed his body and put better clothes on it, and
passed the night in hymns, he laid him in state in the nave,
and interred him in the basilica of Saint Vincent, which is in Paris.
Queen Fredegunde was left behind in the church.
