<h4>The Death of Chilperic</h4>
 
<p>START</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
His itaque cum hac praeda pergentibus, Chilpericus, Nero nostri
temporis et Herodis, ad villam Calensem, quae distat ab urbe Parisiaca
quasi centum stadiis, accedit; ibique venationes exercet.
-->
And so, while these men continued on with this loot,
Chilperic, the Nero and the Herod of our time,
approached the estate of Calensa, which is about one hundred furlongs
from the city of Paris; and there he engaged in hunting.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quadam vero die regressus de venatione iam subobscura nocte, dum
de equo susciperetur et unam manum super scapulam pueri retineret,
adveniens quidam eum cultro percutit sub ascellam iteratoque ictu
ventrem eius perforat; statimque profluente copia sanguinis tam per os
quam per aditum vulneris,
iniquum fudit spiritum.
-->
And, indeed, after returning from the hunt one day in the gathering night,
while being assisted down from his horse and holding fast to the boy's
shoulder with one hand,
a certain man came at him and struck him under the arm with a knife
and pierced him in the stomach with a second blow;
and he at once poured out his unjust life,
with copious amounts of blood flowing forth, more from his mouth
than from the entrance of the wound.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quam vero malitiam gesserit superior lectio docet.
-->
Truly, the above narrative shows what malice he bore.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Nam regiones plurimas saepius devastavit atque succendit; de
quibus nihil doloris sed laetitiam magis habebat, sicut, quondam Nero,
cum inter incendia palatii tragoedas decantaret.
-->
For he often devastated and burnt many regions:
he had no sorrow at all about these, but a yet greater joy,
just like Nero in days of old,
when he sang tragedies in his palace during the fire.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Persaepe homines pro facultatibus eorum iniuste punivit.
-->
He very often unjustly punished men for their abilities.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
In cuius tempore pauci quodammodo episcopatum clerici meruerunt.
-->
And in his time very few clerics gained bishorics.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Erat enim gulae deditus, cuius deus venter fuit.
-->
For he was devoted to his gullet, and his god was his stomach.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Nullumque sibi adserebat esse prudentiorem.
-->
And he claimed that no-one was more skilled than himself.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Confecitque duos libros, quasi Sedulium meditatus, quorum versiculi
debiles nullis pedibus subsistere possunt; in quibus, dum non
intellegebat, pro longis
syllabas breves posuit et pro breves longas statuebat; et alia
opuscula vel hymnos sive missas, quae nulla ratione suscipi possunt.
-->
And he made books, modeled on Sedulius, in which weak little
verses could not stand on their own feet; in which,
as he had no understanding, he put short syllables instead of long ones,
and and set long ones instead of short;
and composed other trifles, hymns and masses,
which were on no account acceptable.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Causas pauperum exosas habebat.
-->
He hated poor men.
