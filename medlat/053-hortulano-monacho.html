<!--LII DE HORTULANO MONACHO MONASTERII EIUSDEM-->
<h4>On a Gardener, a Monk in the Same Monastery</h4>
<!--
Gregorius.  Felix, qui appellatur Curvus, quem ipse bene nosti, qui
eiusdem monasterii nuper praepositus fuit, multa mihi de fratribus
eiusdem monasterii admiranda narrabat;
ex quibus aliqua quae ad memoriam veniunt supprimo, quia ad alia festino.
-->
Gregory.  Felix, who is called Curvus, whom you yourself know well,
was recently placed in command of the same monastery.
He used to tell me many wonders about the brothers of the same monastery;
I hold back a few of these that come to mind, because I hasten to others.

<!--
Sed unum dicam quod ab eo narratum praetereundum nullo modo aestimo.
-->
But I'll tell one of his stories that I don't think should be at all neglected.

<p>
<!--
In eodem monasterio, quidam magnae vitae monachus erat hortulanus.
-->
In the same monastery, a certain monk of great life was the gardener.

<!--
Fur vero venire consueverat, per saepem ascendere et occulte holera auferre.
-->
Indeed, a thief used to come and climb over the fence and
secretly steal vegetables.

<!--
Cumque ille multa plantaret, quae minus inveniret, et alia pedibus
conculcata, alia direpta conspiceret, totum hortum circumiens, invenit
iter unde fur venire consueverat.
-->
And although the monk planted many things,
he couldn't find some of them,
and he noticed some trampled underfoot, with others uprooted.
Going round the whole garden, he found the path where the thief was wont to come in.

<!--
Qui in eodem horto deambulans, repperit etiam serpentem, cui
praecipiens dixit: "Sequere me," atque ad aditum furis perveniens,
imperavit serpenti, dicens: "In nomine Iesu praecipio tibi
ut aditum istum custodias ac furem huc ingredi non permittas."
-->
And as he was walking around in that garden, he also discovered a snake,
and gave it an order, saying: "Follow me."
And after reaching the place where the thief got in,
he commanded the snake, saying: "In the name of Jesus I order you
to guard this entrance and to keep the thief from getting through here."

<!--
Protinus serpens totum se in itinere in transversum tetendit et ad
cellam monachus rediit.
-->
The snake immediately stretched out full-length across the path,
and the monk returned to his cell.

<p>START</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Cumque meridiano tempore cuncti fratres quiescerent, more solito
fur advenit, ascendit saepem; et cum in hortum pedem deponeret vidit
subito quia tensus serpens clausisset viam, et
tremefactus post semetipsum concidit, eiusque pes per calceamentum in
sude saepis inhaesit sicque, usque dum hortulanus rediret, deorsum
capite pependit.
-->
And at midday, when all the brothers were resting,
the thief arrived in his customary habit and climbed the fence;
and when he swung his foot into the garden he saw with a start
that a snake was stretched out, blocking his way,
and all a tremble he fell over backwards,
and his foot in its shoe got stuck in a 
in a stake of the fence and so, until the gardener returned,
he was left hanging head down.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Consueta hora venit hortulanus, pendentem in saepe furem repperit,
serpenti autem dixit: "Gratias Deo, implesti quod iussi; recede modo."
-->
At the usual hour the gardener came, discovered the thief hanging on the fence,
and said to the snake: "Thanks be to God, you have discharged your duty;
leave us now."
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Qui statim abscessit.
-->
And he withdrew at once.
</p>

<p>END</p>
