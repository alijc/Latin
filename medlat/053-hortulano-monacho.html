<!--LII DE HORTULANO MONACHO MONASTERII EIUSDEM-->
<h4>On the Gardener Monk in the Same Monastery</h4>
<!--
Gregorius.  Felix, qui appellatur Curvus, quem ipse bene nosti, qui
eiusdem monasterii nuper praepositus fuit, multa mihi de fratribus
eiusdem monasterii admiranda narrabat;
ex quibus aliqua quae ad memoriam veniunt supprimo, quia ad alia festino.
-->
Gregory.  Felix, who is called Bent, whom you yourself know well,
was recently placed in command of his monastery.
He used to tell me many wonders about the brothers of his monastery;
I hold back a few of these that come to mind, because I hasten to others.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Sed unum dicam quod ab eo narratum praetereundum nullo modo aestimo.
-->
But I'll tell one of his stories that I don't think should be at all neglected.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
In eodem monasterio, quidam magnae vitae monachus erat hortulanus.
-->
In his monastery, a certain monk of great life was the gardener.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Fur vero venire consueverat, per saepem ascendere et occulte holera auferre.
-->
Indeed, a thief used to come and climb over the fence and
secretly steal vegetables.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Cumque ille multa plantaret, quae minus inveniret, et alia pedibus
conculcata, alia direpta conspiceret, totum hortum circumiens, invenit
iter unde fur venire consueverat.
-->
And while he was transplanting there were many that he couldn't find,
and he noticed some trampled underfoot, with others uprooted.
Going round the whole garden, he found the path where the thief would come.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Qui in eodem horto deambulans, repperit etiam serpentem, cui
praecipiens dixit: "Sequere me," atque ad aditum furis perveniens,
imperavit serpenti, dicens: "In nomine Iesu praecipio tibi
ut aditum istum custodias ac furem huc ingredi non permittas."
-->
And as he was strolling around his garden, he also discovered a serpent,
and ordering it, he said: "Follow me."
And after reaching the place where the thief got in,
he commanded the serpent, saying: "In the name of Jesus I order you
to guard this entrance and to keep the thief from getting through here."
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Protinus serpens totum se in itinere in transversum tetendit et ad
cellam monachus rediit.
-->
The snake immediately stretched out across the path,
and the monk returned to his cell.
</p>

<p>END</p>
