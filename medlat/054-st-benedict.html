<h4>ST.  BENEDICT</h4>
<p>
<!--
Fuit vir vitae venerabilis, gratia Benedictus et nomine,
ab ipso suae pueritiae tempore cor gerens senile.
-->
There was a man of a venerable way of life, Blessed in grace and name,
who bore an ancient heart from the time he was a child.

<!--
Aetatem quippe moribus transiens, nulli animum voluptati dedit sed dum in
hac terra adhuc esset, quo temporaliter libere uti potuisset, despexit
iam quasi aridum mundum cum flore.
-->
Passing his lifetime morally in all ways,
he gave his soul to no pleasure so long as he was on this earth,
where it was possible to freely make use of this world,
which he already disdained, as if it were a blossom in a waterless world.

<!--
Qui, liberiori genere ex provincia Nursiae exortus, 
Romae liberalibus litterarum studiis traditus fuerat.
-->
And he, a gentleman by birth risen from the province of Nursia,
had been delivered to Rome by a liberal zeal for letters.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Sed cum in eis multos ire per abrupta vitiorum cerneret,
eum quem quasi in ingressu mundi posuerat, retraxit pedem ne,
si quid de scientia eius attingeret, 
ipse quoque postmodum in immane praecipitium totus iret.
-->
But when he discerned in them that many men walk along precipices of faults,
it set him as if on the threshold of the world, and
he drew his foot back for fear that if he acheived anything of this knowledge,
he himself would, in time, go tumbling head over heels down the cliff as well.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Despectis itaque litterarum studiis, relicta domo rebusque patris, 
soli Deo placere desiderans, sanctae conversationis habitum quaesivit.
-->
And so, disdaining the studies of literature,
he abandoned his father's home and affairs.
Desiring only to please God, he sought the garb of a holy monastic life.

<!--
Recessit igitur scienter nescius, et sapienter indoctus.
-->
Therefore he retired, knowingly ignorant and wisely unlearned.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Huius ego omnia gesta non didici sed pauca quae narro quattuor
discipulis illius referentibus agnovi: Constantino scilicet reverentissimo
valde viro, qui ei in monasterii regimine successit; Valentiniano quoque, qui
annis multis Lateranensi monasterio praefuit; Simplicio, qui congregationem
illius post eum tertius rexit; Honorato etiam, qui nunc adhuc cellae eius in
qua prius conversatus fuerat, praeest.
-->
I didn't find out about all of his deeds, but I'm relating a few that I
learned from four of his pupils:
namely, the most reverent Constantine,
who succeeded him in the command of the monastery;
Valentine as well, who was in charge of the Lateranian monastery for many years;
Simplicius, who was the third to govern the brotherhood after him;
and also Honoratus, who is in charge of the cell that he'd lived in until now.
