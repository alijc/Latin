<!--DE SIMULATIONE REGIS TOTILAE DEPREHENSA-->
<h4>On the Revelation of King Totila's Deceit</h4>

<p>AJC
<!--
Gothorum temporibus cum rex eorum Totila sanctum virum prophetiae  habere
spiritum audisset, ad eius monasterium pergens, paulo longius substitit eique
se venturum esse nuntiavit.
-->
In the times of the Goths,
after their king Totila heard that a holy man had a prophetic soul,
he went to his monastery and halted a little way away
and sent word that he had come to visit him.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Cui dum protinus mandatum de monasterio fuisset ut veniret ipse, sicut
perfidae mentis fuit, an vir Dei prophetiae spiritum haberet explorare conatus
est.
-->
He commanded the man to come to him from the monastery immediately,
but in the meantime, since he was of a deceitful bent,
he endeavored to test whether a man of God could have a prophetic soul.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quidam vero eius spatharius Riggo dicebatur, cui calceamenta sua praebuit
eumque indui vestibus regalibus fecit, quem quasi in persona sua pergere ad
Dei hominem praecepit.
-->
Now a certain man, called Riggo, was his swordbearer.
The king gave him his own shoes and made him get dressed in royal garments,
and instructed him to proceed to the man of God as if in his own person.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
In cuius obsequio tres, qui sibi prae ceteris adhaerere consueverant,
comites misit, scilicet, Vulteric, Ruderic et Blidin, ut ante servi Dei
oculos, ipsum regem Totilam esse simulantes, eius lateribus obambularent; cui
alia quoque obsequia atque spatharios praebuit ut tam ex eisdem obsequiis
quam ex purpureis vestibus rex esse putaretur.
-->
And he sent three counts in his retinue,
namely Vulteric, Ruderic and Blidin,
who were accustomed to stick close to him in front of everyone else,
to walk beside Riggo before the eyes of the servant of God,
pretending that he was King Totila.
And he also gave him attendants and swordbearers
so that he'd be taken as the king, as much from these same attendants
as from his purple garments.
