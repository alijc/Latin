<!--DE SIMULATIONE REGIS TOTILAE DEPREHENSA-->
<h4>On the Revelation of King Totila's Deceit</h4>

<p>
<!--
Gothorum temporibus cum rex eorum Totila sanctum virum prophetiae  habere
spiritum audisset, ad eius monasterium pergens, paulo longius substitit eique
se venturum esse nuntiavit.
-->
In the times of the Goths,
after their king Totila heard that a holy man had a spirit of prophecy,
he went to his monastery and halted a little way away
and sent word that he had come to visit him.

<!--
Cui dum protinus mandatum de monasterio fuisset ut veniret ipse, sicut
perfidae mentis fuit, an vir Dei prophetiae spiritum haberet explorare conatus
est.
-->
And as soon as the commission from the monastery came for him to come,
since he was of a deceitful bent,
he endeavored to test whether the man of God did have a spirit of prophecy.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quidam vero eius spatharius Riggo dicebatur, cui calceamenta sua praebuit
eumque indui vestibus regalibus fecit, quem quasi in persona sua pergere ad
Dei hominem praecepit.
-->
Now a certain man, called Riggo, was his swordbearer.
The king gave him his own shoes and had him dressed in royal garments,
and instructed him to proceed to the man of God as if in his own person.

<!--
In cuius obsequio tres, qui sibi prae ceteris adhaerere consueverant,
comites misit, scilicet, Vulteric, Ruderic et Blidin, ut ante servi Dei
oculos, ipsum regem Totilam esse simulantes, eius lateribus obambularent; cui
alia quoque obsequia atque spatharios praebuit ut tam ex eisdem obsequiis
quam ex purpureis vestibus rex esse putaretur.
-->
And he sent three counts in his retinue,
namely Vulteric, Ruderic and Blidin,
who were accustomed to stick close to him in front of everyone else,
to walk beside Riggo before the eyes of the servant of God,
pretending that he was King Totila.
And he also gave him attendants and swordbearers
so that he'd be taken as the king, as much from these same attendants
as from his purple garments.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Cumque idem Riggo, decoratus vestibus, obsequentum frequentia comitatus,
monasterium fuisset ingressus, vir Dei eminus sedebat.
-->
And after this same Riggo, distinguished with robes
and accompanied by a large retinue of attendants,
entered the monastery, the man of God was sitting some ways away.

<!--
Quem venientem conspiciens, cum iam ab eo audiri potuisset clamavit,
dicens: "Pone, fili, pone hoc quod portas; non est tuum.
-->
And he observed the new arrival,
and cried out as soon as he got within earshot, saying:
"My son, take off what you're wearing; it is not yours.

<!--
Qui Riggo protinus in terram cecidit et quia tanto viro illudere
praesumpsisset expavit, omnesque qui cum eo ad hominem Dei
veniebant terrae consternati sunt.
-->
And this Riggo immediately fell to the ground in fear
for presuming to mock such a man,
and all who were coming with him to the man of God
fell on the ground in consternation.

<!--
Surgentes autem ad eum propinquare minime praesumpserunt, sed ad suum regem
reversi, nuntiaverunt trepidi in quanta velocitate fuerant deprehensi.
-->
Then they got up and dared to approach a bit closer to him,
but after they returned to their king,
the frightened men reported how quickly they'd been exposed.
