<!--DE PRESBYTERO PROVINCIAE VALERIAE QUI FUREM AD SEPULCHRUM SUUM TENUIT-->
<h4>On a Priest of the Province of Valeria, Who Held a Thief at his Grave</h4>

<p>
<!--
In Valeria namque provincia res est haec gesta quam narro, mihique
beatae memoriae abbatis mei Valentionis relatione cognita.
-->
Now it was in the province of Valeria that the matter that I'm relating happened,
and was made known to me by the account of my abbot Valentine
of blessed memory.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Ibi etenim quidam venerabilis sacerdos erat, qui cum clericis suis,
Dei laudibus bonisque operibus intentus, sanctae conversationis vitam
ducebat.
-->
Indeed, there was a certain venerable priest there, who, along with his clerks,
earnest in the glories of God and good works, led a life of pious conduct.

<!--
Superveniente autem vocationis suae die, defunctus est atque ante
ecclesiam sepultus.
-->
Now when the day of his death came, he passed away and was buried in front of
the church.

<!--
Eidem vero ecclesiae caulae inhaerebant ovium, atque idem locus in
quo sepultus est ad easdem oves tendentibus pervius erat.
-->
Indeed, there was a sheepfold next to that same church, and if they strained,
those sheep could get into where he was buried.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quadam autem nocte cum clericis intra ecclesiam psallentibus, fur
venisset ut ingressus caulas furtum faceret, vervecem tulit, et
concitus
exiit.
-->
Now one night, when the clerics were inside the church singing psalms,
a thief came to enter the sheepfold to commit a theft. He stole a wether
and quickly left.

<!--
Cum vero pervenisset ad locum ubi vir Domini sepultus erat, repente
haesit et gressum movere non potuit.
-->
And when he got to the place where the man of God was buried,
he suddenly got stuck fast and couldn't move a step.

<!--
Vervecem quidem de collo deposuit eumque dimittere voluit, sed
manum laxare non valuit.
-->
Indeed, he let the wether drop from his neck and wanted to release it,
but was not able to open his hand.
</p>

<p>START</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Coepit igitur stare miser cum praeda sua, reus et ligatus.
-->
And so the wretch commenced to stand still with his loot, bound and guilty.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Volebat vervecem dimittere, nec valebat; volebat egredi cum
vervece, nec poterat.
-->
He wanted to put the wether down, but wasn't able to;
he wanted to leave with the wether, but couldn't.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Miro itaque modo fur, qui a vivis videri timuerat, hunc mortuus tenebat.
-->
And so in an extraordinary way the thief, who feared being seen by living men,
was held by a dead man.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Cumque ita gressus manusque illius fuissent obstricta, immobilis perstitit.
-->
And after his feet and hands were bound thus, he stood, immobile.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Facto autem mane expletisque laudibus Dei, ab ecclesia egressi sunt
clerici et invenerunt ignotum hominem vervecem tenentem manu.
-->
But went day broke and the praises of God were finished,
the clerics came out of the church and
discovered a strange man holding a wether in his hand.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Res venit in dubium utrum vervecem tolleret an offerret, sed culpae
reus citius indicavit poenam.
-->
The matter came into doubt whether he'd stolen the wether, or was bestowing it,
but guilty of crime more quickly he pointed out the punishment.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Mirati omnes quia ingressus fur viri Dei merito ad praedam suam
stabat ligatus.
-->
All were amazed that the thief having entered of the man of God deservedly
to/at his loot he was standing bound.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Qui se pro eo protinus in orationem dederunt, suisque precibus vix
obtinere valuerunt ut, qui res eorum venerat rapere, saltem vacuus
exire mereretur.
-->
And they themselves before him at once gave speech, and by their prayers barely
to get they availed that, he who had come to carry off their property,
at least empty/free earned to go.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Itaque fur, qui diu steterat cum praeda captivus, quandoque exiit
vacuus et liber.
-->
And so the thief, who captured long had stood still with the loot,
and when/whenever he went away free and free.
</p>

<p>END</p>
