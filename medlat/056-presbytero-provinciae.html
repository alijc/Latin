<!--DE PRESBYTERO PROVINCIAE VALERIAE QUI FUREM AD SEPULCHRUM SUUM TENUIT-->
<h4>On a Priest of the Province of Valeria, Who Held a Thief at his Grave</h4>

<p>
<!--
In Valeria namque provincia res est haec gesta quam narro, mihique
beatae memoriae abbatis mei Valentionis relatione cognita.
-->
Now it was in the province of Valeria that the matter that I'm relating happened,
and was made known to me by the account of my abbot Valentine
of blessed memory.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Ibi etenim quidam venerabilis sacerdos erat, qui cum clericis suis,
Dei laudibus bonisque operibus intentus, sanctae conversationis vitam
ducebat.
-->
Indeed, there was a certain venerable priest there, who, along with his clerks,
earnest in the glories of God and good works, led a life of pious conduct.

<!--
Superveniente autem vocationis suae die, defunctus est atque ante
ecclesiam sepultus.
-->
Now when the day of his death came, he passed away and was buried in front of
the church.

<!--
Eidem vero ecclesiae caulae inhaerebant ovium, atque idem locus in
quo sepultus est ad easdem oves tendentibus pervius erat.
-->
Indeed, there was a sheepfold next to that same church, and if they strained,
those sheep could get into where he was buried.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quadam autem nocte cum clericis intra ecclesiam psallentibus, fur
venisset ut ingressus caulas furtum faceret, vervecem tulit, et
concitus
exiit.
-->
Now one night, when the clerics were inside the church singing psalms,
a thief came to enter the sheepfold to commit a theft. He stole a wether
and quickly left.

<!--
Cum vero pervenisset ad locum ubi vir Domini sepultus erat, repente
haesit et gressum movere non potuit.
-->
And when he got to the place where the man of God was buried,
he suddenly got stuck fast and couldn't move a step.

<!--
Vervecem quidem de collo deposuit eumque dimittere voluit, sed
manum laxare non valuit.
-->
Indeed, he let the wether drop from his neck and wanted to release it,
but was not able to open his hand.
