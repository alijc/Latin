<!--Gregorius Candido Presbytero Eunti ad Patrimonium Galliae-->
<h4>Gregory to the Priest Candidus, Going to the Church of Gaul</h4>

<p>
<!--
Pergens, auxiliante Domino Deo nostro Iesu Christo, ad patrimonium quod est
in Galliis gubernandum, volumus ut dilectio tua ex solidis quos acceperit
vestimenta pauperum vel pueros Anglos qui sunt ab annis decem et septem vel
decem et octo, ut in monasteriis dati Deo proficiant, comparet quatenus
solidi Galliarum, qui in terra nostra expendi non possunt, apud locum
proprium utiliter expendantur.
-->
As you are going, with our Lord God Jesus Christ aiding,
to manage the church in the Gaulish lands,
we ask that your dear self, from the gold coins that you will receive,
purchase clothing for the poor or seventeen or eighteen year old English boys,
who should do well in monasteries after being given to God,
since Gaulish gold coins, which cannot be spent in our own land,
might be usefully spent in their own region.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Si quid vero de pecuniis redituum quae dicuntur ablatae recipere potueris,
ex his quoque vestimenta pauperum comparare te volumus vel, sicut praefati
sumus, pueros qui in omnipotentis Dei servitio proficiant.
-->
Indeed, if you can recover any of the money that is said to have been stolen,
from this also we would like you to secure clothing for the poor, or,
as we have already said,
boys who might do well in the service of the almighty God.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Sed quia pagani sunt qui illic inveniri possunt volo ut cum eis presbyter
transmittatur ne quid aegritudinis contingat in via, ut quos morituros
conspexerit debeat baptizare.
-->
But because those who are found in that place are pagans,
I hope that a priest will be sent with them,
so that if some disease touches them on the road,
he'd be responsible for baptizing those who were about to die.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Ita igitur tua dilectio faciat ut haec diligenter implere festinet.
-->
Therefore may your dear self make haste to diligently complete these matters.
