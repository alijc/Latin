<!--GREGORIUS DESIDERIO EPISCOPO GALLIAE-->
<h4>AJC  Gregorius to Desiderius, Bishop of Gaul</h4>

<p>AJC
<!--
Cum multa nobis bona de vestris fuissent studiis nuntiata, ita cordi
nostro nata est laetitia, ut negare ea quae sibi fraternitas vestra
concedenda poposcerat minime pateremur.
-->
As many good things about your devotions have been reported to us,
so joy has sprung forth in our heart, that we might not at all suffer to 
to deny those things that you, my dear brother, had asked to be granted to you.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Sed post hoc pervenit ad nos (quod sine verecundia memorare non
possumus) fraternitatem tuam grammaticam quibusdam exponere.
-->
But after this it was reported to us (which we cannot recount without shame)
that you, my dear brother, were expounding philology to some people.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quam rem ita moleste suscepimus ac sumus vehementius aspernati ut
ea quae prius dicta fuerant in gemitum et tristitiam verteremus, quia
in uno se ore cum Iovis laudibus Christi laudes non capiunt.
-->
Now we received this news with such annoyance and rejected it so much
that we changed what had been previously said into a sigh and sadness, since
Christ's praises don't hold themselves in the same speech as Jove's praises.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Et quam grave nefandumque sit episcopis canere quod nec laico
religioso conveniat, ipse considera.
-->
Consider how serious and impious it would be for a bishop to recite what
would not be appropriate for a devout layman.
</p>
