<!--GREGORIUS DESIDERIO EPISCOPO GALLIAE-->
<h4>Gregorius to Desiderius, Bishop of Gaul</h4>

<p>
<!--
Cum multa nobis bona de vestris fuissent studiis nuntiata, ita cordi
nostro nata est laetitia, ut negare ea quae sibi fraternitas vestra
concedenda poposcerat minime pateremur.
-->
As many good things about your devotions have been reported to us,
joy has thus sprung forth in our heart, that we might not at all suffer to 
to deny those things that you, my dear brother, had asked to be granted to you.

<!--
Sed post hoc pervenit ad nos (quod sine verecundia memorare non
possumus) fraternitatem tuam grammaticam quibusdam exponere.
-->
But after this it was reported to us (which we cannot recount without shame)
that you, my dear brother, were expounding philology to some people.

<!--
Quam rem ita moleste suscepimus ac sumus vehementius aspernati ut
ea quae prius dicta fuerant in gemitum et tristitiam verteremus, quia
in uno se ore cum Iovis laudibus Christi laudes non capiunt.
-->
Now we received this news with such annoyance and rejected it so strongly
that we changed what had been previously said into a sigh and sadness, since
Christ's praises don't hold themselves in the same mouth as Jove's praises.

<!--
Et quam grave nefandumque sit episcopis canere quod nec laico
religioso conveniat, ipse considera.
-->
Consider how serious and impious it would be for a bishop to recite what
would not be appropriate for a devout layman.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Et quamvis dilectissimus filius noster Candidus presbyter postmodum
veniens, hac de re subtiliter requisitus, negaverit atque conatus vos
fuerit excusare, de nostris tamen adhuc animis non recessit quia quanto
exsecrabile
est hoc de sacerdote enarrari tanto utrum ita necne sit districta et
veraci oportet satisfactione cognosci.
-->
And although our most beloved son Candidus, the presbyter,
came to us a little while later
and was questioned rather strictly about this matter,
he denied it and tried to make excuses for you,
yet nonetheless did not retire from our souls
for it is so detestable to recount this about a priest,
whether or not he is such,
and in truth it must to be examined with a strict penalty.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Unde si post hoc evidenter ea quae ad nos perlata sunt falsa esse
claruerint nec vos nugis et saecularibus litteris studere constiterit,
Deo nostro gratias agimus, qui cor vestrum maculari blasphemis
nefandorum laudibus non permisit, et de concedendis quae poscitis
securi iam et sine aliqua dubitatione tractabimus.
-->
Wherefore, if it afterwards becomes clear that we were deceived
in the matters which were reported to us,
and it was not correct that you busied yourself
with frivolities and worldly literature,
we give thanks to our God, who did not permit your heart to be dishonored with
the blasphemies of impious praises,
and will, untroubled and without any doubt,
quickly manage granting the things that you request.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Monachos vero quos una cum dilectissimo filio nostro Laurentio
presbytero et Mellito abbate ad reverendissimum fratrem et coepiscopum
nostrum Augustinum transmisimus, vobis in omnibus
commendamus ut, fraternitate vestra solaciante, nulla illos ad
proficiscendum mora valeat impedire.
-->
Indeed, we entrust to you in everything the monks whom we have sent over,
together with our most dear son the elder Laurentius and the abbot Mellitus
to most venerable brother and our fellow bishop Augustine,
so that, with your aid, my dear brother,
no delay might be able to hinder their departure.
