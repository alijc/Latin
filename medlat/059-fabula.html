<h4>About the Fable</h4>

<p>AJC
<!--
Fabulas poetae a fando nominaverunt, 
quia non sunt res factae, sed tantum loquendo fictae.
-->
  Poets have called fables, from what is to be spoken,
  because they are not matters of fact, but only fictions to be spoken.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quae ideo sunt inductae ut fictorum mutorum animalium inter se conloquio
imago quaedam vitae hominum nosceretur.
-->
  For that reason these are introduced so that, by means of fictional dumb
  animals speaking among themselves, the likeness of a certain mode of life of
  men might be recognized.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Has primus invenisse traditur Alcmaeon Crotoniensis, appellanturque Aesopiae,
quia is apud Phrygas in hac re polluit.
-->
  It is related that Alcmaeon of Croton first invented these,
  and they are called the Aesopica, for he defiled at Phrygia in this matter.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Sunt autem fabulae aut Aesopicae aut Lybisticae.
-->
But the fables are either the Aesopica or the Lybistica.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Aesopicae sunt cum animalia muta inter se sermocinasse finguntur, vel quae
animam non habent, ut urbes, arbores, montes, petrae, flumina.
-->
  The Aesopica are when dumb animals are contrived to converse among
  themselves, or things that don't have an soul, like cities, trees, mountains,
  rocks, or rivers. 
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Lybisticae autem, dum hominum cum bestiis aut bestiarum cum hominibus
fingitur vocis esse commercium.
-->
  But the Lybistica are when the spoken fellowship of men with beasts or of
  beasts with men is contrived.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Fabulas poetae quasdam delectandi causa finxerunt, quasdam ad naturam
rerum, nonnullas ad mores hominum interpretati sunt.
-->
  Poets adapted some fables for amusement, and others to the nature of
  things, while a few were adapted to the character of men.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Delectandi causa fictas, ut eas quas volgo dicunt, vel quales Plautus et
Terentius composuerunt.
-->
  Plautus and Terentius composed these sort of fictions,
  as they generally called them, for amusement's sake.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Ad naturam rerum fabulas fingunt, ut "Vulcanus claudus," quia per naturam
numquam rectus est ignis; ut illa triformis bestia "prima leo, postrema
draco, media ipsa chimaera"; id est caprea, aetates hominum per eam volentes
distinguere; quarum ferox et horrens prima adulescentia, ut leo; dimidium
vitae tempus lucidissimum, ut caprea, eo quod acutissime videat; tunc fit
senectus casibus inflexis, draco.
-->
  They adapted fables to the nature of things, like "Lame Vulcan",
  since fire was never ruled by means of nature; like that threefold beast,
  "a lion in front, a snake behind, and the very middle a chimera";
  that is, a she-goat,
  the ages of man purposefully distinguishing themselves through it;
  of which youth is the wild and rough first part, like the lion; middle age
  is very bright, like the goat, because it sees so clearly;
  then comes old age with its bending calamities, like the snake.
