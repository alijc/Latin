<!--De Fabula-->
<h4>About the Fable</h4>

<p>
<!--
Fabulas poetae a fando nominaverunt, 
quia non sunt res factae, sed tantum loquendo fictae.
-->
  Poets have named fables, from "what is to be spoken",
  because they are not matters of fact, but only fictions to be spoken.

<!--
Quae ideo sunt inductae ut fictorum mutorum animalium inter se conloquio
imago quaedam vitae hominum nosceretur.
-->
  For that reason these are introduced so that, by means of fictional dumb
  animals speaking among themselves, the likeness of a certain mode of life of
  men might be recognized.

<!--
Has primus invenisse traditur Alcmaeon Crotoniensis, appellanturque Aesopiae,
quia is apud Phrygas in hac re polluit.
-->
  It is related that Alcmaeon of Croton first invented these,
  and they are called Aesopic, for he defiled at Phrygia in this matter.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Sunt autem fabulae aut Aesopicae aut Lybisticae.
-->
But fables are either Aesopic or Lybistic.

<!--
Aesopicae sunt cum animalia muta inter se sermocinasse finguntur, vel quae
animam non habent, ut urbes, arbores, montes, petrae, flumina.
-->
  The Aesopica are when dumb animals are contrived to converse among
  themselves, or things that don't have an soul, like cities, trees, mountains,
  rocks, or rivers. 

<!--
Lybisticae autem, dum hominum cum bestiis aut bestiarum cum hominibus
fingitur vocis esse commercium.
-->
  But the Lybistica are when the spoken fellowship of men with beasts or of
  beasts with men is contrived.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Fabulas poetae quasdam delectandi causa finxerunt, quasdam ad naturam
rerum, nonnullas ad mores hominum interpretati sunt.
-->
  Poets adapted some fables for amusement, and others to the nature of
  things, while a few were adapted to the character of men.

<!--
Delectandi causa fictas, ut eas quas volgo dicunt, vel quales Plautus et
Terentius composuerunt.
-->
  Plautus and Terentius composed these sort of fictions,
  as they generally called them, for amusement's sake.

<!--
Ad naturam rerum fabulas fingunt, ut "Vulcanus claudus," quia per naturam
numquam rectus est ignis; ut illa triformis bestia "prima leo, postrema
draco, media ipsa chimaera"; id est caprea, aetates hominum per eam volentes
distinguere; quarum ferox et horrens prima adulescentia, ut leo; dimidium
vitae tempus lucidissimum, ut caprea, eo quod acutissime videat; tunc fit
senectus casibus inflexis, draco.
-->
  They adapted fables to the nature of things, like "Lame Vulcan",
  since fire was never ruled by means of nature; like that threefold beast,
  "a lion in front, a snake behind, and the very middle a chimera";
  that is, a she-goat,
  wishing to distinguish the ages of man through it;
  of which youth is the wild and rough first part, like the lion;
  middle age is very bright, like the goat, because it sees so clearly;
  then comes old age with its crooked calamities, like the snake.

<!--
Sic et Hippocentauri fabulam esse confictam, id est hominem equo mixtum, ad
exprimendam, humanae vitae velocitatem, quia equum constat esse velocissimum.
-->
  Thus also was fashioned the fable of the Centaur,
  that is a man mixed with a horse, to portray the swiftness of human life,
  since everyone knows that a horse is very fast.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Ad mores, ut apud Horatium mus loquitur muri et mustela vulpeculae,
ut per narrationem fictam ad id quod agitur verax significatio
referatur.
-->
  And in regard to morals, as Horace has a mouse speaking to a mouse and a
  weasel to a fox, so that by means of a fictional tale the real significance 
  might be brought home about what goes on.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Unde Aesopi tales sunt fabulae ad morum finem relatae, vel sicut in
libro Iudicum ligna sibi    regem requirunt et loquuntur ad oleam et
ad ficum et ad vitem et ad rubum; quod
totum utique ad mores fingitur ut ad rem quae intenditur, ficta quidem
narratione sed veraci significatione, veniatur.
-->
Hence, such fables of Aesop were related for the goal of morals,
as in the book of Judges the trees ask for a king for themselves
and speak to the olive tree and to the fig tree and the the grape vine and
to the bramble; which was invented entirely for morals as it was its
intention. Indeed, it might be brought home through a fictional narrative
but with a truthful significance.

<!--
Sic et Demosthenes orator fabulam usus est adversus Philippum, qui
cum ab Atheniensibus postularet ut sibi decem oratores darentur et
discederet, finxit ille fabulam qua dissuaderet, dicens lupos
aliquando pastoribus, quorum diligentiam decipere voluissent, suasisse
ut in amicitiam convenirent, ea tamen condicione, ut si canes, in
quibus erat causa iurgiorum, iure illis traderentur; adnuisse pastores
et in spem securitatis dedisse canes, quos ovium suarum
vigilantissimos custodes habebant.
-->
  Thus also the orator Demosthenes made use of a fable against Phillip
  when he demanded that ten orators from Athens be given to him
  so that he'd go away.  He invented this fable to advise against it,
  telling how the wolves once wished to elude the diligence of the shepherds,
  and urged them to enter into a bond of friendship,
  but on the condition that their dogs, the reason for their disputes,
  be surrendered to them by law.
  That the shepherds agreed and gave away their dogs,
  who held the most vigilant watch over their sheep, in hope of safety.

<!--
Tunc lupi, adempta omni formidine, omne quod in gregibus illis
erat, non pro satietate tantum, verum etiam pro libidine laceraverunt.
-->
  Then the wolves, having gotten rid of all that they feared among those flocks,
  cut them to pieces, not so much to fill their stomachs as out of pure wantonness.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Philippum quoque principes populi postulare quo facilius possit
opprimere spoliatam custodibus urbem.
-->
  Likewise, Phillip was asking the leaders of the people for
  what would allow him to more easily oppress the city,
  once it was stripped of its guardians.
