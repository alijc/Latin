<!--DE DIEBUS ET NOCTE-->
<h4>On Days and on Night</h4>

<p>
<!--
De diebus.
-->
On days.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Dies est praesentia solis, sive sol supra terras, sicut nox sol sub terris.
-->
Day is the presence of the sun, or when the sun is above the earth, just as
night is when the sun is below the earth.

<!--
Ut enim dies aut nox sit, causa est aut supra terram sol, aut sub terris.
-->
  For in order for it to be day or night,
  the cause is that the sun is either above the earth, or below the earth.

<!--
Dies legitimus viginti quattuor horarum, usque dum dies et nox spatia sui cursus
ab oriente usque ad alium orientalem solem caeli volubilitate concludat.
-->
  A proper day is made up of twenty-four hours,
  the time it takes for a day and a night to complete
  the circuit of its course in a circular motion
  from the east until the next eastern sun in the sky.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Abusive autem dies unus spatium ab oriente sole usque ad occidentem.
-->
Now it's wrong to call the sun's circuit from east to west a single day.

<!--
Sunt autem diei spatia duo, interdianum atque nocturnum; et est dies quidem
horarum viginti quattuor, spatium autem horarum duodecim.
-->
  But there are two intervals of the day, diurnal and nocturnal;
  and a day really consists of twenty-four hours,
  but an interval of twelve hours.

<!--
Vocatus autem dies a parte meliore.
-->
But it's called a day from its more useful part.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Unde et in usu est ut sine commemoratione noctis numerum dicamus dierum,
sicut et in lege divina scriptum est: "Factum est vespere et mane dies unus."
-->
  From this too, it's common to speak of a number of days without mentioning
  nights, just as it was also written in the divine law:
  "There was made in the evening and the morning one day."

<!--
Dies secundum Aegyptios incohat ab occasu solis; secundum Persas ab ortu
solis; secundum Athenienses a sexta hora diei; secundum Romanos a media
nocte.
-->
  According to the Egyptians the day begins at sundown;
  according to the Persians, at sunrise;
  according to the Athenians, at the sixth hour of the day;
  according to the Romans, in the middle of the night.

<!--
Unde et tunc gallicinium est, quorum vox diei ostendit praeconium, quando et
mesonyctios afflatus fit.
-->
  From that time also comes the crow of the cock, whose voice proclaims the day,
  when the midnight breeze arises.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Dies dicti a diis, quorum nomina Romani quibusdam sideribus sacraverunt.
-->
'Day' ('dies') comes from 'gods' ('diis'), whose names the Romans consecrated to
  certain stars.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Primum enim diem a Sole appellaverunt, qui princeps est omnium
siderum, sicut et idem dies caput est cunctorum dierum.
-->
  For they named the first day after the Sun,
  which is the foremost of all the stars,
  just as that day is also the leader of all the days.

<!--
Secundum a Luna, quae Soli et splendore et magnitudine proxima est,
et ex eo mutuat lumen.
-->
  The second after the Moon,
  which is closest to the Sun in both brilliance and size,
  and which borrows its light from it.

<!--
Tertium ab stella Martis, quae Vesper vocatur.
-->
The third after the star of Mars, which is called the evening star.

<!--
Quartum ab stella Mercurii, quam quidem candidum circulum dicunt.
-->
The fourth after the star of Mercury, which some call a bright circle.

<!--
Quintum ab stella Iovis, quam Phaethontem aiunt.
-->
The fifth after the star of Jupiter, which they say is Phaethon.

<!--
Sextum a Veneris stella, quam Luciferum asserunt, quae inter omnia
sidera plus lucis habet.
-->
  The sixth after the star of Venus, which they say is the morning star,
  which among all the stars has the most light.

<!--
Septimus ab stella Saturni, quae sexto caelo locata, triginta annis
fertur explere cursum suum.
-->
  The seventh after the star of Saturn, which is set in the sixth heaven,
  and takes thirty years to complete its orbit.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Proinde autem ex his septem stellis nomina dierum gentiles dederunt
eo quod per eosdem aliquid sibi effici existimarent, dicentes habere a
Sole spiritum,
a luna corpus, a Mercurio ingenium et linguam, a Venere voluptatem, a
Marte sanguinem, a Iove temperantiam, a Saturno humorem.
-->
  But from these seven stars the heathens in the same way
  gave the names of the days by whatever they thought they caused in themselves,
  saying that they got their soul from the Sun,
  their body from the Moon, character and language from Mercury,
  pleasure from Venus, blood from Mars, self control from Jupiter,
  and fluids from Saturn.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Talis quippe extitit gentilium stultitia, qui sibi finxerunt tam
ridiculosa figmenta.
-->
  Of course, this really shows the stupidity of the heathens,
  who invented such ridiculous fictions for themselves.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Apud Hebraeos autem dies prima una sabbati dicitur, qui apud nos dies
dominicus est, quem gentiles Soli dicaverunt.
-->
  But among the Jews day after the sabbath is called the the first,
  which is the Lord's day among us, which the heathens called Sun-day.

<!--
Secunda sabbati secunda feria, quem saeculares diem Lunae vocant.
-->
  Following the sabbath comes the second day of the week,
  which the gentiles call Moon-day.

<!--
Tertia sabbati tertia feria, quem diem illi Martis vocant.
-->
The fourth day of the week, which they call Mars-day.

<!--
Quarta sabbati quarta feria, qui Mercurii dies dicitur a paganis.
-->
The fourth day of the week, which is called Mercury's day by the pagans.

<!--
Quinta sabbati quinta feria est, id est, quintus a die dominico, qui apud
gentiles Iovis vocatur.
-->
  The fifth day of the week, that is, the fifth after the day of the Lord,
  is what among the heathens is called Jupiter's day.

<!--
Sexta sabbati sexta feria dicitur, qui apud eosdem paganos Veneris
nuncupatur.
-->
  The sixth day after the sabbath is called the sixth day of the week,
  which among the same pagans is named for Venus. 

<!--
Sabbatum autem septimus a dominico dies est, quem gentiles Saturno
dicaverunt et Saturni nominaverunt.
-->
  But the sabbath is the seventh after the lord's day,
  which the heathens dedicated to Saturn and called Saturn's-day.

<!--
Sabbatum autem ex Hebraeo in Latinum requies interpretatur eo quod Deus
in eo requievisset ab omnibus operibus suis.
-->
  But the sabbath is translated from Hebrew into Latin as 'rest',
  because God had rested from all his works on that day.

<p>AJC
<!--
Partes diei tres sunt: mane, meridies et suprema.
-->
There are three parts of the day: morning, midday and evening.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Mane lux matura et plena, nec iam crepusculum.
-->
In the morning the light is ripe and full, and no longer dusk.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Et dictum mane a mano; manum enim antiqui bonum dicebant.
-->
  And the term 'morning' ('mane') comes from 'I spring' ('mano');
  for the ancients called the hand good.
</p>

<p>A
<!--
Quid enim melius luce?
-->
For what is better than light?
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Alii mane aestimant vocari a Manibus, quorum conversatio a luna ad
terram est.
-->
  Others consider that morning is named from Shades ('Manis'),
  who haunt from the moon to earth.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Alii putant ab aere, quia manus, id est rarus, est atque perspicuus.
-->
  Others think it's from the air, because a hand,
  that is rarefied, is also transparent.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Meridies dicta quasi medidies, hoc est medius dies; vel quia tunc purior
dies est.
-->
  Midday ('meridies') sounds like midday ('medidies'),
  which is the middle of the day;
  or because at that time the day is purer.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Merum enim purum dicitur.
-->
For unwatered wine is said to be pure.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
In toto enim die nihil clarius meridie, quando sol de medio caelo rutilat
et omnem orbem pari claritate inlustrat.
-->
  For in the whole day nothing is clearer than midday,
  when the sun glows red from the middle of the sky
  and lights up the whole world with equal clarity.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Suprema est postrema pars diei, quando sol cursum suum in occasum vertit;
dicta quod superest ad partem ultimam diei.
-->
  Evening ('suprema') is the last part of the day,
  when the sun turns its course to sink;
  so-called because it is left over ('superest') to the last part of the day.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Serum vocatum a clausis seris, quando iam nox venit, ut unusquisque somno
tutior sit.
-->
  'Late' ('serum') gets its name from a barred door ('clausa sera'),
  when night has already come, so that everyone might be safer in their sleep.
