AJC
<!--DE DIEBUS ET NOCTE-->
<h4>On Days and on Night</h4>

<p>AJC
<!--
De diebus.
-->
On days.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Dies est praesentia solis, sive sol supra terras, sicut nox sol sub terris.
-->
Day is the presence of the sun, or when the sun is above the earth, just as
night is when the sun is below the earth.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Ut enim dies aut nox sit, causa est aut supra terram sol, aut sub terris.
-->
  For in order for it to be day or night,
  the cause is that the sun is either above the earth, or below the earth.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Dies legitimus viginti quattuor horarum, usque dum dies et nox spatia sui cursus
ab oriente usque ad alium orientalem solem caeli volubilitate concludat.
-->
  A proper day is made up of twenty-four hours,
  the time it takes for a day and a night to complete
  the circuit of its course in a circular motion
  from the east until the next eastern sun in the sky.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Abusive autem dies unus spatium ab oriente sole usque ad occidentem.
-->
Now it's wrong to call the sun's circuit from east to west a single day.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Sunt autem diei spatia duo, interdianum atque nocturnum; et est dies quidem
horarum viginti quattuor, spatium autem horarum duodecim.
-->
  But there are two intervals of the day, diurnal and nocturnal;
  and a day really consists of twenty-four hours,
  but an interval of twelve hours.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Vocatus autem dies a parte meliore.
-->
But it's called a day from its more useful part.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Unde et in usu est ut sine commemoratione noctis numerum dicamus dierum,
sicut et in lege divina scriptum est: "Factum est vespere et mane dies unus."
-->
  From this too, it's common to speak of a number of days without mentioning
  nights, just as it was also written in the divine law:
  "There was made in the evening and the morning one day."
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Dies secundum Aegyptios incohat ab occasu solis; secundum Persas ab ortu
solis; secundum Athenienses a sexta hora diei; secundum Romanos a media
nocte.
-->
  According to the Egyptians the day begins at sundown;
  according to the Persians, at sunrise;
  according to the Athenians, at the sixth hour of the day;
  according to the Romans, in the middle of the night.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Unde et tunc gallicinium est, quorum vox diei ostendit praeconium, quando et
mesonyctios afflatus fit.
-->
  From that time also comes the crow of the cock, whose voice proclaims the day,
  when the midnight breeze might also be.
</p>
