<h4>THE FOUNDING OF BOBBIO</h4>

<p>
<!--
Beatus ergo Columbanus cum vidisset, ut superius diximus, devictum a
Theuderico Theudebertum, relicta Gallia atque Germania, Italiam ingreditur,
ubi ab Agilulfo Langobardorum rege honorifice receptus est.
-->
Therefore, as we have said before, after Saint Columbanus saw that
Theudebertus was defeated by Theudeberis, he left Gaul and Germany and
came to Italy, where he was honorably received by Agilulfus,
the king of the Lombards. 

<!--
Qui, largita optione, ut intra Italiam quocumque in loco voluisset
habitaret, ibi Dei consultu actum est, dum ille penes Mediolanium
urbem moraretur et haereseorum fraudes, id est, Arrianae  perfidiae,
scripturarum cauterio discerpi ac desecari vellet, contra quos etiam libellum
florenti scientia edidit, vir quidam nomine Iocundus ad
regem venit, qui regi indicat se in solitudine ruribus Appenninis basilicam
beati Petri apostolorum principis scire, in qua virtutes expertus sit fieri,
loca ubertate fecunda, aquis inrigua, piscium copia.
-->
  And when he was given the choice of living anywhere in Italy
  that he wished, there by God's will it came to pass,
  while he was staying at the city of Milan and was determined that the
  crimes of heresy, that is, Arian falsehoods,
  be burnt, torn up and cut out of the scriptures
  (he even published a book, with flowery language, against these),
  a certain man, Iocundus (Pleasant) by name, came to the king,
  and declared to him that he had knowledge of
  a church of Saint Peter, the first of the apostles,
  in the wilderness in the Appennine countryside,
  in which he might put his virtues to the test,
  places fruitful with abundance, running waters, plenty of fish.

Quem locum veterum traditio Bobium nuncupabant ob rivum in eo loco hoc
nomine fluentem amnemque alium profluentem nomine Triveam; super quem
olim Hannibal hiemans, hominum, equorum, elephantorum atrocissima damna
sensit.
-->
  And by tradition they called this ancient place Bobbio,
  from the name of the stream that flows in that place
  and another river flowing forth, called Trivea;
  upon which Hannibal once wintered, and experienced most terrible losses,
  of men, of horses, and of elephants.

<!--
Ubi cum venisset, omni cum intentione basilicam inibi semirutam reperiens,
prisco decori renovans reddidit.
-->
  And after he got there, he returned, with every intention
  of obtaining the half-ruined church in that place and restoring it to its
  former glory.

<!--
In cuius restauratione mira Domini virtus panditur.
-->
And in this restoration the wonderful power of the Lord was revealed.

Nam cum per praerupta saxorum scopula trabes ex abietibus inter densa
saltus locis inaccessibilibus caederentur, vel alibi caesa, inibi casu elapsa
aspero, aditum plaustrorum denegabant, mirum in modum
trabem, quem vix triginta vel quadraginta plano terrae solo positum vehere non
valerent, ibi cum duobus vel tribus, prout ardui callis    meatus patiebatur,
vir Dei accedens, suis ac suorum humeris immane pondus imponebat; et ubi
antea prae asperitate itineris libero gressu vix graderentur, onerati mox
trabium pondere festini gradiebantur, ut
versa vice, qui onera ferrent, acsi ab aliis veherentur, firmis vestigiis
velut otio vagantes, ovantes irent.
-->
  For when through steep brooms of rocks fir trees were chopped down
  in the middle of thick, inaccessible woodlands,
  or cut down elsewhere, and by chance felled into rough places
  that wagons couldn't approach,
  in a wondrous manner the trunk,
  which thirty or forty men could barely suceed in carrying on level ground,
  there with just two or three, on a course afflicted with steep, rocky paths,
  the man of God, climbing up, laid a heavy weight on his shoulders and on those
  of his men;
  and where before this, in view of the roughness of the road,
  they could barely walk with unconstrained steps,
  now, burdened with the weight of the trunks they were walking swiftly,
  so that, turn and turn about, they bore their burdens with steady steps,
  as if they were carried by other men,
  just like those wandering at their leisure, they went rejoicing.

Videns itaque vir Dei tanti auxilii supplementum, suos hortatur ut arreptum
opus laeti perficiant, animoque roborati, eo consistere in heremo studeant;
Dei in hoc voluntatis esse adfirmat.
-->
  And so the man of God seeing the supplement of such aid,
  he encouraged his men to finish the work that they'd started with cheer,
  and with strong hearts, and to strive to stand together with him in the
  wilderness; he affirms that it is God's will in this.

Tecta itaque templi culmina, murorum restaurat ruinas, ceteraque quaeque ad
monasterii necessitatem pertinent, construere parat.
-->
  And so he restores the church's roof, and the ruins of its walls,
  and prepares to build anything else that pertains
  to the needs of a monastery.

Porro beatus Columbanus, expleto anni circulo, in antedicto coenobio
Ebobiensi vita beata functus, animam membris solutam caelo reddidit VIIII Kl.
Decembris.
-->
  At length the blessed Columbanus, having fullfilled his circle of years in
  the aforesaid monastery of Ebobiensus, after observing a blessed life,
  restored his soul, released from its limbs,
  to heaven on 9 Calends of December.

Reliquiaeque eius eo habentur in loco conditae, ubi et virtutum
decore pollent praesule Christo, cui est gloria per omnia saecula
saeculorum.  Amen.

  And his relics are kept safe in this place,
  where even of mighty works they are properly powerful with our patron
  Christ, to whom is glory through all the ages of the world.  Amen.
