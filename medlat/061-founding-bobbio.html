<h4>THE FOUNDING OF BOBBIO</h4>
-->

<p>
<!--
Beatus ergo Columbanus cum vidisset, ut superius diximus, devictum a
Theuderico Theudebertum, relicta Gallia atque Germania, Italiam ingreditur,
ubi ab Agilulfo Langobardorum rege honorifice receptus est.
-->
Therefore, as we have said before, after Saint Columbanus arrived,
Theudebertus, defeated by Theudeberis, after leaving Gaul and Germany,
came to Italy, where he was honorably received by Agilulfus,
the king of the Lombards.

Qui, largita optione, ut intra Italiam quocumque in loco voluisset
habitaret, ibi Dei consultu actum est, dum ille penes Mediolanium
urbem moraretur et haereseorum fraudes, id est, Arrianae  perfidiae,
scripturarum cauterio discerpi ac desecari vellet, contra quos etiam libellum
florenti scientia edidit, vir quidam nomine Iocundus ad
regem venit, qui regi indicat se in solitudine ruribus Appenninis basilicam
beati Petri apostolorum principis scire, in qua virtutes expertus sit fieri,
loca ubertate fecunda, aquis inrigua, piscium copia.
-->
  And he, when he was given the choice of living anywhere in Italy
  that he wished, there by God's will it came to pass,
  while he was staying at the city of Milan and determined that the
  crimes of heresy, that is, Arian falsehoods,
  be burnt, torn up and cut out of the scriptures
  (he even published a book, with flowery language, against these),
  a certain man, Iocundus (Pleasant) by name, came to the king,
  and showed him the church of Saint Peter of the apostles, the first to know,
  in the wilderness in the Appennine countryside,
  in which he might put his virtues to test,
  places fruitful with abundance, with running waters, plenty of fish.

Quem locum veterum traditio Bobium nuncupabant ob rivum in eo loco hoc
nomine fluentem amnemque alium profluentem nomine Triveam; super quem
olim Hannibal hiemans, hominum, equorum, elephantorum atrocissima damna
sensit.
-->
  And by tradition they called this ancient place Bobbio,
  from the name of the stream that flows in that place
  and another river flowing forth, called Trivea;
  upon which once Hannibal wintered, and experienced most terrible losses,
  of men, of horses, and of elephants.

<!--
Ubi cum venisset, omni cum intentione basilicam inibi semirutam reperiens,
prisco decori renovans reddidit.
-->
  And after he got there, he returned, with every intention
  of obtaining the half-ruined church in that place and restoring it to its
  former glory.

<!--
In cuius restauratione mira Domini virtus panditur.
-->
And in this restoration the wonderful power of the Lord was unfolded.
