<h4>HOW CHRISTIANITY CAME TO BRITAIN</h4>

<p>START</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Nec silentio praetereunda opinio quae de beato Gregorio traditione  maiorum
ad nos usque perlata est.
-->
  Nor should we pass over in silence the story which
  was carried down to us from the blessed Gregory
  in the tradition of our ancestors.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Dicunt quia die quadam cum, advenientibus nuper mercatoribus,
multa venalia in forum fuissent conlata, multi ad emendum confluxissent, et
ipsum Gregorium inter alios advenisse, ac vidisse inter alia pueros venales
positos candidi corporis ac venusti vultus, capillorum quoque
forma egregia.
-->
  They say that on a certain day when, as the traders had recently arrived,
  many things had been brought together for sale in the market
  and many people had assembled to buy, and
  Gregory himself came with the others,
  and saw, among other things for sale, boys set
  of radiant body and graceful mien, and of hair with extraordinary beauty.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quos cum adspiceret interrogavit, ut aiunt, de qua regione vel terra essent
adlati.
-->
  And as he gazed on them he asked, so they say, which region or land
  they had been brought from.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Dictumque est quia de Britannia insula, cuius incolae talis essent
aspectus.
-->
  And he was told that they were from the island of Britain,
  whose inhabitants were of such an appearance.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Rursus interrogavit utrum idem insulani christiani an paganis adhuc
erroribus essent implicati.
-->
  Again he asked whether these islanders were Christian,
  or were still entangled in pagan errors.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Dictum est quod essent pagani.
-->
  He was told that they were pagans.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
At ille, intimo ex corde longa trahens suspiria: "Heu, pro
dolor!" inquit, "quod tam lucidi vultus homines tenebrarum auctor possidet
tantaque gratia frontispicii mentem ab interna gratia vacuam gestat."
-->
  But he, drawing a sigh from his inmost heart, said, "Alas, what sorrow!
  that the author of darkness is master of men of such clear faces
  and that so fair an outside carries a mind free of inward grace."
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Rursus ergo interrogavit quod esset vocabulum gentis illius.
-->
  And so he asked once more what the name of that tribe was.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Responsum est quod Angli vocarentur.
-->
  The answer was that they were called Angles.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
At ille: "Bene," inquit, "nam et angelicam habent faciem et tales angelorum
in caelis decet esse cohaeredes.
-->
  But he said, "Good, for they even have angelic faces and
  it is fitting for such men to be co-heirs of angels in heaven.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quod habet nomen ipsa provincia, de qua isti sunt adlati?"
-->
  What name has that province, from which these were brought?"
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Responsum est quod Deiri vocarentur idem provinciales.
-->
  The answer was that the province was called Deiri.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
At ille: "Bene," inquit, "Deiri; de ira eruti, et ad misericordiam Christi
vocati.
-->
  But he said, "Good, Deiri; from wrath they were uprooted,
  and were called to the mercy of Christ.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Rex provinciae illius quomodo appellatur?"
-->
  How is the king of that province called?"
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Responsum est quod Aelli diceretur.
-->
  The answer was that he is called Aelli.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
At ille adludens ad nomen ait: "Alleluia, laudem Dei creatoris illis in
partibus oportet cantari."
-->
  But he, making a play on the name, said:
  "Alleluia, it is meet that the praise of God the creator be sung in those
  parts."
</p>
