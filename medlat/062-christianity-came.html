<h4>HOW CHRISTIANITY CAME TO BRITAIN</h4>

<p>
<!--
Nec silentio praetereunda opinio quae de beato Gregorio traditione  maiorum
ad nos usque perlata est.
-->
  Nor should we pass over in silence the story about the blessed Gregory
  which was carried down to us in the tradition of our ancestors.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Dicunt quia die quadam cum, advenientibus nuper mercatoribus,
multa venalia in forum fuissent conlata, multi ad emendum confluxissent, et
ipsum Gregorium inter alios advenisse, ac vidisse inter alia pueros venales
positos candidi corporis ac venusti vultus, capillorum quoque
forma egregia.
-->
  They say that on a certain day when, as the traders had recently arrived,
  many things had been brought together for sale in the market
  and many people had assembled to buy them, and
  Gregory himself came with the others,
  and saw, among other things set for sale, boys
  of radiant body and graceful mien, and with extraordinary beauty of hair.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quos cum adspiceret interrogavit, ut aiunt, de qua regione vel terra essent
adlati.
-->
  And as he gazed on them he asked, so they say, which region or land
  they had been brought from.

<!--
Dictumque est quia de Britannia insula, cuius incolae talis essent
aspectus.
-->
  And he was told that they were from the island of Britain,
  whose inhabitants were of such an appearance.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Rursus interrogavit utrum idem insulani christiani an paganis adhuc
erroribus essent implicati.
-->
  He asked in turn whether these islanders were Christian,
  or were still entangled in pagan errors.

<!--
Dictum est quod essent pagani.
-->
  He was told that they were pagans.

<!--
At ille, intimo ex corde longa trahens suspiria: "Heu, pro
dolor!" inquit, "quod tam lucidi vultus homines tenebrarum auctor possidet
tantaque gratia frontispicii mentem ab interna gratia vacuam gestat."
-->
  But he, drawing a sigh from his inmost heart, said, "Alas, what sorrow!
  that the author of darkness is master of men of such clear faces
  and that so fair an outside carries a mind free of inward grace."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Rursus ergo interrogavit quod esset vocabulum gentis illius.
-->
  And so he asked once more what the name of that tribe was.

<!--
Responsum est quod Angli vocarentur.
-->
  The answer was that they were called Angles.

<!--
At ille: "Bene," inquit, "nam et angelicam habent faciem et tales angelorum
in caelis decet esse cohaeredes.
-->
  But he said, "Good, for they even have angelic faces and
  it is fitting for such men to be co-heirs of angels in heaven.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quod habet nomen ipsa provincia, de qua isti sunt adlati?"
-->
  What is the name of that province that these were brought from?"

<!--
Responsum est quod Deiri vocarentur idem provinciales.
-->
  The answer was that the people of that province were called Deiri.

<!--
At ille: "Bene," inquit, "Deiri; de ira eruti, et ad misericordiam Christi
vocati.
-->
  But he said, "Good, Deiri; they have been uprooted from wrath
  and called to the mercy of Christ.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Rex provinciae illius quomodo appellatur?"
-->
  What is the king of that province called?"

<!--
Responsum est quod Aelli diceretur.
-->
  The answer was that he was called Aelli.

<!--
At ille adludens ad nomen ait: "Alleluia, laudem Dei creatoris illis in
partibus oportet cantari."
-->
  But he, making a play on the name, said:
  "Alleluia, it is meet that the praise of God the creator be sung in those
  parts."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Accedensque ad pontificem Romanae et apostolicae sedis (nondum enim erat
ipse pontifex factus) rogavit ut genti Anglorum in Britanniam aliquos verbi
ministros, per quos ad Christum converteretur, mitteret; se ipsum paratum
esse in hoc opus, Domino cooperante, perficiendum, si tamen apostolico papae
hoc ut fieret placeret.
-->
  And he went up to the pontif of Rome and of the apostolic see
  (for he himself hadn't yet become pontif) and asked him to send
  some ministers of the word to the tribe of the Angles in Britain,
  to convert them to Christ;
  he himself was ready to accomplish this task, with the Lord's help,
  if it yet pleased the apostolic pope for this to happen.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quod dum perficere non posset, quia, etsi pontifex concedere illi quod
petierat voluit, non tamen cives Romani ut tam longe ab urbe secederet
potuere permittere; mox, ut ipse pontificatus officio functus est,
perfecit opus diu desideratum; alios quidem praedicatores mittens, sed ipse
praedicationem ut fructificaret suis exhortationibus ac precibus adiuvans.
-->
  And while he was not able to complete this, for,
  although the pontif wished to allow him what he had asked,
  the citizens of Rome didn't let him leave the city for a long time;
  then, while he himself was performing the office of the pontificate,
  he accomplished the task that long had been desired;
  indeed sending other preachers, but with he himself aiding
  the preaching with his encouragements and
  prayers so that it would bear fruit.
