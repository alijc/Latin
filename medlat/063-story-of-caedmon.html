<h4>THE STORY OF CAEDMON</h4>

<p>
<!--
In huius monasterio abbatissae fuit frater quidam divina gratia
specialiter insignis, quia carmina religioni et pietati apta facere
solebat; ita ut, quicquid ex divinis litteris per interpretes disceret,
hoc ipse post pusillum verbis poeticis maxima suavitate et compunctione
compositis, in sua, id est Anglorum, lingua proferret.
-->
  In this abbess' monastery there was a certain brother especially noted with
  divine grace, because he used to make songs suited to worship and piety;
  so that, whatever he learned from sacred literature through translators,
  he would, after a short time, composing poetic words with the greatest
  sweetness and humility, bring it forth in his own tongue, that is,
  that of the Angles.

<!--
Cuius carminibus multorum saepe animi ad contemptum saeculi et
appetitum sunt vitae caelestis accensi.
-->
  And through his songs the souls of many often were kindled
  to a contempt for worldly things and a desire for a heavenly life.

<!--
Et quidem et alii post illum in gente Anglorum religiosa poemata
facere temptabant; sed nullus eum aequiperare potuit.
-->
  And indeed, there were others after him among the tribe of the Angles who
  also attempted to write religious poems; but not one was able to equal him.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Namque ipse non ab hominibus neque per hominem institutus canendi
artem didicit, sed divinitus adiutus gratis canendi donum accepit.
-->
  For indeed he didn't learn the art of singing from men,
  nor had he been instructed by a man,
  but received the gift for singing naturally, with divine aid. 

<!--
Unde nil umquam frivoli et supervacui poematis facere potuit, sed ea
tantummodo quae ad religionem pertinent, religiosam eius linguam decebant.
-->
  For this reason he could not compose any frivolous or pointless poem,
  but only those that pertained to worship,
  and were proper for his devout tongue.

<!--
Siquidem in habitu saeculari usque ad tempora provectioris aetatis
constitutus, nil carminum aliquando didicerat.
-->
  Indeed, since he'd lived in a worldly fashion up until old age,
  he'd not learned anything of songs at any time.

<!--
Unde nonnumquam in convivio, cum esset laetitiae causa decretum ut
omnes per ordinem cantare deberent, ille, ubi appropinquare sibi
citharam cernebat, surgebat a media cena et egressus ad suam domum
repedabat.
-->
  Because of this, sometimes during a dinner party,
  when it was decided that everyone should take a turn at singing
  for the joy of it, when he realized that the lyre was approaching him, he
  would get up in the middle of dinner, and leave and retire to his house.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quod dum tempore quodam faceret, et relicta domu convivii egressus
esset ad stabula iumentorum, quorum ei custodia nocte illa erat delegata,
ibique hora competenti membra dedisset sopori, adstitit ei quidam per
somnium, eumque salutans ac suo appellans nomine: "Caedmon," inquit,
"canta mihi aliquid."
-->
  And on one occassion when he did that, after leaving the dining hall
  he went out to the horses' stable, that he had been assigned to safe-guard
  that night, and there at the proper hour had given his limbs to slumber,
  someone appeared to him in a dream, and greeting him and calling him by name,
  "Caedmon", he said, "sing something for me."
</p>

<p>
<!--
At ille respondens: "Nescio," inquit, "cantare; nam et ideo de
convivio egressus huc secessi quia cantare non poteram."
-->
  But he replied, saying: "I don't know how to sing: for that reason
  I even left the feast and withdrew to here, becuase I cannot sing."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Rursum ille qui cum eo loquebatur, "Attamen," ait, "mihi cantare
habes."
-->
  The one who was speaking with him said in turn,
  "Nevertheless, you have to sing to me."
</p>

<p>
<!--
"Quid," inquit, "debeo cantare?"
-->
  "What", he said, "should I sing?"
</p>

<p>
<!--
Et ille: "Canta," inquit, "principium creaturarum."
-->
  And he said: "Sing of the beginning of creation."
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quo accepto responso, statim ipse coepit cantare in laudem Dei
conditoris versus quos numquam audierat, quorum iste est sensus: "Nunc
laudare debemus auctorem regni caelestis, potentiam creatoris et
consilium illius, facta Patris gloriae.
-->
  When he heard this answer, he at once began to sing, in praise of God,
  verses of the creator that he had never heard, of which this is the sense:
  "Now we ought to praise the author of the kingdom of heaven, the power of
  the creator and his plan, done for the glory of the Father.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quomodo ille, cum sit aeternus Deus, omnium miraculorum auctor
exstitit, qui primo filiis hominum caelum pro culmine tecti, dehinc
terram custos humani generis omnipotens creavit."
-->
  In this way he, since he is eternal God,
  has stood out as the author of all miracles,
  who, the all-powerful guardian of humankind,
  first created heaven as a roof of shelter, and after that earth,
  for the children of men."
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Hic est sensus, non autem ordo ipse verborum, quae dormiens ille
canebat; neque enim possunt carmina, quamvis optime composita, ex alia
in aliam linguam ad verbum sine detrimento sui decoris ac dignitatis
transferri.
-->
  This is the sense, but not the actual order of the words that he sang
  in his sleep; for songs, however well composed, cannot be translated from
  one language into another verbatim without loss to their beauty and dignity.
