<h4>THE STORY OF CAEDMON</h4>

<!--
In huius monasterio abbatissae fuit frater quidam divina gratia
specialiter insignis, quia carmina religioni et pietati apta facere
solebat; ita ut, quicquid ex divinis litteris per interpretes disceret,
hoc ipse post pusillum verbis poeticis maxima suavitate et compunctione
compositis, in sua, id est Anglorum, lingua proferret.
-->
  In this abbess' monastery there was a certain brother especially noted with
  divine grace, because he used to make songs suited to worship and piety;
  so that, whatever he learned from sacred literature through translators,
  he would, after a short time, composing poetic words with the greatest
  sweetness and humility, bring it forth in his own tongue, that is,
  that of the Angles.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Cuius carminibus multorum saepe animi ad contemptum saeculi et
appetitum sunt vitae caelestis accensi.
-->
  And through his songs the souls of many often were kindled
  to a contempt for worldly things and a desire for a heavenly life.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Et quidem et alii post illum in gente Anglorum religiosa poemata
facere temptabant; sed nullus eum aequiperare potuit.
-->
  And indeed, there were others after him among the tribe of the Angles who
  also attempted to write religious poems; but not one was able to equal him.
