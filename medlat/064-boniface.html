<h4>Boniface Destroys the Oak of Thor</h4>

<!--
Cum vero Hessorum iam multi, catholica fide subditi ac septiformis
spiritus gratia confirmati, manus impositionem acceperunt, et alii
quidem, nondum animo confortati, intemeratae fidei documenta integre
percipere renuerunt; alii etiam lignis et fontibus clanculo, alii
autem aperte sacrificabant; alii vero haruspicia et divinationes,
praestigia atque incantationes occulte, alii quidem manifeste
exercebant, alii quippe auguria et auspicia intendebant diversosque
sacrificandi ritus incoluerunt; alii etiam, quibus mens sanior inerat,
omni abiecta gentilitatis profanatione, nihil horum commiserunt.
-->
  Indeed, while many of the Hessians had already submitted to the catholic faith
  and been confirmed by the grace of the sevenfold spirit
  and had accepted the laying on of hands,
  certain others, not yet very much strengthened in their hearts,
  refused to entirely learn the lessons of pure faith;
  yet others sacrificed to trees and springs, some secretly, but others openly;
  indeed, some praciticed soothsaying and divination,
  tricks and enchantments, some secretly, and others quite openly,
  naturally, others exercised auguries and omens and practiced
  different rites for sacrificing; still others, who had sounder intellects
  that were cast down by every profanity of paganism, trusted none of these.

Quorum consultu atque consilio roborem quendam mirae magnitudinis,
qui prisco paganorum vocabulo appellatur robur Iovis, in loco qui
dicitur Gaesmere, servis Dei secum adstantibus, succidere temptavit.
-->
  And following the advice and counsel of these men,
  he attempted to cut down an oak of remarkable size,
  which was called, in the old pagan nomenclature, the Oak of Thor,
  in the place called Gaesmere, with the servants of God standing with me.

Cumque, mentis constantia confortatus, arborem succidisset magna
quippe aderat copia paganorum, qui et inimicum deorum suorum intra se
diligentissime devotabant--sed ad modicum quidem arbore praeciso,
confestim immensa roboris moles, divino
desuper flatu exagitata, palmitum confracto culmine, corruit et quasi
superni nutus solacio in quattuor etiam partes disrupta est, et
quattuor ingentis magnitudinis aequali longitudine trunci absque
fratrum labore adstantium apparuerunt.
-->
  And after, strengthened by the firmness of his mind,
  he had made an undercut on the tree, a great number of pagans appeared,
  who among selves were both cursing the enemy of their gods most thoroughly
  - but indeed, at a short time after the tree was cut in front,
  at once the immense mass of oak fell, attacked by a divine wind from above,
  with the top of the branches shattered,
  and as if by the will of heaven was split to/by solace in four yet parts,
  and four trunks of enormous size in equal length appeared,
  without the labor of the brothers who were standing by.

<!--
Quo viso, prius devotantes pagani etiam versa vice benedictionem
Domino, pristina abiecta maledictione, credentes reddiderunt.
-->
  And when they saw this, the pagans who were cursing earlier now in turn
  abandoning their former abuse, believing, rendered blessings to the Lord.

<!--
Tunc autem summae sanctitatis antistes, consilio inito cum
fratribus, ligneum ex supradictae arboris metallo oratorium construxit
idque in honore sancti Petri apostoli dedicavit.
-->
  But then the prelate of the highest sanctity,
  having formed a plan with the brothers,
  the wood from the aforesaid tree to/by metal of orators constructed
  and dedicated it in honor of Saint Peter the apostle.
