Cum vero Hessorum iam multi, catholica fide subditi ac septiformis
spiritus gratia confirmati, manus impositionem acceperunt, et alii
quidem, nondum animo confortati, intemeratae fidei documenta integre
percipere renuerunt; alii etiam lignis et fontibus clanculo, alii
autem aperte sacrificabant; alii vero haruspicia et divinationes,
praestigia atque incantationes occulte, alii quidem manifeste
exercebant, alii quippe auguria et auspicia intendebant diversosque
sacrificandi ritus incoluerunt; alii etiam, quibus mens sanior inerat,
omni abiecta gentilitatis profanatione, nihil horum commiserunt.

  Indeed, while many of the Hessians had already submitted to the catholic faith
  and been confirmed by the grace of the sevenfold spirit
  and had accepted the laying on of hands,
  certain others, not yet very much strengthened in their hearts,
  refused to entirely learn the lessons of pure faith;
  yet others sacrificed to trees and springs, some secretly, but others openly;
  indeed, some praciticed soothsaying and divination,
  tricks and enchantments, some secretly, and others quite openly,
  naturally, others exercised auguries and omens and practiced
  different rites for sacrificing; still others, who had sounder intellects
  that were cast down by every profanity of paganism, trusted none of these.

Quorum consultu atque consilio roborem quendam mirae magnitudinis,
qui prisco paganorum vocabulo appellatur robur Iovis, in loco qui
dicitur Gaesmere, servis Dei secum adstantibus, succidere temptavit.
-->
  And following the advice and counsel of these men,
  he attempted to cut down an oak of remarkable size,
  which was called, in the old pagan nomenclature, the Oak of Thor,
  in the place called Gaesmere, with the servants of God standing with me.
