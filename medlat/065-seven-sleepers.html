<h4>The Seven Sleepers</h4>

<p>START</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Haut ab re esse arbitror paulisper narrandi ordinem postponere, 
et quia adhuc stilus in Germania vertitur, miraculum, 
quod illic apud omnes celebre habetur, seu et quaedam alia breviter intimare.
-->
  I by no means think that it is from the matter to postpone for a short while
  for relating the series,
  and since thus far a stylus is engaged in Germany, a miracle,
  because there it is frequently held with all men,
  and also to briefly recount certain other things.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
In extremis circium versus Germaniae finibus,
in ipso oceani litore antrum sub eminenti rupe conspicitur, 
ubi septem viri, incertum ex quo tempore, longo sopiti sopore quiescunt, 
ita inlaesis non solum corporibus sed etiam vestimentis, ut ex hoc ipso, 
quod sine ulla per tot annorum curricula corruptione perdurant, 
apud indociles easdem et barbaras nationes veneratione habeantur.
-->
  In the furthest northwest region of Germany,
  on the very ocean shore a cave can be seen under a towering cliff,
  where seven men drowse.
  They were put into a deep sleep God knows how long ago and are whole,
  in body but also in their garments, as from this very thing,
  because they have lasted through the course of so many years without decay,
  they are held in veneration by ignorant nations and also barbarians.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Hi denique, quantum ad habitum spectat, Romani esse cernuntur.
-->
  In the end, when one looks closely at their dress, these men
  are seen to be Romans.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
E quibus dum unum quidam cupiditate stimulatus vellet exuere, mox eius,
ut dicitur, bracchia aruerunt, poenaque sua ceteros perterruit, 
ne quis eos ulterius contingere auderet.
-->
  And if someone were greedy enough to try to undress one of these,
  it is said that his arms immediately wither,
  and his punishment terrifies the rest,
  so that none dare to touch them further.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Videres ad quod eos profectum per tot tempora providentia divina conservet.
-->
  Look at what an accomplishment divine providence has preserved through so many
  seasons. 
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Fortasse horum quandoque, quia non aliter nisi christiani esse putantur,
gentes illae praedicatione salvandae sunt.
-->
  Perhaps of these whenever, since not otherwise unless Christians to be they
  are believed,
  these Gentiles by proclamation about to be saved are.
