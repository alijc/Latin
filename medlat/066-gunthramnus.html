<h4>The Vision of Gunthramnus</h4>


<p>
<!--
Cuius unum factum satis admirabile libet nos huic nostrae historiae breviter inserere, praesertim cum hoc Francorum historia noverimus minime contineri. 
-->
  And one fact about him pleases us as remarkable enough to briefly insert into
  our account, especially since we know that it was very poorly preserved in the
  history of the Franks.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Is cum venatum quodam tempore in silvam isset, et ut adsolet fieri, 
hac illacque discurrentibus sociis, 
ipse cum uno fidelissimo tamen suo remansisset, gravissimo somno depressus,
caput in genibus eiusdem fidelis sui reclinans, obdormivit. 
-->
  Once when in hunting he entered a forest, and as usual,
  while his companions wandered about hither and yon,
  he himself was left with bit a single faithful retainer.
  He was weighed down by a deep slumber,
  and laying his head into his faithful man's lap, he fell asleep.

<!--
De cuius ore parvum animal, in modum reptilis egressum,
tenuem rivulum qui propter discurrebat ut transire possit satagere coepit. 
-->
  And a small animal, rather like a reptile, came out of his mouth and
  began to bustle about a small rivulet that flowed nearby, trying to cross it.

<!--
Tunc isdem in cuius gremio quiescebat spatham suam vagina exemptam super eundem rivulum posuit; 
super quam illud reptile, de quo diximus, ad partem aliam transmeavit. 
-->
  Then that same man on whose lap he was resting drew his broadsword from its
  scabbard and placed it over that rivulet;
  and the reptile that we spoke about travelled across it to the other side.

<!--
Quod cum non longe exinde in quoddam foramen montis ingressum fuisset
et post aliquantum spatii regressum super eandem spatham praefatum rivulum transmeasset, 
rursum in os Gunthramni, de quo exierat, introivit. 
-->
  And after it had entered a certain nearby fissure in the
  mountain and returned some time later,
  it crossed over the rivulet on the aforementioned sword, and
  reentered Gunthramnus' mouth, from which it had issued before.

<p>START</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Gunthramnus post haec de somno expergefactus mirificam se visionem vidisse narravit.
-->
  After this Gunthramnus woke from his sleep and
  related that he'd had an amazing dream.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Retulit enim paruisse sibi in somnis quod fluvium quendam per pontem ferreum transisset et sub montem quoddam introisset ubi multum auri pondus aspexisset.
-->
  For he reported that it seemed to him that in his sleep
  he had crossed some river on an iron bridge and
  had entered into some mountain, where he'd seen a great weight of gold.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Is vero in cuius gremio caput tenuerat cum dormisset, quid de eo viderat ei per ordinem retulit.
-->
  And then the man who had held his head in his lap while he slept,
  reported to him what he'd seen in what order.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quid plura?
-->
  What more?
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Effossus est locus ille, et inaestimabiles thesauri, qui ibidem antiquitus positi fuerant, sunt reperti.
-->
  That spot was dug up and priceless treasures were discovered,
  that had long ago been deposited in that very place.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
De quo auro ipse rex postmodum cyborium solidum mirae magnitudinis et magni ponderis fecit, multisque illud preciosissimis gemmis decoratum ad sepulchrum Domini Hierosolimam transmittere voluit.
-->
  And from that gold the king himself afterwards made a solid cube
  of a wonderful size and a great weight, and with many most precious gems
  that he wanted to send to Jerusalem to adorn the tomb of our Lord.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Sed cum minime potuisset, idem supra corpus beati Marcelli martyris, quod in civitate Cavalono sepultum est, ubi sedes regni illius erat, poni fecit; et est ibi usque in praesentem diem.
-->
  But after he hadn't been able to do this,
  he had it placed over the body of the blessed martyr Marcellus,
  who was buried in the city of Cavalonum, where that king's throne was;
  and it is there up to the present day.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Nec est usquam ullum opus ex auro effectum quod ei valeat comparari.
-->
  Nor is there anywhere any work made from gold that compares to it.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Sed nos, his breviter quae relatu digna erant contactis, ad historiam revertamur.
-->
  But after briefly touching on these things which were worth relating,
  we return to the history.
</p>

<p>END</p>
