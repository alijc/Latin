<h4>The Vision of Gunthramnus</h4>


<p>START</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Cuius unum factum satis admirabile libet nos huic nostrae historiae breviter inserere, praesertim cum hoc Francorum historia noverimus minime contineri. 
-->
  And one fact about him pleases us as remarkable enough to briefly insert into
  our account, especially since we know that it was very poorly preserved in the
  history of the Franks.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Is cum venatum quodam tempore in silvam isset, et ut adsolet fieri, 
hac illacque discurrentibus sociis, 
ipse cum uno fidelissimo tamen suo remansisset, gravissimo somno depressus,
caput in genibus eiusdem fidelis sui reclinans, obdormivit. 
-->
  Once when in hunting he entered a forest, and as usual,
  while his companions wandered about hither and yon,
  he himself stayed with a single faithful retainer.
  He was weighed down by a deep slumber,
  and laying his head into his faithful man's lap, he fell asleep.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
De cuius ore parvum animal, in modum reptilis egressum,
tenuem rivulum qui propter discurrebat ut transire possit satagere coepit. 
-->
  And a small animal, rather like a reptile, came out of his mouth and
  began to bustle about a small rivulet that flowed nearby, trying to cross it.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Tunc isdem in cuius gremio quiescebat spatham suam vagina exemptam super eundem rivulum posuit; 
super quam illud reptile, de quo diximus, ad partem aliam transmeavit. 
-->
  Then that same man whose lap he was resting drew his broadsword from its
  scabbard and placed it over that rivulet;
  and that reptile, about which we spoke, travelled across it to the other side.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quod cum non longe exinde in quoddam foramen montis ingressum fuisset
et post aliquantum spatii regressum super eandem spatham praefatum rivulum transmeasset, 
rursum in os Gunthramni, de quo exierat, introivit. 
-->
  And a little while later, after it had entered a certain fissure in the
  mountain and returned after some time,
  it crossed over the rivulet on the aforementioned sword, and
  reentered Gunthramnus' mouth, from which it had issued before.
