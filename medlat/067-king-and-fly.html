<h4>The King and the Fly</h4>

<p>
<!--
Rex vero Cunincpert dum post haec cum stratore suo, 
qui lingua propria marpahis dicitur,
consilium iniret in civitate Ticinensi quomodo Aldonem et Grausonem vita privare deberet, 
repente in fenestra iuxta quam consistebant una de maiusculis musca consedit;
quam Cunincpert cultello ut extingueret percutere volens, eius tantum pedem abscidit.
-->
  In fact, after this, while King Cunincpert was hatching a plot with his master
  of horse (who in their own language is called "marpahis") in the city of
  Ticinum, of how they might deprive Aldo and Grauso of their lives,
  suddenly one of the larger flies alighted in the window next to where they were standing.
  Cunincpert wished to strike it with a dagger, in order to kill it,
  but only cut its foot off.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Aldo vero et Grauso dum ad palatium regis consilium nescientes venirent,
cum basilicae sancti Romani martyris, quae prope palatium sita est, 
propinquassent, repente eis obvius quidam claudus uno pede truncato factus est;
qui eis dixit quod eos Cunincpert, si ad eum pergerent, occisurus esset.
-->
  And truly, when Aldo and Grauso, knowing nothing of the plot,
  came to the royal palace
  and had gotten close to the basilica of the holy Roman martyr,
  which is situated near the palace,
  suddenly their way was blocked by a certain man, lame in one maimed foot;
  who told them that if they went on to Cunincpert, he was going to kill them.

<!--
Qui haec audientes, magno timore correpti, post altarium eiusdem basilicae confugiere.
-->
  And when they heard this, they were seized with dread, and took refuse behind
  the altar of the same basilica.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Moxque Cunincperto regi nuntiatum est quod Aldo et Grauso in basilica beati
Romani martyris confugissent.
-->
  And it was soon reported to King Cunincpert that Aldo and Grauso had fled
  into the basilica of the holy Roman martyr.

<!--
Tunc Cunincpert stratorem suum arguere coepit ut quid suum consilium prodere debuisset.
-->
  Then Cunincpert began to upbraid his master of horse, asking why he'd had
  to reveal his plan.

<!--
Cui suus strator ita respondit: "Domine mi rex, tu scis quia postquam hoc consiliati sumus ego a tuo conspectu non exivi; et quomodo hoc alicui dicere potui?"
-->
  His master of horse answered him thus:
  "My lord king, you know that after I gave you this advice
  I have not left your sight; how could I have told this to anyone?
</p>

<p>
<!--
Tunc rex ad Aldonem et Grausonem misit, interrogans eos, ut quid in locum sanctum confugium fecissent.
-->
  Then the king sent to Aldo and Grauso, asking them why they'd taken refuge in
  a place of sanctuary.

<!--
Qui respondentes dixerunt: "Quia nuntiatum est nobis quod nos dominus rex occidere vellet".
-->
  And they replied, saying:
  "Because it was reported to us that the lord king wished to kill us."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Iterato rex misit ad eos, sciscitans quis fuerit ille qui eis nuntiaverit, mandans eis ut, nisi ei nuntiatorem proderent, eius gratiam invenire non possint.
-->
  The king sent to them a second time, asking who it was that had reported this
  to them, commanding them that unless they revealed the informer to him,
  they wouldn't be able to gain his goodwill.

<!--
Tunc illi sicut factum fuerat regi mandaverunt, dicentes, claudum hominem obvium se habuisse, qui unum pedem truncatum habebat et genu tenus crure ligneo utebatur, et hunc fuisse sui interitus nuntium.
-->
  Then they confided it to the king, just as it had happened, saying
  that a lame man had stood in their way, who had one foot cut off and
  was using a wooden shank up to his knee,
  and the ruined man had reported this to them.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Tunc intellexit rex muscam illam cui pedem truncaverat malignum spiritum fuisse et ipsum sui secreti consilia prodidisse.
-->
  Then the king realized that that the fly whose foot he'd cut off
  was a spiteful spirit and had itself revealed the plans of his secret.

<!--
Qui statim Aldonem et Grausonem in sua fide de eadem basilica suscipiens, eisdem culpam pepercit et in reliquum eosdem in loco fidelium habuit.
-->
  And he, at once receiving Aldo and Grauso in his trust from the same basilica,
  absolved them of blame and held them in a position of trust in the future.
