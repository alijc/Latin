<h4>The King and the Fly</h4>

<p>
<!--
Rex vero Cunincpert dum post haec cum stratore suo, 
qui lingua propria marpahis dicitur,
consilium iniret in civitate Ticinensi quomodo Aldonem et Grausonem vita privare deberet, 
repente in fenestra iuxta quam consistebant una de maiusculis musca consedit;
quam Cunincpert cultello ut extingueret percutere volens, eius tantum pedem abscidit.
-->
  In fact, after this, while King Cunincpert was hatching a plot with his master
  of horse (who in their own language is called "marpahis") in the city of
  Ticinum, of how they might deprive Aldo and Grauso of their lives,
  suddenly one of the larger flies alighted in the window next to where they were standing.
  Cunincpert wished to strike it with a dagger, in order to kill it,
  but only cut its foot off.

<!--
Aldo vero et Grauso dum ad palatium regis consilium nescientes venirent,
cum basilicae sancti Romani martyris, quae prope palatium sita est, 
propinquassent, repente eis obvius quidam claudus uno pede truncato factus est;
qui eis dixit quod eos Cunincpert, si ad eum pergerent, occisurus esset.
-->
  And truly, when Aldo and Grauso, knowing nothing of the plot,
  came to the royal palace
  and had gotten close to the basilica of the holy Roman martyr,
  which is situated near the palace,
  suddenly their way was blocked by a certain man, lame in one maimed foot;
  who told them that if they went on to Cunincpert, he was going to kill them.

<!--
Qui haec audientes, magno timore correpti, post altarium eiusdem basilicae confugiere.
-->
  And when they heard this, they were seized with dread, and took refuse behind
  the altar of the same basilica.
