<h4>On cultivating letters</h4>

<p>
<!--
Karolus, gratia dei rex Francorum et Langobardorum ac patricius
Romanorum Baugulfo abbati et omni congregationi, tibi etiam
commissis fidelibus, oratoribus nostris, in omnipotentis dei
nomine amabilem direximus salutem.
-->
Charles, by the grace of God the king of the Franks and Lombards
and the patrician of the Romans, to Abbot Baugulfus and his whole community,
also to the faithful entrusted to you, and to our clerics,
we direct amiable greetings in the name of almighty God.

<!--
Cum nobis in his annis a nonnullis monasteriis saepius scripta
dirigerentur, in quibus, quod pro nobis fratres ibidem
commorantes in sacris et piis orationibus decertarent,
significaretur, cognovimus in plurimis praefatis conscriptionibus
eorundem et sensus rectos et sermones incultos; quia, quod pia
devotio interius fideliter dictabat, hoc exterius propter
neglegentiam discendi lingua inerudita exprimere sine
reprehensione non valebat.
-->
Since, in recent years, several monasteries have often sent us letters,
which show that the brothers living there are wont to strive for us in holy
and pious speeches,
we find both correct thoughts and uncouth expressions
in many of these same afore-mentioned writings;
for, whatever conscientious devotion one was faithfully stating innwardly,
he could not manage to squeeze it out faultlessly in a poorly learned
language. 

<!--
Unde factum est ut timere inciperemus ne forte, sicut minor erat
in scribendo prudentia, ita quoque et multo minor esset quam
recte esse debuisset sanctarum scripturarum ad intellegendum
sapientia.
-->
And from this it happened that we began to fear that perhaps,
since there was little skill in writing, there might also be less skill
than would be needed in understanding the wisdom of the holy scripture.

<!--
Et bene novimus omnes quia, quamvis periculosi sint errores
verborum, multi periculosiores sunt errores sensuum.
-->
And we all well know that, although errors of words are dangerous,
errors of thought are much more dangerous.

Quamobrem hortamur vos litterarum studia non solum non neglegere,
verum etiam humillima et Deo placita intentione ad hoc certatim discere, 
ut facilius et rectius divinarum scripturarum mysteria valeatis penetrare.
-->
  Therefore we urge you not only to not neglect the study of letters,
  but truly to also eagerly gain a concentration that is so humble and pleasing
  to God for this purpose, to more easily and correctly succeed in penetrating
  the mysteries of sacred scriptures.

<!--
Cum autem in sacris paginis schemata, 
tropi et cetera his similia inserta inveniantur, nulli dubium est, 
quod ea unusquisque legens tanto citius spiritualiter intellegit, 
quanto prius in litterarum magisterio plenius instructus fuerit.
-->
  And when figures of speech, tropes and other such things are found
  inserted into these sacred pages, there is no doubt that each man,
  reading them rapidly, understands them much more, in the spiritual sense,
  than he might have done before he was trained in the mastery of letters.

<!--
Tales vero ad hoc opus viri eligantur, qui et voluntatem et possibilitatem
 discendi et desiderium habeant alios instruendi.
-->
  Indeed, let the men who are chosen for this work be such
  that they will acquire both purpose and ability,
  and let them have the desire to teach other men.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Et hoc tantum ea intentione agatur, qua devotione a nobis praecipitur.
-->
  And let this only be done with a purpose,
  and let this earnestness be taught by us.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Optamus enim vos, sicut decet ecclesiae milites, et interius devotos et
exterius doctos castosque bene vivendo et scholasticos bene loquendo, 
ut quicumque vos propter nomen Domini et sanctae conversationis nobilitatem
ad videndum expetierit, sicut de aspectu vestro aedificatur visus,
ita quoque de sapientia vestra, quam in legendo seu cantando perceperit,
instructus omnipotenti Domino gratias agendo gaudens redeat.
-->
  For, as is fitting for soldiers of the church, we choose you,
  who are both more devoted in spirit and better trained and virtuous in
  discourse for living well and schooled in speaking,
  so that whoever wishes to see you on account of the name of the Lord
  and your reputation of holy conduct,
  just as his sight is edified by your appearance,
  so also by your wisdom,
  which he gains in reading or recitation,
  instructed by the almighty Lord, and goes away giving thanks and rejoicing.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Huius itaque epistolae exemplaria ad omnes suffragantes tuosque coepiscopos
et per universa monasteria dirigi non neglegas, si gratiam nostram habere vis.
-->
  And so, take care that you not neglect to have copies of this letter
  directed to all assistants and fellow-bishops and through all the monasteries,
  if you wish to have our goodwill.
