     Karolus, gratia dei rex Francorum et Langobardorum ac patricius
     Romanorum Baugulfo abbati et omni congregationi, tibi etiam
     commissis fidelibus, oratoribus nostris, in omnipotentis dei
     nomine amabilem direximus salutem.

GAE  Charles, by the grace of God the king of the Franks and the
     Lombards and patrician of the Romans, to the abbot Baugolfo and
     to the whole congregation and to the faithful entrusted to you,
     through our clerics in the name of the omnipotent God, we direct
     a friendly greeting.

JEI  Charles, by the grace of God King of the Franks and Lombards and
     Patrician of the Romans, to Abbot Baugulf and all your flock,
     also to the faithful committed to you, our clerics, in the name
     of Almighty God we have directed our friendly greeting.

MJD  Charlemagne, being by the grace of God king of the Franks
     andLombards and emperor of the Romans, to the abbot Baugolf and
     all ofhis congregation, to you also as faithful delegates, our
     clerics, inthe name of almighty God we have sent an amiable
     greeting.

WW   Charles, by the grace of God, king of the Franks and the Lombards
     and the patron of the Romans, Abbot Baugulfus along with all the
     congregation, and even the faithful and our clerics have been
     gathered and in the name of almighty God - we send to you a
     loving greeting.

     Cum nobis in his annis a nonnullis monasteriis saepius scripta
     dirigerentur, in quibus, quod pro nobis fratres ibidem
     commorantes in sacris et piis orationibus decertarent,
     significaretur, cognovimus in plurimis praefatis conscriptionibus
     eorundem et sensus rectos et sermones incultos; quia, quod pia
     devotio interius fideliter dictabat, hoc exterius propter
     neglegentiam discendi lingua inerudita exprimere sine
     reprehensione non valebat.

GAE  Since in these years letters are quite often sent to us from some
     monasteries in which it is indicated that brothers dwelling in
     the same place contend for us in sacred and pious prayers, we
     perceived in very many of their aforementioned letters both right
     senses and uncouth words; because, what pious devotion faithfully
     dictated interiorly, unlearned language, on account of the
     neglect of learning, was not able to express exteriorly without
     censure.

JEI  Whereas quite often in recent years from a number of monasteries
     there have been directed to us writings in which it was indicated
     that the brothers staying in the same place were contending in
     sacred and pious prayers for us, we have recognized in many of
     the aforesaid writings both correct thoughts and uncouth
     expressions; since what pious devotion suggested faithfully
     internally (in the mind), because of neglect of learning it did
     not succeed in expressing this externally (in writing) without
     fault in uneducated language.

MJD  When in recent years writings from a number of
     monasteries were morefrequently being sent to us, writings in
     which, because it wasindicated that the brothers who were
     dwelling together there werestriving in holy and devout prayers
     for our benefit, we knew that invery many of the aforesaid
     documents of the same men there were bothcorrect thoughts and
     uncouth expressions; we knew that, althoughtheir pious devotion
     was faithfully composing in the mind, anuneducated tongue could
     not express this in the letter withoutcriticism on account of a
     neglect of learning.

WW   Since writings from several monasteries have often been directed
     to us in recent years, and in these writings it may be indicated
     to us what the brothers were struggling with, delaying there in
     the sacred and holy orations, we have come to recognize in many
     of the writings mentioned above there are correct thoughts and
     uncouth expressions, because what righteous piety was trying to
     say in the mind, it was not able to say externally because of the
     neglect of learning and so they express it in uneducated language
     without criticism.
                                ------

     Unde factum est ut timere inciperemus ne forte, sicut minor erat
     in scribendo prudentia, ita quoque et multo minor esset quam
     recte esse debuisset sanctarum scripturarum ad intellegendum
     sapientia.

GAE  From this it happened that we began to fear that perhaps, just as
     the skill in writing was rather small, so even more the skill in
     understanding the sacred Scriptures might be less than it rightly
     ought to be.

JEI  Hence it has come about that we began to fear lest perchance,
     just as there was less skill in writing, so also there might be
     much less than there rightly should in knowledgable understanding
     of the sacred scriptures.

MJD  For this reasonit came to pass that we began to be afraid that
     perhaps, just astheir skill in writing was less, so also their
     soundness of mind forthe understanding of the holy scriptures was
     much less correct thanit was bound to be.

WW   From this we began to fear lest, just as there was little skill
     in the writing, so also it might be much more than a little that
     is required to be correct in the wisdom of understanding of the
     holy scriptures.
                                ------

     Et bene novimus omnes quia, quamvis periculosi sint errores
     verborum, multi periculosiores sunt errores sensuum.

GAE  And we all know well that, however much errors of words might be
     dangerous, many errors of the senses are more dangerous.

JEI  And we all well know that however dangerous errors of words may
     be, much more dangerous are errors of thought.

MJD  And well we allunderstood that, although errors of words are
     dangerous, errors ofimpressions issuing from the senses are much
     more dangerous.

WW   And we all know well that however dangerous are the errors of
     words, the errors of thought are much worse.
