<h4>THE LAST OF THE MEROVINGIANS</h4>

<p>START</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Gens Merovingorum, de qua Franci reges sibi creare soliti erant,
usque in Hildricum regem, qui iussu Stephani, Romani pontificis,
depositus ac detonsus atque in monasterium trusus est, durasse putatur.
-->
  The Merovingian tribe, that French kings were wont to appoint themselves from,
  up to King Hildricus, who by the order of Stephan, the pontiff of Rome,
  was deposed and shorn and shoved into a monastery, is thought to have endured.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quae licet in illo finita possit videri tamen iam dudum nullius vigoris erat,
nec quicquam in se clarum praeter inane regis vocabulum praeferebat.
-->
  And it is possible in that end that it can seem that not long ago it had
  no vigor, nor anything in itself besides the plain hollow name of 'king'
  that it carried.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Nam et opes et potentia regni penes palatii praefectos, 
qui maiores domus dicebantur, et ad quos summa imperii pertinebat, tenebantur.
-->
  For both the wealth and the power of the kingdom were held in the hands
  of the palace prefects, who were called the mayors of the palace,
  and it extended the summits of authority to them.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Neque regi aliud relinquebatur quam ut regio tantum nomine contentus,
crine profuso, barba summissa, 
solio resideret ac speciem dominantis effingeret,
legatos undecumque venientes audiret, eisque abeuntibus responsa, 
quae erat edoctus vel etiam iussus, ex sua velut potestate redderet;
cum praeter inutile regis nomen et precarium vitae stipendium, 
quod ei praefectus aulae prout videbatur exhibebat, 
nihil aliud proprii possideret quam unam et eam praeparvi reditus villam,
in qua domum et ex qua famulos sibi necessaria ministrantes 
atque obsequium exhibentes paucae numerositatis habebat.
-->
  And nothing else of the king was left, except to sit on the throne,
  content with such a royal name, excessive hair, and long beards,
  and to create the appearance of rule,
  to give audience to ambassadors coming from everywhich place,
  and upon their departure to deliver the answers,
  which he had been told, or even ordered, as if by his own power.
  When besides the useless name of 'king' and precarious wages of life,
  which the prefect of the court furnished to him just as it seemed,
  to possess anothing other than his single villa of very small income,
  in which house and from which he had servants the supplying him necessities
  and exhibiting servility of a small multitude.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quocumque eundum erat carpento ibat,
quod bubus iunctis et bubulco rustico more agente trahebatur.
-->
  Wherever he had to go he went by carriage, because he was habitually hauled by
  a yoke of oxen with a country plowman driving.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Sic ad palatium, sic ad publicum populi sui conventum, 
qui annuatim ob regni utilitatem celebrabatur, ire, sic domum redire solebat.
-->
  Thus to the palace, thus to the public assembly of his people
  he who was honored every year for the advantage of the kingdom,
  thus to return home he was wont to go.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
At regni administrationem et omnia quae 
vel domi vel foris agenda ac disponenda erant praefectus aulae procurabat.
-->
  But the administration of the kingdom and all which either at home or abroad
  for doing and disposing was managed by the prefect of the court.
