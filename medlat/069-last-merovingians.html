<h4>THE LAST OF THE MEROVINGIANS</h4>

<p>
<!--
Gens Merovingorum, de qua Franci reges sibi creare soliti erant,
usque in Hildricum regem, qui iussu Stephani, Romani pontificis,
depositus ac detonsus atque in monasterium trusus est, durasse putatur.
-->
  The Merovingian tribe, from which the Franks were wont to appoint their kings,
  up until King Hildricus, who by the order of Stephan, the pontiff of Rome,
  was deposed and tonsured and forced into a monastery,
  is thought to have endured.

<!--
Quae licet in illo finita possit videri tamen iam dudum nullius vigoris erat,
nec quicquam in se clarum praeter inane regis vocabulum praeferebat.
-->
But it is possible that it can seem that the tribe had been ended in that king,
for a long ago it had no vigor, nor anything in itself besides the plain hollow
name of 'king' that it carried.

<!--
Nam et opes et potentia regni penes palatii praefectos, 
qui maiores domus dicebantur, et ad quos summa imperii pertinebat, tenebantur.
-->
  For both the wealth and the power of the kingdom were held in the hands
  of the palace prefects, who were called the mayors of the palace,
  and the utmost of authority extended to them.

<p>
<!--
Neque regi aliud relinquebatur quam ut regio tantum nomine contentus,
crine profuso, barba summissa, 
solio resideret ac speciem dominantis effingeret,
legatos undecumque venientes audiret, eisque abeuntibus responsa, 
quae erat edoctus vel etiam iussus, ex sua velut potestate redderet;
cum praeter inutile regis nomen et precarium vitae stipendium, 
quod ei praefectus aulae prout videbatur exhibebat, 
nihil aliud proprii possideret quam unam et eam praeparvi reditus villam,
in qua domum et ex qua famulos sibi necessaria ministrantes 
atque obsequium exhibentes paucae numerositatis habebat.
-->
  And nothing else was left to the king, except to sit on the throne,
  content with such a royal title, excessive hair, and a long beard,
  and to create the appearance of rule,
  to give audience to ambassadors coming from everywhich place,
  and upon their departure to deliver the answers
  that he had been told, or even ordered, to give, as if by his own power.
  When besides the useless name of 'king' and precarious wages of life,
  which the prefect of the court furnished to him as seemed fit,
  to possess anothing other than a single estate of a very small income,
  in which he had a house and a few servants the supplying him his needs
  and showing servility.

<!--
Quocumque eundum erat carpento ibat,
quod bubus iunctis et bubulco rustico more agente trahebatur.
-->
  Wherever he had to go he went in a cart that was usually drawn by
  a yoke of oxen with a country plowman driving.

<!--
Sic ad palatium, sic ad publicum populi sui conventum, 
qui annuatim ob regni utilitatem celebrabatur, ire, sic domum redire solebat.
-->
In this way he was wont to travel to the palace,
and in this way to the public assembly of his people,
that was held every year for the advantage of the kingdom,
and in this way to return home.

<!--
At regni administrationem et omnia quae 
vel domi vel foris agenda ac disponenda erant praefectus aulae procurabat.
-->
  But the administration of the kingdom and all which either at home or abroad
  for doing and disposing was managed by the prefect of the court.
