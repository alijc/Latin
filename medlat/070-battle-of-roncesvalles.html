<h4>The Battle of Roncesvalles</h4>
 
<p>START</p>

<!--
Cum enim assiduo ac paene continuo cum Saxonibus bello certaretur,
dispositis per congrua confiniorum loca praesidiis, 
Hispaniam quam maximo poterat belli apparatu adgreditur; 
saltuque Pyrenaei superato, 
omnibus quae adierat oppidis atque castellis in deditionem acceptis, 
salvo et incolomi exercitu revertitur, 
praeter quod in ipso Pyrenaei iugo Wasconicam perfidiam parumper
in redeundo contigit experiri.
-->
  For when the incessant and nearly constant war with the Saxons was over
  and garrisons were posted at suitable locations on the borders,
  Charlemagne attacked Spain with as much preparation as possible.
  After taking the Pyrenees in a blitz and accepting the surrenders
  of all the cities and castles that he had attacked,
  he withdrew, with his army safe and sound,
  except for a brief treachery of the Basques against him on a ridge of
  the Pyrenees that he experienced while he was returning.

Nam cum agmine longo, ut loci et angustiarum situs permittebat, 
porrectus iret exercitus, Wascones in summi montis vertice positis insidiis 
(est enim locus ex opacitate silvarum, quarum ibi maxima est copia, 
insidiis ponendis oportunus) 
extremam impedimentorum partem et eos qui novissimi agminis incedentes subsidio 
praecedentes tuebantur desuper incursantes in subiectam vallem deiciunt, 
consertoque cum eis proelio usque ad unum omnes interficiunt ac, 
direptis impedimentis, noctis beneficio quae iam instabat protecti, 
summa cum celeritate in diversa disperguntur.
-->
  For as the army marched, extended in a long column,
  as was forced by the situation of the locale and its passes,
  the Basques set an ambush on the peak of a high mountain
  (For the best spot for setting an ambush is there, where the 
  darkness of the forests is the greatest).
  They attacked the outer part of the baggage train and the men
  who were marching in front of the end of the column
  to guard against raiders, forcing them into the valley below,
  and, engaging them in battle, killed them all, to a man.
  Then, after pillaging the baggage train, they
  scattered to the winds at top speed, under the cover of the gathering night.

<!--
Adiuvabat in hoc facto Wascones et levitas armorum et loci in quo res gerebatur situs;
e contra Francos et armorum gravitas et loci iniquitas per omnia Wasconibus reddidit impares.
-->
  In this event both the lightness of their armor and the situation of the spot
  where the fight took place aided the the Basques;
  on the other hand the weight of their armor and the unevenness of the terrain
  rendered the Franks inferior to the Basques in all respects.

<!--
In quo proelio Eggihardus, regiae mensae praepositus, Anshelmus, 
comes palatii et Hruodlandus Brittannici limitis praefectus 
cum aliis conpluribus interficiuntur.
-->
  And in this battle Eggihard, the lord high steward, Anshelm,
  the judge of the palace court, and Hruodland, the margrave of Brittany
  were killed, along with many others.

<!--
Neque hoc factum ad praesens vindicari poterat quia hostis re perpetrata 
ita dispersus est ut ne fama quidem remaneret ubinam gentium quaeri potuisset.
-->
  And to the present day it has not been possible to avenge this deed,
  for after the enemy carried it out, they were dispersed so widely
  that no report remained of where in the world they might be searched for.
