<h4>PORTRAIT OF CHARLEMAGNE</h4>
 
<p>START</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
 Corpore fuit amplo atque robusto, statura eminenti,
 quae tamen iustam non excederet
 (nam septem suorum pedum proceritatem eius constat habuisse mensuram),
 apice capitis rotundo, oculis praegrandibus ac vegetis, 
 naso paululum mediocritatem excedenti, canitie pulchra, facie laeta et hilari. 
-->
  He was large and robust in body and lofty in stature,
  yet had normal proportions
  (for it is agreed the the measure of his height was seven of his feet),
  with the top of his head round, his eyes large and bright,
  his nose a bit smaller than average, his white hair beautiful,
  and his face cheerful and lively.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Unde formae auctoritas ac dignitas tam stanti quam sedenti plurima adquirebatur.
-->
  And from this he gained the greatest possible authority and dignity
  of his appearance whether standing or sitting.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quamquam cervix obesa et brevior venterque proiectior videretur,
tamen haec ceterorum membrorum celabat aequalitas. 
-->
  Although his neck was stout and short and his belly seemed to jut out,
  still the symmetry of his other limbs concealed this.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Incessu firmo totaque corporis habitudine virili; 
voce clara quidem, sed quae minus corporis formae conveniret.
-->
  With his gait steady and the whole condition of his body manly;
  with a voice that was truly loud, but which didn't match the
  appearance of his body very well.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Valitudine prospera, praeter quod, antequam decederet, 
per quatuor annos crebro febribus corripiebatur, 
ad extremum etiam uno pede claudicaret. 
-->
  He was fortunate in his health, except that, in the four years
  before he died, he was frequently laid low by fevers,
  and at the very end he was lame in one foot.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Et tunc quidem plura suo arbitratu quam medicorum consilio faciebat;
quos paene exosos habebat, quod ei in cibis assa, quibus assuetus erat,
dimittere et elixis adsuescere suadebant.
-->
  And even then he acted more by his own judgment than by the advice of his doctors,
  whom he held as mostly odious, because they urged him to renounce the roasted
  meat in his diet, which he was used to, and to get used to boiled meat.
