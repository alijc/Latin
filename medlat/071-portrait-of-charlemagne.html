<h4>PORTRAIT OF CHARLEMAGNE</h4>
 
<p>
<!--
 Corpore fuit amplo atque robusto, statura eminenti,
 quae tamen iustam non excederet
 (nam septem suorum pedum proceritatem eius constat habuisse mensuram),
 apice capitis rotundo, oculis praegrandibus ac vegetis, 
 naso paululum mediocritatem excedenti, canitie pulchra, facie laeta et hilari. 
-->
  He was large and robust in body and lofty in stature,
  yet had normal proportions
  (for it is agreed the the measure of his height was seven of his feet),
  with the top of his head round, his eyes large and bright,
  his nose a bit larger than average, his white hair beautiful,
  and his face cheerful and lively.

<!--
Unde formae auctoritas ac dignitas tam stanti quam sedenti plurima adquirebatur.
-->
  And from this he gained the greatest possible authority and dignity
  of his appearance whether standing or sitting.

<!--
Quamquam cervix obesa et brevior venterque proiectior videretur,
tamen haec ceterorum membrorum celabat aequalitas. 
-->
  Although his neck was stout and short and his belly seemed to jut out,
  still the symmetry of his other limbs concealed this.

<!--
Incessu firmo totaque corporis habitudine virili; 
voce clara quidem, sed quae minus corporis formae conveniret.
-->
  With his gait steady and the whole condition of his body manly;
  with a voice that was truly loud, but which didn't match the
  appearance of his body very well.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Valitudine prospera, praeter quod, antequam decederet, 
per quatuor annos crebro febribus corripiebatur, 
ad extremum etiam uno pede claudicaret. 
-->
  He was fortunate in his health, except that, in the four years
  before he died, he was frequently laid low by fevers,
  and at the very end he was lame in one foot.

<!--
Et tunc quidem plura suo arbitratu quam medicorum consilio faciebat;
quos paene exosos habebat, quod ei in cibis assa, quibus assuetus erat,
dimittere et elixis adsuescere suadebant.
-->
  And even then he acted more by his own judgment than by the advice of his doctors,
  whom he held as mostly odious, because they urged him to renounce the roasted
  meat in his diet, which he was used to, and to get used to boiled meat.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Exercebatur assidue equitando ac venando; quod illi gentilicium erat; 
vix ulla in terris natio invenitur, quae in hac arte Francis possit aequari.
-->
  He regularly exercised in riding and hunting, which came to him naturally;
  scarcely any nation in any land can be found that can equal the Franks in
  this skill. 
</p>

<p>
<!--
Delectabatur etiam vaporibus aquarum naturaliter calentium, 
frequenti natatu corpus exercens; cuius adeo peritus fuit, 
ut nullus ei iuste valeat anteferri.
-->
  He also took delight in the steam of hot springs,
  exercising his body in frequent swims;
  in which he had so much skill that, in all fairness, no-one could outdo him.

<!--
Ob hoc etiam Aquisgrani regiam exstruxit
 ibique extremis vitae annis usque ad obitum perpetim habitavit.
-->
  For this reason he built a palace at Aix and in his final years
  lived there without intermission until his death.

<!--
Et non solum filios ad balneum, verum optimates et amicos,
aliquando etiam satellitum et custodum corporis turbam invitavit, 
ita ut nonnumquam centum vel eo amplius homines una lavarentur.
-->
  And he invited not only his sons to bathe, but even his nobles and friends,
  and at times also a crowd of attendents and bodyguards,
  so that sometimes a hundred or more men wre bathing together with him.
</p>

<p>
<!--
In cibo et potu temperans, sed in potu temperantior, 
quippe qui ebrietatem in qualicumque homine, 
nedum in se ac suis, plurimum abhominabatur.
-->
  He was oderate in food and drink, but more so in drink - in fact
  he loathed drunkeness beyond measure in any sort of man,
  and particularly in himself and his men.

<!--
Cibo enim non adeo abstinere poterat,
 ut saepe quereretur noxia corpori suo esse ieiunia.
-->
  For he could not abstain from food for long,
  so that he often complained that fast days were harmful to his body.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Convivabatur rarissime, et hoc praecipuis tantum festivitatibus,
 tunc tamen cum magno hominum numero.
-->
  He would rarely give dinners, and that too only on particular feast days,
  yet then with a great number of people.
