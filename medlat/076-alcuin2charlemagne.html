<h4>ALCUIN TO CHARLEMAGNE</h4>

<p>
<!--
Domino piissimo et praestantissimo et omni honore dignissimo David
regi Flaccus Albinus verae beatitudinis aeternam in Christo salutem.
-->
  To the most pious and outstanding and in every respect most worthy lord,
  King David, Flaccus Alcuin wishes the eternal salvation of true blessedness
  in Christ.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Ego vero Flaccus vester secundum exhortationem et bonam voluntatem vestram
aliis per tecta sancti Martini sanctarum mella scripturarum ministrare satago;
alios vetere antiquarum disciplinarum mero inebriare studeo;
alios grammaticae subtilitatis enutrire pomis incipiam;
quosdam stellarum ordine, ceu pictor cuiuslibet magnae domus culmina,
illuminare gestio.
-->
  Indeed I, your servant Flaccus, following your encouragement and good will,
  am busy supplying to some throughout the houses of Saint Martin
  the sweet honey of the sacred scriptures.
  I yearn to intoxicate others with the pure old wine of ancient teachings.
  I will undertake to nurture others with the fruit of grammatical subtlety.
  And I am eager to illuminate some in the order of the stars,
  just as some painter does to the ceiling of a great house.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Plurima plurimis factus ut plurimos ad profectum sanctae Dei ecclesiae
et ad decorem imperialis regni vestri erudiam, 
ne sit vacua Dei omnipotentis in me gratia nec vestrae bonitatis largitio inanis.
-->
  I have been many things to many people,
  in order to instruct many for the profit of God's holy church 
  and for the decorum of your imperial kingdom,
  that the grace of all-powerful God not be empty in me,
  and that the generosity of your kindness not be in vain.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Sed ex parte desunt mihi servulo vestro exquisitiores eruditionis scholasticae libelli, 
quos habui in patriam per bonam et devotissimam magistri mei industriam,
vel etiam mei ipsius qualemcumque sudorem.
-->
  But to some extent it seems to me, your humble servant,
  that there is a lack of the better books of scholastic education
  that I had in my homeland through my teacher's good and devoted industry,
  and even through my own hard labor, such as it was.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Ideo haec vestrae excellentiae dico, 
ne forte vestro placeat totius sapientiae desiderantissimo consilio, 
ut aliquos ex pueris nostris remittam
 qui excipiant inde nobis necessaria quaeque, 
et revehant in Franciam flores Britanniae; 
ut non sit tantummodo in Euborica hortus conclusus
sed in Turonica emissiones paradisi cum pomorum fructibus, 
ut veniens Auster perflaret hortos Ligeri fluminis,
et fluant aromata illius et novissime fiat, quod sequitur in Cantico,
unde hoc adsumpsi paradigma:
"Veniat dilectus meus in hortum suum et comedat fructum pomorum suorum.
-->
  For that reason I tell your excellency my plan,
  in hopes that it might perchance please you,
  that I send some of our lads back to Britain,
  to remove from there whatever is needful for us,
  and bring the flowers of Britain back to France.
  Then there could be an enclosed garden not only in York 
  but in Tours as well - flowers of Paradise with fruit-laden trees -
  so that the South Wind might come and blow over the gardens of the Loire,
  letting their sweet odors flow and at last allowing to happen
  what follows in the Song of Songs, from which I took this metaphor:
  "Let my beloved come into his garden and eat the fruit of his trees.

<!--
Et dicat adulescentulis suis: 
'Comedite, amici mei, bibite et inebriamini, carissimi.'
-->
  And let him say to his young men:
  'Eat, my friends, drink and be merry, dear ones.'

<!--
Ego dormio, et cor meum vigilat."
-->
  I am asleep, but my heart is awake."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Vel illud exhortativum ad sapientiam discendam Isaiae prophetae elogium: 
"Omnes sitientes venite ad aquas; 
et qui non habetis argentum, properate, emite et comedite; 
venite, emite absque argento et absque ulla commutatione vinum et lac."
-->
  Or that maxim of the prophet Isaiah, urging one to learn wisdom:
  "All you who thirst, come to the waters;
  and you who do not have silver, be quick, buy and eat;
  come, buy wine and milk without silver and without any exchange."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Haec sunt quae vestra nobilissima intentio non ignorat, 
quomodo per omnes sanctae scripturae paginas exhortamur ad sapientiam discendam.
-->
  These are the things that your most noble purpose is not unaware of,
  how we are encouraged to learn wisdom in all the pages of holy scripture.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Nil esse ad beatam vitam sublimius adipiscendam, 
nil ad exercitium iucundius,
nil contra vitia fortius, 
nil in omni dignitate laudabilius; 
etiam et, secundum philosophorum dicta, 
nil ad regendum populum necessarius, 
nil ad componendam vitam in optimos mores melius 
quam sapientiae decus et disciplinae laus et eruditionis efficacia.
-->
  There is nothing loftier for securing a blessed life,
  nothing more pleasant for practice,
  nothing more powerful against sin,
  nothing more praiseworthy in any lofty station
  and also, according to the words of philosophers,
  nothing more necessary for ruling a people,
  nothing better for arranging a life in the best morals than
  the honor of wisdom, the praise of discipline and the virtue of learning.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Unde et de laude illius sapientissimus exclamat Salomon: 
"Melior est sapientia cunctis pretiosissimis, 
et omne desiderabile ei non potest comparari.
-->
  Whence even the most wise Solomon exclaims about the glory of wisdom:
  "Wisdom is better than every precious thing,
  and everything desired can not be compared to it.

<!--
Haec est quae humiles exaltat, quae sublimes honorat.
-->
  This wisdom is what exalts the humble, what honors the exalted.

<!--
Per illam reges regnant et legum conditores iusta decernunt.
-->
  It is what allows kings to reign and lawgivers to ordain justice.

<!--
Per illam principes imperant et potentes decernunt iustitiam.
-->
  It allows princes to rule and the powerful to decree justice.

<!--
Beati qui custodiunt vias eius, et beati qui vigilant ad fores illius cotidie."
-->
  Blessed are they who guard its ways,
  and blessed those who watch at its doors every day."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Ad hanc omni studio discendam et cotidiano exercitio possidendam exhortare, 
domne rex, iuvenes quosque in palatio excellentiae vestrae, 
quatenus in ea proficiant aetate florida, 
ut ad honorem canitiem suam perducere digni habeantur et 
per eam ad perpetuam valeant pervenire beatitudinem.
-->
  My lord king, encourage all the youths in your excellency's palace 
  to learn this with all zeal and to master it in daily practice,
  however much they might accomplish in it in their blooming age,
  so that they might be held to pass their old age in honor of worth and
  through it they may prevail to arrive at everlasting blessedness.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Ego vero, secundum modum ingenioli mei,
apud servos vestros in his partibus seminare sapientiae grana segnis non ero, 
memor illius sententiae: 
"Mane semina semen tuum et vespere non cesset manus tua; 
quia nescis quid magis oriatur, hoc an illud.
-->
  Indeed, I, according to the measure of my natural capacity, won't be slow
  in planting the seeds of wisdom among your subjects in these regions,
  mindful of this statement:
  "Sow your seed in the morning and don't let your hand rest in the evening;
  for you don't know which will grow better, this one or that one.

<!--
Et si utraque simul, melius est."
-->
  And if both are the same, it is better."

<!--
Mane, florentibus per aetatem studiis, seminavi in Britannia.
-->
  In the morning I sowed in Britain.
  with studies that have flourished for a generation.

<!--
Nunc vero, frigescente sanguine, quasi vespere in Francia seminare non cesso,
utraque enim, Dei gratia donante, oriri optans.
-->
  Now however, with my blood growing cold, as if in the evening,
  I do not rest from sowing in France,
  hoping that both, God's grace granting, will grow.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Mihi, fracto corpore, solacio est sententia sancti Hieronymi, 
qui ait in epistulam ad Nepotianum: 
"Omnes paene virtutes corporis mutantur in senibus et, 
crescente sola sapientia, decrescunt cetera."
-->
  Though my body is broken, I have for solace the pronouncement of Saint Jerome,
  who said in a letter to Nepotianus:
  "Nearly all the strengths of the body are altered in the old and,
  while only wisdom increases, the others decline."

<!--
Et post paululum: 
"Senectus vero eorum qui adulescentiam suam honestis artibus instruxerunt 
et in lege Domini meditati sunt die ac nocte, aetate fit doctior, usu tritior,
processu temporis sapientior; et veterum studiorum dulcissimos fructus metit."
-->
  And a little later:
  "Truly, the old age of those who prepared their youth in noble accomplishments
  and pondered on the Lord's law day and night,
  becomes more learned with age, more familiar with experience,
  wiser with the advance of time;
  and reaps the sweetest fruits of their long-standing studies."

<!--
In qua epistula de sapientiae laude et veterum studiis plura potest,  
cui placuerit, 
legere et intellegere quantum veteres in decore sapientiae florere studuerunt.
-->
  And in this letter whoever wishes can read and understand
  much about the glory of wisdom and the studies of old times,
  and how much the ancients strove to flourish in the splendor of wisdom.
