<h4>A MEDIEVAL TARQUIN</h4>
 
<p>START</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Sed extraneorum victor Karolus a propriis est mira quidem
sed cassa fraude circumventus.
-->
  But Charles, the conqueror of foreigners, was beset
  by his own men in a plot that was strange indeed, but vain.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Nam de Sclavis ad Reginam regressus, a filio per concubinam
progenito, nomine gloriosissimi Pippini a matre ominaliter insignito,
paene captus et, quantum in eo fuit est morti damnatus.
-->
  For, while retiring from Sclavia to Regensburg, he was nearly captured
  by a son born of a concubine, whose mother had ominously marked him
  with the name of most glorious Pippin,
  and as far as it was in Pippin's power, Charles was condemned to death.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quod hoc modo compertum est.
-->
  Which was ascertained in this way.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Cum in ecclesia sancti Petri proceribus congregatis de
morte imperatoris consiliatus fuisset, finito consilio, "omnia
tuta timens" iussit explorare si quis usquam in angulis aut subter
altaribus fuisset absconsus; et ecce, ut timuerunt, invenerunt unum
clericum subtus altare celatum.
-->
  When Pippin had deliberated on the death of the emperor in the church of
  Saint Peter with assembled nobles, after the debate was over,
  "fearing everything safe", he ordered them to see if anyone was hidden
  anywhere in the corners or beneath the altar;
  and lo, as they feared, they found one priest concealed below the altar.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quem apprehendentes ad iusiurandum compulerunt ne proditor
molitionis eorum fieret.
-->
  And they seized him and forced him to swear an oath not to betray their plot.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Qui ne vitam perderet, ut dictaverunt, iurare non abnuit.
-->
  He, to keep from losing his life, did not refuse to swear as they dictated.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Sed illis recedentibus, iuramentum illud sacrilegum parvi pendens, ad
palatium properavit.
-->
  But after they withdrew, he, caring little for that sacrilegious oath,
  hurried to the palace.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Cumque cum maxima difficultate per septem seras et ostia tandem
ad cubiculum imperatoris penetrasset, pulsato aditu, vigilantissimum
semper Karolum ad maximam perduxit admirationem quis eo tempore eum
praesumeret inquietare.
-->
  And after he had finally penetrated, with the greatest difficulty,
  through seven locks and doors to the bedchamber of the emperor,
  he beat on the door, bringing the ever wakeful Charles to the greatest
  astonishment about who would dare to disturb him at that hour.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Praecepit tamen feminas, quae ad obsequium reginae vel filiarum eum
comitari solebant, ut exirent videre quis esset ad ianuam vel
quid inquireret.
-->
  Nevertheless he ordered the women, who used to accompany him
  to attend the queen or her daughters, to go and see who was at the door
  and what he wanted.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quae exeuntes cognoscentesque personam vilissimam, obseratis ostiis,
cum ingenti risu et cachinno se per angulos vestibus ora repressae
conabantur abscondere.
-->
  They went out and found him to be a very humble person.
  Then, with immoderate laughter and guffawing, they barred the door and
  tried to hide in the corners of the room, covering their mouths with
  their garments.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Sed sagacissimus imperator, quem nihil sub caelo posset
effugere, diligenter a mulieribus exquisivit quid haberent
vel quis ostium pulsaret.
-->
  But the most wise emperor, whose notice nothing under heaven could escape,
  diligently inquired of the women what the matter was,
  or who was beating at the door.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Responsumque accipiens quia quidam coctio derasus, insulsus et
insaniens, lineam tantum et femoralibus indutus, se absque mora
postularet alloqui, iussit eum intromittere.
-->
  And he received the reply that indeed, a knave with a shorn head,
  stupid and acting crazy, barely clothed in a shirt and drawers,
  was ordering them to let him in and demanding to speak with him without delay.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Qui statim corruens ad pedes illius cuncta patefecit ex ordine.
-->
  And he, falling to Charles' feet, at once revealed all that was out of order.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Nihil vero minus suspicantes ante horam diei tertiam omnes illi
coniuratores dignissima poena vel exiliis deportati sunt aut puniti.
-->
  And indeed, suspecting nothing at all, before the third hour of the day
  all those conspirators were transported into exile or punished appropriately.
</p>

<p>END</p>
