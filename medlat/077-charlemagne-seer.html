<h4>Charlesmagne the Seer</h4>

 
<p>START</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Contigit quoque ad quandam maritimam Galliae Narbonensis urbem
vagabundum Karolum inopinato venire.
-->
  It also happened that Charles, in his travels,
  unexpectedly came to a certain coastal city of Narbonese Gaul.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Ad cuius portum, eo prandente sed ignorato,
piraterium exploratores Nordmannorum fecerunt.
-->
  And while he was breakfasting, without notice, at its port,
  Norman scouts conducted a raid.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Cumque, visis navibus, 
alii Iudaeos, alii vero Africanos, alii Britannos mercatores esse dicerent, 
sapientissimus Karolus ex instructione vel agilitate 
non mercatores sed hostes esse deprehendens, dixit ad suos:
"Non istae naves confertae mercimoniis sed hostibus fetae sunt acerrimis."
-->
  And when, after seeing the ships, some said they were Jewish, others African,
  and even others British merchants, the wise Charles,
  recognizing from their construction or their speed
  that they were not merchants but enemies, said:
  "Those ships aren't filled with merchandise, but teeming with bitter enemies."
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
His auditis, alter alterum praevenire cupientes, festine properabant ad naves.
-->
  When they heard this, with each one eager to outrace the others,
  they swiftly hurried to their ships.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Sed frustra.
-->
  But in vain.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Nam comperto Nordmanni quod ibidem esset, 
ut ipsi eum nuncupare solebant, Martellus Karolus,
ne omnis armatura sua in illo aut retunderetur aut in minutissimas resoluta particulas disperiret, 
effugio satis incomparabili insequentium non solum gladios sed et oculos evitarunt.
-->
  For when the Normans discovered that he was at that very place,
  Charles the Hammer, as they were wont to call him,
  for fear that all their weapons be blunted on him, or destroyed,
  shattered into tiny pieces,
  in an unparalleled flight they avoided not only the swords of pursuers but
  even their eyes.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Religiosus autem Karolus, iustus et timoratus, 
exsurgens de mensa ad fenestram orientalem constitit 
et inaestimabilibus lacrimis  diutissime perfusus, 
cum nullus eum compellare praesumeret,
tandem aliquando ipse bellicosissimis proceribus suis de tali gestu et lacrimatione satisfaciens:
-->
  However, Charles, devout, just and God-fearing,
  rising from table stood at the east window
  and for a long time wet with tears beyond all price,
  since no-one dared challenge him.
  Finally he spoke, apologizing to his warlike nobles for such demeanor and tears:
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
"Scitis," inquit, "o fideles mei, quid tantopere ploraverim?
-->
  "Do you know, my loyal men, why I weep so much?
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Non hoc," ait, "timeo quod isti nugae et nihili mihi aliquid nocere praevaleant;
sed nimirum contristor quod me vivente ausi sunt litus istud attingere 
et maximo dolore torqueor quia praevideo quanta mala posteris meis et eorum sunt
facturi subiectis."
-->
  It's not because I fear that those fools and nobodies could do me any harm;
  but I'm deeply saddened that they dared touch that shore while I lived,
  and I'm twisted with a great sorrow, since I foresee such evils
  will happen to my descendents and their subjects.
</p>
