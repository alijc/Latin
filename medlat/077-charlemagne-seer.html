<h4>Charlesmagne the Seer</h4>

<p>
<!--
Contigit quoque ad quandam maritimam Galliae Narbonensis urbem
vagabundum Karolum inopinato venire.
-->
  It also happened that Charles, in his travels,
  unexpectedly came to a certain city on the coast of Narbonese Gaul.

<!--
Ad cuius portum, eo prandente sed ignorato,
piraterium exploratores Nordmannorum fecerunt.
-->
  And while he was breakfasting, incognito, near its port,
  Norman scouts conducted a raid.

<!--
Cumque, visis navibus, 
alii Iudaeos, alii vero Africanos, alii Britannos mercatores esse dicerent, 
sapientissimus Karolus ex instructione vel agilitate 
non mercatores sed hostes esse deprehendens, dixit ad suos:
"Non istae naves confertae mercimoniis sed hostibus fetae sunt acerrimis."
-->
  And after seeing the ships, some said they were Jewish, others African,
  and even others British merchants, but the wise Charles,
  recognizing from their equipment or their speed
  that they were not merchants but enemies, said:
  "Those ships aren't filled with merchandise, but teeming with bitter enemies."
</p>

<p>
<!--
His auditis, alter alterum praevenire cupientes, festine properabant ad naves.
-->
  When they heard this, with each one eager to outrace the others,
  they swiftly hurried to their ships.

<!--
Sed frustra.
-->
  But in vain.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Nam comperto Nordmanni quod ibidem esset, 
ut ipsi eum nuncupare solebant, Martellus Karolus,
ne omnis armatura sua in illo aut retunderetur aut in minutissimas resoluta particulas disperiret, 
effugio satis incomparabili insequentium non solum gladios sed et oculos evitarunt.
-->
  For when the Normans discovered that he was at that very place,
  Charles the Hammer, as they were wont to call him,
  for fear that all their weapons be blunted on him, or destroyed and
  shattered into tiny pieces,
  in an unparalleled flight they escaped not only the swords of their pursuers
  but even their eyes.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Religiosus autem Karolus, iustus et timoratus, 
exsurgens de mensa ad fenestram orientalem constitit 
et inaestimabilibus lacrimis  diutissime perfusus, 
cum nullus eum compellare praesumeret,
tandem aliquando ipse bellicosissimis proceribus suis de tali gestu et lacrimatione satisfaciens:
-->
  But Charles, devout, just and God-fearing,
  rose from table and stood at the east window
  and was for a long time bathed in tears beyond all price,
  and no-one dared to address him.
  Finally he spoke, apologizing to his warlike nobles for such demeanor and tears:
</p>

<p>
<!--
"Scitis," inquit, "o fideles mei, quid tantopere ploraverim?
-->
  "Do you know, my loyal men, why I wept so much?

<!--
Non hoc," ait, "timeo quod isti nugae et nihili mihi aliquid nocere praevaleant;
sed nimirum contristor quod me vivente ausi sunt litus istud attingere 
et maximo dolore torqueor quia praevideo quanta mala posteris meis et eorum sunt
facturi subiectis."
-->
  It's not because I fear that those fools and nobodies could do me any harm;
  but I'm deeply saddened that they dared touch this shore while I lived,
  and I'm tormented with a great sorrow, since I foresee how many evils
  they will do to my descendents and their subjects.
