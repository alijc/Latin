<!--De Philosophorum Libris-->
<h4>On the Writings of the Philosophers</h4>

<p>AJC
<!--
Ecce de septem liberalibus artibus philosophorum, 
ad quam utilitatem discendae sint catholicis, satis, ut reor, superius diximus.
-->
  Look, we have already said enough, I think, about the seven liberal arts of
  the philosophers, and the usefulness which might be learned from them by catholics.

<p>AJC
<!--
Illud adhuc adicimus quod philosophi ipsi qui vocantur, 
si qua forte vera et fidei nostrae accommodata in dispensationibus suis seu scriptis
dixerunt, maxime Platonici, non solum formidanda non sunt sed ab eis
etiam tamquam iniustis possessoribus in usum nostrum vindicanda.
-->
  Besides this we also add that those who are themselves called philosophers,
  if by chance they said anything that is true and suitable to our faith in
  their own systems of philosophy or writings, especially those of Plato, ought
  not be feared but should be claimed for our own use, as if by wrongful owners.

Sicut enim Aegyptii non tantum idola habebant et onera gravia,
quae populus Israel detestaretur et fugeret,
sed etiam vasa et ornamenta de auro et argento et vestem, 
quae ille populus exiens de Aegypto sibi tamquam ad usum meliorem clanculo vindicavit,
non auctoritate propria sed praecepto et mandato,
ipsis Aegyptiis nescienter commodantibus ea quibus ut bonis utebantur.
-->
  For just as the Egyptians had not only idols and grievous errors,
  which the people of Israel cursed and fled,
  but that people left Egypt they still claimed the vessels and trappings of
  gold and silver and the clothing, as if privately putting them to better use
  for themselves, not by their own authority but with a command and mandate,
  with the ignorant Egyptians themselves adapting the things that they
  made good use of.

<!--
Sic doctrinae omnes gentilium non solum simulata
et superstitiosa figmenta gravesque sarcinas supervacanei laboris habent,
quae unusquisque nostrum duce Christo de societate gentilium exiens,
debet abominari atque devitare,
sed etiam liberales disciplinas, de quibus paulo ante egimus,
usui veritatis aptiores et quaedam morum praecepta utilissima continent, 
deque ipso uno Deo colendo nonnulla vera inveniuntur apud eos; 
quod eorum tamquam aurum et argentum, quod non ipsi instituerunt,
sed de quibusdam quasi metallis divinae providentiae, quae ubique infusa est, 
eruerunt et quo perverse et iniuriose ad obsequia daemonum abutuntur, 
cum ab eorum misera societate sese animo separat, 
debet ab eis auferre christianus ad usum iustum praedicandi evangelii.
-->
  Thus all doctrines of pagans have not only counterfeit and
  superstitious fictions and heavy burdens of unnecessary toil,
  which each of us, on leaving the society of pagans, with Christ as our guide,
  ought to avert and to avoid,
  but still, the honorable disciplines that we followed a little while ago
  maintain more suitable lessons and some morally most useful for the use of truth,
  and a few truths were discovered by them about the real single living God;
  and this gold and silver of theirs, they didn't create it,
  but rooted it up as if from some mines of divine providence,
  that had been poured out everywhere,
  and squandered it, both perversely and wrongfully, in obedience to demons,
  as a Christian separated himself from wretched society in his soul,
  a Christion ought to steal this gold from them for the just use of proclaiming the Gospel.
