<!--De Philosophorum Libris-->
<h4>On the Writings of the Philosophers</h4>

<p>
<!--
Ecce de septem liberalibus artibus philosophorum, 
ad quam utilitatem discendae sint catholicis, satis, ut reor, superius diximus.
-->
  Look, we have already said enough, I think, about the seven liberal arts of
  the philosophers, and the usefulness which might be learned from them by catholics.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Illud adhuc adicimus quod philosophi ipsi qui vocantur, 
si qua forte vera et fidei nostrae accommodata in dispensationibus suis seu scriptis
dixerunt, maxime Platonici, non solum formidanda non sunt sed ab eis
etiam tamquam iniustis possessoribus in usum nostrum vindicanda.
-->
  Besides this we also add what those who are themselves called philosophers
  have said,
  if by chance they said anything that is true and suitable to our faith in
  their own systems of philosophy or writings, especially the Platonists, that ought
  not be feared but should be claimed for our own use, as if from wrongful possessors.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Sicut enim Aegyptii non tantum idola habebant et onera gravia,
quae populus Israel detestaretur et fugeret,
sed etiam vasa et ornamenta de auro et argento et vestem, 
quae ille populus exiens de Aegypto sibi tamquam ad usum meliorem clanculo vindicavit,
non auctoritate propria sed praecepto et mandato,
ipsis Aegyptiis nescienter commodantibus ea quibus ut bonis utebantur.
-->
  For just as the Egyptians had not only idols and grievous errors,
  which the people of Israel cursed and fled,
  but also vessels and trappings of gold and silver and clothing that
  that people claimed when leaving Egypt, as if privately putting them to better use
  for themselves, not by their own authority but with a command and mandate,
  with the Egyptians themselves unknowingly providing the things that they
  made good use of.

<!--
Sic doctrinae omnes gentilium non solum simulata
et superstitiosa figmenta gravesque sarcinas supervacanei laboris habent,
quae unusquisque nostrum duce Christo de societate gentilium exiens,
debet abominari atque devitare,
sed etiam liberales disciplinas, de quibus paulo ante egimus,
usui veritatis aptiores et quaedam morum praecepta utilissima continent, 
deque ipso uno Deo colendo nonnulla vera inveniuntur apud eos; 
quod eorum tamquam aurum et argentum, quod non ipsi instituerunt,
sed de quibusdam quasi metallis divinae providentiae, quae ubique infusa est, 
eruerunt et quo perverse et iniuriose ad obsequia daemonum abutuntur, 
cum ab eorum misera societate sese animo separat, 
debet ab eis auferre christianus ad usum iustum praedicandi evangelii.
-->
  Thus all doctrines of pagans have not only counterfeit and
  superstitious fictions and heavy burdens of unnecessary toil,
  which each of us, on leaving the society of pagans, with Christ as our guide,
  ought to avert and to avoid,
  but also honorable disciplines that we dealt with a little while ago, 
  maintain more suitable lessons and some morally most useful for the use of truth,
  and a few truths were discovered in them about the real single living God;
  and this gold and silver of theirs, so to speak, they didn't create it,
  but rooted it up as if from some mines of divine providence,
  that had been poured out everywhere,
  and squandered it, both perversely and wrongfully, in obedience to demons,
  as a Christian separated himself from wretched society in his soul,
  a Christion ought to steal this from them for the just use of proclaiming the Gospel.

<!--
Vestem quoque illorum, id est, hominum quidem instituta, 
sed tamen accommodata humanae societati, 
quibus in hac vita carere non possumus, 
accipere atque habere licuerit in usum convertenda christianum.
-->
  Likewise, it is permitted to take and keep their garments,
  that is, the institutions of men, but is nevertheless fit for 
  civilized society, which we cannot do without in this life,
  to be converted to Christian use.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Nam quid aliud fecerunt boni multi fideles nostri?
-->
  For what else have our many good faithful men done?
</p>

<p>
<!--
Nonne aspicimus quanto auro et argento et veste suffarcinati exierunt de Aegypto
Cyprianus et doctor suavissimus et martyr beatissimus?
-->
  Don't we see how stuffed they were with so much gold and silver and garments
  when they fled Egypt, Cyprian, the pleasant teacher and the blessed martyr?
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quanto Lactantius?
-->
  What about Lactantius?
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quanto Victorinus, Optatus, Hilarius?
-->
  What about Victorinus, Optatus, Hilarius?
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quanto innumerabiles grammatici?
-->
  What about the countless grammarians?
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quod prior ipse fidelissimus Dei famulus Moyses fecerat, 
de quo scriptum est quod "eruditus fuerit omni sapientia Aegyptiorum."
-->
  What Moses himself, the most faithful servant of God, did before that,
  about whom it was written that "he was learned in every wisdom of the Egyptians."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quibus omnibus viris superstitiosa gentium consuetudo et maxime illis temporibus
cum Christi recutiens iugum christianos persequebatur, 
disciplinas quas utiles habebat numquam commodaret, 
si eas in usum colendi unius Dei, quo vanus idolorum cultus exscinderetur, 
conversas suspicaretur.
-->
  And to all these men the superstitious people and especially in those times
  when, rejecting the yoke of Christ, they were persecuting Christians,
  would never have bestowed the teachings that they held as useful,
  had they suspected that they'd be turned to be used in worshiping the one God,
  by whom the false worship of idols might be destroyed.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Sed dederunt aurum et argentum et vestem suam exeunti de Aegypto populo Dei,
 nescientes quemadmodum illa quae dabant in Christi obsequium redderentur.
-->
  But they their gold and silver and clothing to the people of God as they fled
  Egypt, not knowing how what they gave would be turned to Christ's service. 
</p>

<p>
<!--
Illud enim in Exodo factum sine dubio figuratum est ut hoc praesignaret,
 quod sine praeiudicio alterius aut paris aut melioris intellegentiae dixerim.
-->
  For what happened in Exodus without doubt was figuratively to foretell this,
  that without prejudice to another I would call either of equal or better understanding.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Sed hoc modo instructus divinarum scripturarum studiosus, 
cum ad eas scrutandas accedere coeperit, illud apostolicum cogitare non cesset:
 "Scientia inflat, caritas aedificat."
-->
  But a student instructed in this way and studious of divine writings,
  when approaching the works that he means to examine,
  ought not be remiss in pondering that apostolic expression:
  "Knowlege inflates, love creates."
