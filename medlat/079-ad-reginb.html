<h4>To Reginb...</h4>

<p>
<!--
Carissimo suo Reg. Lupus in Domino salutem.
-->
To my dearest Reg..., Lupus sends greetings in the Lord.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Desideramus quidem adventum vestrum, ut dignum est, 
quem iam certae litterae spoponderunt; 
sed suademus vigilantissima cautione tutum iter eligendum,
propterea quod in regno Caroli regis nostri, novis exortis rebus, 
impune latrocinia committuntur, 
et nihil securius atque constantius quam rapinarum violentia frequentatur.
-->
  As is fit, we certainly long for your arrival,
  which certain letters have already promised;
  but we urge that a prudent route be chosen with a watchful care,
  because with the uprisings in the realm of our King Charles,
  robberies are committed with impunity,
  and nothing is happening more surely or constantly than
  the violence of robberies.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Talis igitur est commeantium quaerenda societas quorum numero atque virtute
improborum factio evitetur, aut si necesse fuerit repellatur.
-->
  Therefore, a fellowship of travelers must needs be sought,
  by whose size and strength a party of robbers is avoided,
  or, if needs must, is driven off.
</p>

<p>
<!--
"Catilinarium" et "Iugurthinum" Sallusti librosque "Verrinarum,"
et si quos alios vel corruptos nos habere vel penitus non habere cognoscitis, 
nobis adferre dignemini, 
ut vestro beneficio et vitiosi corrigantur et non habiti,
numquamque nisi per vos habendi, hoc gratius quo insperatius adquirantur.
-->
  I pray that you condescend to bring us Sallust's "Catiline Conspiracy" and
  "Jugurthine War" and the books "Against Verres"
  and any others that you are aware of,
  either that we have that are damaged or that we don't have at all,
  so that, by your kindness, both the faulty ones may be corrected
  and the missing ones, that would never be had except through you,
  obtained with greater pleasure by being unexpected.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Cupio vos valere feliciter.
-->
  I wish you to be healthy and happy.
