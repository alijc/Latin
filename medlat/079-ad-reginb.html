<h4>To Reginb...</h4>

<p>AJC
<!--
Carissimo suo Reg. Lupus in Domino salutem.
-->
To my dearest Reg..., Lupus sends greetings in the Lord.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Desideramus quidem adventum vestrum, ut dignum est, 
quem iam certae litterae spoponderunt; 
sed suademus vigilantissima cautione tutum iter eligendum,
propterea quod in regno Caroli regis nostri, novis exortis rebus, 
impune latrocinia committuntur, 
et nihil securius atque constantius quam rapinarum violentia frequentatur.
-->
  As is fit, we certainly long for your arrival,
  which certain letters have already promised;
  but we urge that a prudent route be chosen with a watchful care,
  because in the realm of our King Charles, with new things rising,
  robberies are committed with impunity,
  and there is nothing surer or more constant than that
  the violence of robberies is happening more often.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Talis igitur est commeantium quaerenda societas quorum numero atque virtute
improborum factio evitetur, aut si necesse fuerit repellatur.
-->
  Therefore, for such a visitation a fellowship must needs be sought,
  by whose size and strength a party of robbers is avoided,
  or, if needs must, is driven off.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
"Catilinarium" et "Iugurthinum" Sallusti librosque "Verrinarum,"
et si quos alios vel corruptos nos habere vel penitus non habere cognoscitis, 
nobis adferre dignemini, 
ut vestro beneficio et vitiosi corrigantur et non habiti,
numquamque nisi per vos habendi, hoc gratius quo insperatius adquirantur.
-->
  I pray that you condescend to bring us Sallust's "Catiline Conspiracy" and
  "Jugurthine War" and the books "Against Verres"
  and any others that you are aware of,
  either that we have that are damaged or that we don't have at all,
  to set right, by your kindness, both the faulty and the missing ones,
  and never to be had except through you,
  they are obtained here more pleasantly by which more unexpectedly.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Cupio vos valere feliciter.
-->
  I wish that you'll be healthy and happy.
</p>
