<!--AD ALTSIGUM ABBATEM-->
<h4>To Abbot Altsig</h4>

<p>
<!--
Venerabili Altsigo abbati Lupus monasterii Bethlehemitici sive Ferrariensis in Domino salutem. 
-->
  Lupus, of the monastery of Bethlehem or Ferri√®res, greets the venerable Abbot
  Altsig in the Lord.

<!--
Ingenti clementia Dei nostri discordiae peste mitigata,
quae totas Gallias Germaniamque hactenus vexavit atrociter, 
inter ipsa pacis exordia foedus
quod inter nostram vestramque olim fuit ecclesiam, 
directis ad reverentissimum Guigmundum episcopum litteris, studui renovare.
-->
  Since, by the vast mercy of our God, the destruction of the discord,
  which violently shook all Gaul and Germany up til now, has eased,
  I desire to renew, during these very beginnings of peace,
  the bond that once was between my church and yours,
  with a letter directed to your most reverent Bishop Guigmund.

<!--
Quia vero vos amore sapientiae, cuius et ego sum avidus, flagrare comperi,
vel secundum illud Tullii, "pares ad pares facile congregantur," 
et iuxta receptae scripturae assertionem, 
"omne animal diligit sibi simile, sic omnis homo," 
hac epistola meam offero et vestram expeto amicitiam ut nobis vicissim, 
cum in sacris orationibus, tum etiam in quibuslibet aliis utilitatibus, 
prodesse curemus. 
-->
  Since I learned that you truly burn with a love of wisdom,
  for which I too am ardent,
  let us undertake to benefit from either the saying of Cicero,
  "birds of a feather flock together",
  or equally the assertion of accepted scripture,
  "every living thing values its like, so does every man".
  With this letter I offer my friendship and  desire yours in turn,
  not only in holy prayer, but also in any other advantages as well.

Atque ut quod polliceor vos exsequamini priores, 
obnixe flagito ut "Quaestiones" beati Hieronymi quas, teste Cassiodoro, 
in Vetus et Novum Testamentum elaboravit, 
Bedae quoque vestri similiter "Quaestiones" in utrumque Testamentum, 
item memorati Hieronymi libros "Explanationum in Hieremiam," praeter sex primos,
qui apud nos reperiuntur, ceteros qui sequuntur; 
praeterea Quintiliani "Institutionum" oratoriarum libros XII 
per certissimos nuntios mihi ad cellam Sancti Iudoci, 
quae tandem aliquando nobis reddita est, dirigatis tradendos Lantramno, 
qui bene vobis notus est, ibique exscribendos, 
vobisque quam poterit fieri celerius remittendos. 
-->
  And so that you may be first to follow what I propose,
  I resolutely entreat you to send the blessed Jerome's "Inquiries", in which,
  according to Cassiodorus, he elaborated the Old and New Testaments,
  also similarly your Bede's "Inquiries" on both Testaments,
  likewise the memorable Jerome's books "Commentaries on Jeremiah",
  except the first six, which are found here with us, the rest which follow;
  in addition Quintilius' 12 books "Institutions of Orations".
  Send them by means of sure messengers to me at the priory of Saint Josse,
  which has finally been restored to us. You may direct them to be delivered
  to Lantramn, who is well known to you, and to be copied,
  and then returned to you as quickly as possible.

<!--
Quod si omnes non potueritis, at aliquos ne gravemini destinare, 
recepturi a Deo praemium impletae caritatis, 
a nobis autem quamcumque possibilem dumtaxat iusseritis vicem tanti laboris.
-->
  But if you cannot send them all, don't hesitate to send some of them.
  You are sure to receive a reward from God for the kindness that you will have done,
  and from us whatever is possible that you might request in return for such toil.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Valete, nosque mox ut se oportunitas obtulerit exoptabili responso laetificate.
-->
  Farewell, and cheer us with the desired reply as soon as
  the opportunity presents itself.
