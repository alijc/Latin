<!--AD HINCMARUM-->
<h4>To Hincmarus</h4>


<p>AJC
<!--
Clarissimo praesuli Hincmaro Lupus perpetuam salutem.
-->
  To the most illustrious Bishop Hincmarus, Lupus wishes eternal salvation.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Collectaneum Bedae in apostolum ex operibus Augustini veritus sum dirigere, 
propterea quod tantus est liber ut nec sinu celari, 
nec pera possit satis commode contineri; 
quamquam, si alterutrum fieret, formidanda esset obvia improborum rapacitas, 
quam profecto pulchritudo ipsius codicis accendisset, 
et ita forsitan et mihi et vobis perisset. 
-->
  I was afraid to direct Bede's commentary on the apostle from Augustine's works,
  because the book is so large that it can neither be concealed in one's bosom,
  nor can it be comfortably contained in a sachel;
  although, if either happened, one must fear the hostile rapacity of brigands,
  that the beauty of the codex itself would assuredly arouse,
  and so perhaps it would be destroyed both for me and for you.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Proinde tuto vobis memoratum volumen ipse commodaturus sum cum primo si Deus vult, aliquo nos contigerit sospites convenire. 
-->
  Hence I myself mean to safely lend you the recounted volume
  as soon as, God willing, we may safely meet somewhere.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Pineas autem nuces, quot cursor ferre potuit, hoc est decem, mittendas curavi. 
-->
  Now I have undertaken to send as many pine nuts as the courier can take,
  which is ten.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Rescriptum vestrum quo notarii, ut scripsistis, me privavit impedimentum, 
cursor idem noster ad hoc directus ut a vobis propositum est, accipiat, 
ut lectione illius vel erudiar vel delecter. 
-->
  Let our same courier, directed for this, as was proposed by you, recieve
  your reply, as soon as you write it, it freed me of an impediment,
  so that in reading it I might be either instructed or amused.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Benigne vos mei memores opto valere feliciter.
-->
  May you kindly remember me I wish to fare happily.
</p>

<p>END</p>
