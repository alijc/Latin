<h4>A MEDIEVAL NEWS RECORD</h4>

<p>
<!--
752. Passus est sanctus pater noster Bonifatius, 
vir apostolicus et omni sapientia adornatus, 
qui de Anglorum gente nobilem ducens originem ibidem in sancto proposito religiosissime educatus,
et doctrina nihilominus insignis fuit et miraculis claruit;
postea vero divina admonitus pietate Germaniae fines adiit,
Francorum gentem diversis errorum laqueis irretitam nobiliter instruxit et haereticorum pravitates instantissime superavit.
-->
  752. Our holy father Boniface suffered martyrdom.
  He was an apostolic man endowed with every wisdom,
  who, drawing his noble birth from the English nation,
  was most piously educated in holy purpose in that same place,
  and was nonetheless conspicuous in learning and gained fame for miracles.
  Afterwards truly urged by divine piety he came to the lands of Germany.
  He splendidly instructed the Frankish nation, who were entangled in a web of errors,
  and ruthlessly overcame the errors of their herectics.

<!--
Evangelica etiam doctrina adeo praecipuus exstitit ut apostolorum tempora in eius praedicatione laudares.
-->
  He also especially stood out in evangelical teaching to such a degree
  that you might call upon the times of the apostles in his preaching.

<p>
<!--
Itaque meritis illius circumquaque clarescentibus, 
a viro sanctissimo Gregorio papa Romano accersitus, 
ad illuminationem totius Germaniae transmissus et ab eodem episcopus ordinatus,
in civitate quae Mogontia dicitur pontificatus honore meruit sublimari.
-->
  And so, with his merits evident on every side,
  he was summoned by the very holy Gregory, the pope of Rome,
  sent for the enlightmentment of all of Germany and ordained as bishop by him
  in the city called Mayence;
  he deserved to be elevated by the honor of the pontificate.

<!--
Ibi inter homines constitutus, angelicam vitam exercuit, 
Francorum gentem, Thuringorum et Saxonum populos Deo adquisivit, 
et in omni sanctitate gloriosus fuit.
-->
  Set up among the men there, he exercised an angelic life,
  he won the Frankish nation, and the Thuringian and Saxon peoples to God,
  and was filled with glory in all sanctity.

<!--
Novissime ergo cum multos ex Frisonibus christianae religioni subiugasset, 
a paganis qui supererant gladio peremptus, 
cum martyrii gloria migravit ad caelestia regna
corpusque illius comitante fidelium maxima turba ad Fuldense monasterium,
quod ipse sibi in solitudine Boconia construxerat, 
cum magnis Dei laudibus transportatum et condigno honore tumulatum,
miraculis ibidem plurimis claret.
-->
  And so, since he had very recently brought many of the Frisians under
  the yoke of Christianity,
  he was killed by the sword by those who remained pagan.
  He went to the heavenly kingdom with a martyr's glory
  and with a great crowd of the faithful accompanying his corpse to the 
  monastery of Fulda,
  which he had constructed for himself in the Boconian wilderness.
  He was carried across with great praises to God and interred with befitting honor,
  and he is renowned for many miracles in that very place.

<!--
Passi sunt autem cum eo et alii ex clero eius viri religiosi, presbyteri, diacones et monachi, 
sed nobiliores inter eos fuerunt Eobanus episcopus et Adalarius sacerdos, 
qui primitus in monasterio quod Trech nominatur honorabilem meruerunt sepulturam
sed emergentibus annis etiam ipsi Fuldam translati, 
iuxta corpus sancti pastoris sui Bonifatii satis pulcherrime requiescunt.
-->
  Now others of his clergy were also martyred with him -
  religious men, presbyters, deacons, and monks,
  and the nobler ones among them were Bishop Eobanus and Father Adalarius,
  who first earned honorable graves in the monastery called Trech
  but in later years now were themselves translated to Fulda.
  They rest quite beautifully near the corpse of their holy shepherd Boniface.
