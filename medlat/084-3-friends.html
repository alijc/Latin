<h4>The Three Friends</h4>

<p>
<!--
De Notkero, Ratperto, Tuotilone, quoniam quidem cor et anima una
erant, qualia tres quasi unus fecerint, quantum a patribus audivimus,
narrare incipimus.
-->
  Because they were indeed of a single heart and soul,
  acting as if all three were a single man,
  we undertake to tell of Notker, Ratpert, and Tuotilo -
  as much as we've heard from our fathers,
</p>

<p>
<!--
Hi tres, quamvis votis essent unicordes, natura tamen, ut fit, erant dissimiles.
-->
  These three, as much as they were in harmony in their vows,
  yet in character were, as it happens, not at all alike.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Notker corpore non animo gracilis, voce non spiritu balbulus, in
divinis erectus, in adversis patiens, ad omnia mitis, in nostratium acer
erat exactor disciplinis; ad repentina timidulus et inopinata, praeter
daemones infestantes, erat; quibus quidem se audenter opponere solebat.
-->
  Notker was frail in body but not in mind, stuttering in voice but not in
  spirit, upright in divinity, patient in adversity, gentle to all,
  a strict enforcer of discipline among the brothers.
  He was somewhat timid at unexpected and unforeseen events,
  except for vexing demons.
  Indeed, he was wont to boldly set himself in opposition to them.
</p>

<p>
<!--
In orando, legendo, dictando creberrimus.
-->
  He was constantly praying, reading, and writing verse.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Et ut omnes sanctitatis eius in brevi complectar dotes, 
sancti spiritus erat vasculum, quo suo tempore abundantius nullum.
-->
  And so that I might briefly encompass all the qualities of his sanctity,
  he was a vessel of the Holy Spirit, filled as fully as anyone else in his time.
</p>

<p>
<!--
At Tuotilo longe aliter bonus erat et utilis.
-->
  Tuotilo was good and useful, but in a vastly different way.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Homo lacertis et omnibus membris sicut Fabius athletas eligere docet;
erat eloquens, voce clarus, caelaturae elegans et picturae artifex,
musicus sicut socii eius; sed in omnium genere fidium et fistularum prae
omnibus.
-->
  In his shoulders and all his limbs,
  he was just such a man as Fabius teaches us to choose as athletes.
  He was eloquent, his voice clear, his carving elegant and his paintings artful,
  his music just as his companions - but above all in all varieties of harps and pipes.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Nam et filios nobilium in loco ab abbate destinato fidibus edocuit.
-->
  For he also taught the harp to nobles' sons,
  who had been selected by the abbot of the place.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Nuntius procul et prope sollers; in structuris et ceteris artibus
suis efficax, concinnandi in utraque lingua potens et promptus natura,
serio et ioco festivus, adeo ut Karolus noster aliquando ei maledixerit
qui talis naturae hominem monachum fecerit.
-->
  A skilled envoy for far and near; effective in building and other skills,
  capable of expessing himself in two languages and prompt by nature,
  witty in earnest and in jest, to the point that our emperor Charles
  sometimes cursed the man who had made a man of such a nature into a monk.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Sed inter haec omnia, quod prae aliis est, in choro strenuus, in
latebris erat lacrimosus; versus et melodias facere praepotens; castus,
ut Marcelli discipulus, qui feminis oculos clausit.
-->
  But among all these things is what is before the rest,
  he was vigorous in choir, and tearful in secret;
  quite capable of creating verses and melodies;
  and chaste as became a disciple of Marcellus, who shut his eyes to women.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Ratpertus autem inter ambos quos diximus medius incedebat.
-->
  But Ratpert walked midway between the two that we've spoken of.

<!--
Scholarum ab adulescentia magister, doctor planus et benevolus, disciplinis asperior;
raro praeter fratres pedem claustro promovens, duos calceos annum habens, excursus mortem nominans; 
saepe Tuotilonem itinerarium ut se caveret amplexibus monens.
-->
  A schoolmaster from his youth, a clear and benevolent teacher,
  rather stern in discipline;
  the brother who went outside the monastery most rarely,
  having two shoes a year, calling it death to leave the monastery;
  oftimes warning Tuotilo, who was given to travel, to beware of embraces.

<!--
In scholis sedulus, plerumque cursus et missas neglegebat,
"bonas," inquiens, "missas audimus cum eas agi docemus."
-->
  Painstaking in classes, he neglected most of the services and masses,
  saying, "We hear good masses when we teach how to celebrate them."

<!--
Qui cum labem maximam claustri impunitatem nominasset,
ad capitulum tamen nonnisi vocatus venit, 
cum sibi officium capitulandi et puniendi gravissimum, ut ait, sit traditum.
-->
  And although he'd called freedom from punishment the greatest fault of the monastery,
  nevertheless he didn't go to chapter unless summoned, since, as he said,
  the obligation of meeting and punishing given to him  was heavy enough.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Tales cum essent tres isti nostrae rei publicae senatores - 
quod semper doctorum est et utilium - 
ab otio vacantibus et in levitate ambulantibus detractiones 
et dorsiloquia patiuntur assidua; 
sed maxime, quia minus refellere solebat, sanctus, ut vere asseram, domnus Notkerus.
-->
  Since such were these three senators of our republic 
  they suffered constant slanders and backbiting
  from those given to idleness and from those who walk in levity
  - which is always the lot of the learned and helpful.
  But, since he was less wont to refute them,
  the sainted (as I may indeed assert) Master Notker especially suffered.

<!--
Tuotilo quidem et Ratpertus acriores talibus minusque ad contumelias habiles,
rarius ab eis laedebantur; 
Notkerus autem, hominum mitissimus, quid iniuriae essent in semetipso didicit.
-->
  Indeed, Tuotilo and Ratpert, sharper in such things and less fit for insults,
  were more rarely annoyed by them;
  but Notker, a very meek man, took the injustices to himself to heart.
</p>

<p>
<!--
De quibus pluribus unum aliquem,
ut quantum Satanas in talibus praesumat ab uno discas omnes introducere volumus.
-->
  And apart from these many man we wish to introduce one more,
  so that you might learn everything from one,
  however much Satan might presume in such men.

<!--
Erat hic quidem refectorarius nomine Sindolfus, postremo autem fictis obsequelis,
cum alias in nullo esset utilis, accusans fratres criminibus coniectis, 
a Salomone operariorum positus est decanus.
-->
  There was a certain refectorer by the name of Sindolfus,
  and in the end, through feigned obsequiousness,
  since he was not at all useful otherwise,
  accusing the brothers of crimes that he could only guess at,
  SÐ°lomon made him workmaster.

<!--
Enimvero cum esset refectorarius pro commodis incommoda,
quibus ausus erat, exhibebat; prae ceteris autem Notkero.
-->
  What is more, since he was refectorer,
  he presented injuries, in the place of benefits,
  to whomever he intended; and to Notker more than the others.

<!--
Salomone autem in plurimis occupato nec adtendere ad singula sufficienti, 
alimonia interdum fratribus cum aut detraheretur aut depravaretur, 
clamabant plures pro iniustitia;
inter quos aliquando etiam tres quos dicimus isti aliqua locuti parebant.
-->
  Now with Salomon busy with many things and unable to pay attention to details,
  the brothers' food was sometimes either withheld or tainted,
  and many cried out against the injustice when this happened;
  and it somehow appeared to him that the three of whom we speak 
  had also been among those who had spoken.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Erat tribus illis inseparabilibus consuetudo permisso quidem prioris
in intervallo laudum nocturno convenire in scriptorio collationesque
tali horae aptissimas de scripturis facere.
-->
  Indeed, the prior customarily gave these three inseparables permission
  to meet up in the scriptorium between the night and morning services and
  use that hour to copy out corrections from the scriptures.

<!--
At Sindolfus, sciens horam et colloquia,
quadam nocte fenestrae vitreae cui Tuotilo assederat, 
clandestino foris appropiat, aureque vitro affixa, 
si quid rapere posset quod depravatum episcopo traderet auscultabat.
-->
  But Sindolfus, knowing the hour and the meeting,
  one night snuck up to the glass window that Tuotilo was sitting by,
  and, with his ear fixed to the glass,
  listened for anything that he could distort and relate to the bishop. 

<!--
Senserat illum Tuotilo, homo pervicax lacertisque confisus, 
latialiterque, quo illum qui nihil intellegeret lateret, compares alloquitur.
-->
  Tuotilo, a man steadfast and confident in his strength, caught sight of him
  and spoke to his fellows in Latin, which the hiding man didn't understand.
</p>

<p>
<!--
"Adest ille," inquit, "et aurem fenestrae affixit.
-->
  "He is here," he said, "and has fixed his ear to the window.

<!--
Sed tu, Notker, quia timidulus es, cede in ecclesiam, Ratperte autem mi,
rapto flagello fratrum, quod pendet in pyrali, deforis accurre.
-->
  Now you, Notker, since you are somewhat timid, withdraw into the church,
  while you Ratpert, my friend, get the brotherhood's whip
  that hangs in the chapter hall, and hurry back here.

<!--
Ego enim illum, cum appropinquare te sensero, vitro citissime redaperto, 
captum capillis ad meque pertractum violenter tenebo.
-->
  For, when I see you are close, I'll quickly open the window and grab him
  by the hair and yank him through the window towards me, and hang on to him.

<!--
Tu autem, anime mi, confortare et esto robustus,
flagelloque illum totis viribus increpita, et Deum in illo ulciscere."
-->
  But you, dear heart, take courage and be strong,
  and rebuke him with the whip with all your strength,
  and put the fear of God in him."
</p>
 
<p>START</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Ille vero, sicut semper erat ad disciplinas acutissimus, modeste exiens,
rapto flagello, cucurrit celerrimus, hominemque intra capite tractum, 
totis viribus a dorso ingradinat.
-->
  Indeed, he, who was always the sharpest at classes, obediently left
  to snatch up the whip and came running ever so swiftly,
  and with all his strength beat the man being held by the head from inside.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Et ecce ille manibus pedibusque renisus, flagellum incussum capiens tenuit; 
at ille virgam propius aspectam rapiens, ictus ei validissimos infregit.
-->
  And look! He held, struggling hand and foot, seizing whip having been struck;
  but he seizing the switch nearly having been seen, most powerful blows to him
  overcame. 
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Cum autem parci sibi, male iam mulctatus, in cassum petisset:
"Voce," inquit, "opus est," et exclamans vociferavit.
-->
  But when of sparing to self, badly already punished, in vain he begged:
  "toby voice", he said, "it is well," and exclaiming cried out.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
At fratrum pars, voce audita tali tempore insolita, 
stupens accurrit luminibus et quidnam esset quaesivit.
-->
  But some of the brothers, not used to hearing a voice at such a time,
  rushed up with lamps, astounded, and asked what the heck was going on.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Tuotilo autem diabolum se cepisse creber ingeminans, 
lumen adhiberi rogat ut in cuius ilium imagine teneret certius inspiceret.
-->
  But Tuotilo, repeating that he had seized the devil,
  asked for a lamp to be brought so he could use its light to examine
  whatever it was that he held so firmly.
</p> 

<p>AJC
<!--
Capite autem inviti hac et illac ad inspicientes versato, 
si Sindolfus esset quasi nescius interrogat.
-->
  But, turning his unwilling head this way and that to inspect it,
  he asked questions as if unaware that it was Sindolfus.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Omnibus autem vere ipsum esse clamantibus et ut illum dimitteret rogantibus, 
relicto eo: 
"Me miserum," ait, "in auricularem et intimum episcopi manus misisse."
-->
  But with everyone crying out that this truly was he,
  and praying that he let him go, he released him:
  "Dear me," he said, "to have laid hands on the bishop's counselor and
  confidante."
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Ratpertus vero, fratribus accurrentibus, in partem cedens clam se subduxit.
-->
  Indeed, when the brothers came running, Ratpert secretly  withdrew to the side
  and carried himself away.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Neque enim ipse qui passus est a quo caederetur scire poterat.
-->
  For he himself couldn't know who had suffered and by whom he had been struck.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quaerentibus autem aliquibus ubinam domnus Notkerus Ratpertusque abissent: 
"Ambo," inquit, "ad opus Dei, diabolum sentientes, abierunt,
meque cum illo in negotio perambulante in tenebris dimiserunt.
-->
  For anyone searching anywhere masters Notker and Ratpert were not to be found:
  "Both," he said, "left, after seeing that it was the devil, for God's work,
  and they sent me away with him prowling in distress in the shadows.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Vere autem omnes scitote angelum Domini ictus ei manu sua incussisse."
-->
  But really, you all must understand that an angel of the Lord struck
  him with its own hand."
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Discedentibus tandem fratribus, a partium sectatoribus surgunt, ut fit, multiloquia;
alii Dei iudicio, ut auscultatores clandestini publicarentur factum dicebant;
alii autem tali viro, nisi quod angelum Dei praetendit, tale opus non decuisse.
-->
  In the end, with the brothers going off, there rose, as was natural,
  lively discussions from those following it of sides;
  some called it the judgment of God, that eavedroppers should be exposed;
  while others said that such work by such a man wouldn't have been proper,
  had he not had an angel of God as his defense.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Occultabat autem se confractus ille corporis pariter et mentis dolore.
-->
  But he, broken and in pain, in body and mind both, hid.
</p>

<p>END</p>
