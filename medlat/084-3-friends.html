<h4>The Three Friends</h4>
 
<p>START</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
De Notkero, Ratperto, Tuotilone, quoniam quidem cor et anima una
erant, qualia tres quasi unus fecerint, quantum a patribus audivimus,
narrare incipimus.
-->
  We undertake to tell of Notker, Ratpert, and Tuotilo,
  because we have heard so much from the fathers,
  that they were of a single heart and soul, as if they were three in one.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Hi tres, quamvis votis essent unicordes, natura tamen, ut fit, erant dissimiles.
-->
  These three, however they might be in harmony in their vows,
  yet their natures were, as it happens, not similar.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Notker corpore non animo gracilis, voce non spiritu balbulus, in
divinis erectus, in adversis patiens, ad omnia mitis, in nostratium acer
erat exactor disciplinis; ad repentina timidulus et inopinata, praeter
daemones infestantes, erat; quibus quidem se audenter opponere solebat.
-->
  Notker was frail in body but not in mind, stuttering in voice but not in
  spirit, upright in divinity, patient in adversity, gentle to all,
  a strict enforcer of discipline among the brothers.
  He was somewhat timid at unexpected and unforeseen events,
  except for vexing demons.
  Indeed, he was wont to boldly set himself in opposition to them.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
In orando, legendo, dictando creberrimus.
-->
  He was constantly praying, reading, and writing verse.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Et ut omnes sanctitatis eius in brevi complectar dotes, 
sancti spiritus erat vasculum, quo suo tempore abundantius nullum.
-->
  And so that I might briefly embrace all the qualities of his sanctity,
  he was a vessel of the Holy Spirit, in which nothing was more abundant in his time.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
At Tuotilo longe aliter bonus erat et utilis.
-->
  Tuotilo was good and useful, but far differently.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Homo lacertis et omnibus membris sicut Fabius athletas eligere docet;
erat eloquens, voce clarus, caelaturae elegans et picturae artifex,
musicus sicut socii eius; sed in omnium genere fidium et fistularum prae
omnibus.
-->
  In his shoulders and all his limbs, he was just such a man as Fabius
  teaches us to choose as athletes.
  He was eloquent, his voice clear, his carving elegant and his paintings artful,
  his music like his companions - but above all in all varieties of harps and pipes.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Nam et filios nobilium in loco ab abbate destinato fidibus edocuit.
-->
  For he even taught the harp to sons of nobles determined in the place by the abbot.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Nuntius procul et prope sollers; in structuris et ceteris artibus
suis efficax, concinnandi in utraque lingua potens et promptus natura,
serio et ioco festivus, adeo ut Karolus noster aliquando ei maledixerit
qui talis naturae hominem monachum fecerit.
-->
  A skilled envoy for far and near; effectove in building and other skills,
  capable of expessing himself in two languages and prompt by nature,
  witty in earnest and in jest, to the point that our emperor Charles
  sometimes cursed the man who had made a man of such a nature into a monk.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Sed inter haec omnia, quod prae aliis est, in choro strenuus, in
latebris erat lacrimosus; versus et melodias facere praepotens; castus,
ut Marcelli discipulus, qui feminis oculos clausit.
-->
  But among all these things, which is before all others, he was vigorous in
  choir, and tearful in secret;
  quite capable of creating verses and melodies;
  chaste as bacame a disciple of Marcellus, who shut his eyes to women.
