<h4>The Three Friends</h4>
 
<p>START</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
De Notkero, Ratperto, Tuotilone, quoniam quidem cor et anima una
erant, qualia tres quasi unus fecerint, quantum a patribus audivimus,
narrare incipimus.
-->
  Because we have heard so much from the fathers,
  we undertake to tell of Notker, Ratpert, and Tuotilo -
  they were of a single heart and soul, as if they were three in one.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Hi tres, quamvis votis essent unicordes, natura tamen, ut fit, erant dissimiles.
-->
  These three, as much as they were in harmony in their vows,
  yet in nature were, as it happens, not at all alike.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Notker corpore non animo gracilis, voce non spiritu balbulus, in
divinis erectus, in adversis patiens, ad omnia mitis, in nostratium acer
erat exactor disciplinis; ad repentina timidulus et inopinata, praeter
daemones infestantes, erat; quibus quidem se audenter opponere solebat.
-->
  Notker was frail in body but not in mind, stuttering in voice but not in
  spirit, upright in divinity, patient in adversity, gentle to all,
  a strict enforcer of discipline among the brothers.
  He was somewhat timid at unexpected and unforeseen events,
  except for vexing demons.
  Indeed, he was wont to boldly set himself in opposition to them.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
In orando, legendo, dictando creberrimus.
-->
  He was constantly praying, reading, and writing verse.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Et ut omnes sanctitatis eius in brevi complectar dotes, 
sancti spiritus erat vasculum, quo suo tempore abundantius nullum.
-->
  And so that I might briefly encompass all the qualities of his sanctity,
  he was a vessel of the Holy Spirit, filled as fully as anyone else in his time.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
At Tuotilo longe aliter bonus erat et utilis.
-->
  Tuotilo was good and useful, but in different ways.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Homo lacertis et omnibus membris sicut Fabius athletas eligere docet;
erat eloquens, voce clarus, caelaturae elegans et picturae artifex,
musicus sicut socii eius; sed in omnium genere fidium et fistularum prae
omnibus.
-->
  In his shoulders and all his limbs,
  he was just such a man as Fabius teaches us to choose as athletes.
  He was eloquent, his voice clear, his carving elegant and his paintings artful,
  his music just as his companions - but above all in all varieties of harps and pipes.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Nam et filios nobilium in loco ab abbate destinato fidibus edocuit.
-->
  For he also taught the harp to nobles' sons,
  who had been selected by the abbot of the place.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Nuntius procul et prope sollers; in structuris et ceteris artibus
suis efficax, concinnandi in utraque lingua potens et promptus natura,
serio et ioco festivus, adeo ut Karolus noster aliquando ei maledixerit
qui talis naturae hominem monachum fecerit.
-->
  A skilled envoy for far and near; effective in building and other skills,
  capable of expessing himself in two languages and prompt by nature,
  witty in earnest and in jest, to the point that our emperor Charles
  sometimes cursed the man who had made a man of such a nature into a monk.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Sed inter haec omnia, quod prae aliis est, in choro strenuus, in
latebris erat lacrimosus; versus et melodias facere praepotens; castus,
ut Marcelli discipulus, qui feminis oculos clausit.
-->
  But among all these things is what is before the rest,
  he was vigorous in choir, and tearful in secret;
  quite capable of creating verses and melodies;
  and chaste as became a disciple of Marcellus, who shut his eyes to women.
