<h4>The Three Friends</h4>

<p>
<!--
De Notkero, Ratperto, Tuotilone, quoniam quidem cor et anima una
erant, qualia tres quasi unus fecerint, quantum a patribus audivimus,
narrare incipimus.
-->
  Because they were indeed of a single heart and soul,
  acting as if all three were a single man,
  we undertake to tell of Notker, Ratpert, and Tuotilo -
  as much as we've heard from our fathers,
</p>

<p>
<!--
Hi tres, quamvis votis essent unicordes, natura tamen, ut fit, erant dissimiles.
-->
  These three, as much as they were in harmony in their vows,
  yet in character were, as it happens, not at all alike.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Notker corpore non animo gracilis, voce non spiritu balbulus, in
divinis erectus, in adversis patiens, ad omnia mitis, in nostratium acer
erat exactor disciplinis; ad repentina timidulus et inopinata, praeter
daemones infestantes, erat; quibus quidem se audenter opponere solebat.
-->
  Notker was frail in body but not in mind, stuttering in voice but not in
  spirit, upright in divinity, patient in adversity, gentle to all,
  a strict enforcer of discipline among the brothers.
  He was somewhat timid at unexpected and unforeseen events,
  except for vexing demons.
  Indeed, he was wont to boldly set himself in opposition to them.
</p>

<p>
<!--
In orando, legendo, dictando creberrimus.
-->
  He was constantly praying, reading, and writing verse.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Et ut omnes sanctitatis eius in brevi complectar dotes, 
sancti spiritus erat vasculum, quo suo tempore abundantius nullum.
-->
  And so that I might briefly encompass all the qualities of his sanctity,
  he was a vessel of the Holy Spirit, filled as fully as anyone else in his time.
</p>

<p>
<!--
At Tuotilo longe aliter bonus erat et utilis.
-->
  Tuotilo was good and useful, but in a vastly different way.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Homo lacertis et omnibus membris sicut Fabius athletas eligere docet;
erat eloquens, voce clarus, caelaturae elegans et picturae artifex,
musicus sicut socii eius; sed in omnium genere fidium et fistularum prae
omnibus.
-->
  In his shoulders and all his limbs,
  he was just such a man as Fabius teaches us to choose as athletes.
  He was eloquent, his voice clear, his carving elegant and his paintings artful,
  his music just as his companions - but above all in all varieties of harps and pipes.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Nam et filios nobilium in loco ab abbate destinato fidibus edocuit.
-->
  For he also taught the harp to nobles' sons,
  who had been selected by the abbot of the place.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Nuntius procul et prope sollers; in structuris et ceteris artibus
suis efficax, concinnandi in utraque lingua potens et promptus natura,
serio et ioco festivus, adeo ut Karolus noster aliquando ei maledixerit
qui talis naturae hominem monachum fecerit.
-->
  A skilled envoy for far and near; effective in building and other skills,
  capable of expessing himself in two languages and prompt by nature,
  witty in earnest and in jest, to the point that our emperor Charles
  sometimes cursed the man who had made a man of such a nature into a monk.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Sed inter haec omnia, quod prae aliis est, in choro strenuus, in
latebris erat lacrimosus; versus et melodias facere praepotens; castus,
ut Marcelli discipulus, qui feminis oculos clausit.
-->
  But among all these things is what is before the rest,
  he was vigorous in choir, and tearful in secret;
  quite capable of creating verses and melodies;
  and chaste as became a disciple of Marcellus, who shut his eyes to women.
</p>

<!--
Ratpertus autem inter ambos quos diximus medius incedebat.
-->
  But Ratpert walked midway between the two that we've spoken of.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Scholarum ab adulescentia magister, doctor planus et benevolus, disciplinis asperior;
raro praeter fratres pedem claustro promovens, duos calceos annum habens, excursus mortem nominans; 
saepe Tuotilonem itinerarium ut se caveret amplexibus monens.
-->
  A master of scholars from his youth,
  a clear and benevolent teacher,
  rather stern in discipline;
  the brother who went outside the monastery mostly rarely,
  having two shoes a year,
  calling it death to leave the monastery;
  oftimes warning Tuotilo, who was given to travel, to beware of embraces.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
In scholis sedulus, plerumque cursus et missas neglegebat,
"bonas," inquiens, "missas audimus cum eas agi docemus."
-->
  Painstaking in classes, he neglected most of the lessons and masses,
  saying, "We hear good masses when we teach how to celebrate them."
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Qui cum labem maximam claustri impunitatem nominasset,
ad capitulum tamen nonnisi vocatus venit, 
cum sibi officium capitulandi et puniendi gravissimum, ut ait, sit traditum.
-->
  And although he'd called freedom from punishment the greatest fault of the monastery,
  nevertheless he didn't go to chapter unless summoned, since, as he said,
  the obligation of meeting and punishing handed to him  was heavy enough.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Tales cum essent tres isti nostrae rei publicae senatores - 
quod semper doctorum est et utilium - 
ab otio vacantibus et in levitate ambulantibus detractiones 
et dorsiloquia patiuntur assidua; 
sed maxime, quia minus refellere solebat, sanctus, ut vere asseram, domnus Notkerus.
-->
  Since such were these three senators of our republic -
  which is always the lot of the learned and helpful -
  they suffered constant slanders and backbiting
  from those given to idleness and from those who walk in levity;
  but especially, since he was less wont to refute them,
  the sainted, as indeed I might assert, master Notkerus.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Tuotilo quidem et Ratpertus acriores talibus minusque ad contumelias habiles,
rarius ab eis laedebantur; 
Notkerus autem, hominum mitissimus, quid iniuriae essent in semetipso didicit.
-->
  Indeed, Tuotilo and Ratpert, sharper to such things and less apt to insults,
  were more rarely annoyed by them;
  but Notkerus, a very meek man, learned what injuries might be in himself.
</p>
