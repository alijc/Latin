Sed, ut more navigantium loquar, ne diutius,
navim undis et vela ventis concedentes et a terra longius enavigantes, 
longum circumferamur inter tantas bellorum clades et annorum enumerationes,
ad id quod nos maxime ad hoc opus incitavit nobis esse redeundum censeo, 
scilicet aliquantulum, quantum meae cognitioni innotuit, 
de infantilibus et puerilibus domini mei venerabilis Aelfredi, 
Angulsaxonum regis, moribus hoc in loco breviter inserendum esse existimo.
-->
  But, to speak, not at length, but in the manner of sailors,
  who sail ship and sails on waves and winds away from land and out to sea,
  let us revolve far among such calamities of wars and enumerations of years,
  to return to that which, I think, most urges me to this work,
  I mean, a little bit at least, to briefly insert in this spot
  as much as I have learned about the character of our venerable lord Alfred,
  king of the Anglo-Saxons, in his childhood and youth.

Nam cum communi et ingenti patris sui et matris amore supra omnes fratres suos,
immo ab omnibus, nimium diligeretur et in regio semper curto inseparabiliter nutriretur, 
accrescente infantili et puerili aetate,
forma ceteris suis fratribus decentior videbatur vultuque et verbis atque moribus gratiosior.
-->
  For since he was so highly esteemed in his father and mother's shared
  and remarkable love, no indeed by everyone else, above all his brothers,
  and reared full-time in the royal court,
  as he grew in age through boyhood,
  his form seemed more becoming than his other brothers,
  and more agreeable in looks, speech and behavior.

Cui ab incunabilis ante omnia et cum omnibus praesentis vitae studiis, 
sapientiae desiderium cum nobilitate generis, nobilis mentis ingenium supplevit;
sed pro dolor! indigna suorum parentum et nutritorum incuria 
usque ad duodecimum aetatis annum aut eo amplius illiteratus permansit.
-->
  And from the cradle his nature, with the nobility of his birth and
  his noble mind, supplied him, before all else and with all else,
  with a zeal for the present life and a desire for wisdom;
  but alas! by the shameful neglect of his parents and carers
  he remained illiterate up to the age of twelve or more.

Sed Saxonica poemata die noctuque sollers auditor,
relatu aliorum saepissime audiens, docibilis memoriter retinebat.
-->
  But this clever listener, quick to learn, hearing, very often, day and night,
  others reciting Saxon poems, retained them in his memory.

<!--
In omni venatoria arte industrius venator incessabiliter laborat non in vanum; 
nam incomparabilis omnibus peritia et felicitate in illa arte sicut et 
in ceteris omnibus Dei donis fuit, sicut et nos saepissime vidimus.
-->
  An industrious hunter in each of its arts,
  he practiced ceaselessly, and not in vain;
  for, as we very often saw, unequalled skill and good fortune in that art,
  as among all others, was God's gift.
