<h4>CAROLOMANNUS AS A MONK</h4>
 
<p>
<!--
Anno Dominicae incarnationis DCCXLV.
-->
  In the year of our Lord's incarnation 745.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Carolomannus confessus est suo germano Pippino quod mente disposuisset
mundum relinquere et pro amore Dei regnum terrenum deserere, 
ut in futura vita centuplicatam reciperet possessionem.
-->
  Carolomannus confessed to his brother Pippin that he had made up his mind
  to relinquish the world and give up his earthy kingdom for the love of God,
  so that in the life to come he would receive possessions multiplied a
  hundred-fold. 

<!--
Et in hoc anno nullam fecerunt expeditionem sed praeparavit se uterque, 
Carolomannus ad iter quod decreverat, 
et Pippinus ut germanum suum ad locum honorifice cum muneribus et debita munificentia prosequeretur.
-->
  And in this year they made no campaign but each one prepared himself,
  Carolomannus for the journey that he had resolved on,
  and Pippin to escort his brother to the place honorably with gifts and
  fitting munificence.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Anno Dominicae incarnationis DCCXLVI.
-->
  In the year of the Lord 746.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Carolomannus Romam perrexit ibique se totondit 
et in Sarapte monte monasterium aedificavit 
in honore sancti Sylvestri ibique aliquod tempus moram faciens, 
exinde ad sanctum Benedictum in Cassinum usque pervenit et 
ibi monachus effectus est.
-->
  Carolomannus went to Rome and took the tonsure there
  and built a monastery on Mount Soratte in honor of Saint Sylvester.
  He tarried there for some time, and
  after that reached Saint Benedict on Mount Cassino
  and became a monk there.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Fertur autem de hoc sancto viro exemplum memorabile.
-->
  Now a memorable example is told about that holy man.

<!--
Cum adhuc Romae positus in monasterio quod sibi aedificaverat 
ab omnibus propter regiam nobilitatem et, quod maius est, 
propter contemptum regni terreni et gloriam praesentis saeculi veneraretur 
et laudibus extolleretur, timens vir Deo plenus favorem laudis humanae, 
qui tanta pro Christo reliquerat, 
fugam magis arripere disposuit quam vanae gloriae subiacere.
-->
  When he was still stationed in Rome in the monastery that he had built for
  himself, he was revered and lifted up in praise by all,
  on account of his royal nobility and, what is more,
  on account of his contempt for the earthly kingdom
  and for the renown of the present world.
  A man filled with God and fearing the applause of the world,
  who had forsaken such things for Christ -
  he arranged to take to flight rather than to fall to vain glories.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Et hoc tantummodum uno fido socio confessus, 
quem ab infantia in omnibus fidelem probaverat, 
cum eo noctu omnibus aufugit insciis, et ad Cassinum montem usque pervenit; 
nihil secum portans ex omnibus bonis quae corpori erant necessaria, 
nudus Christum secutus est.
-->
  And having disclosed this to only one single faithful associate,
  who had proved to be faithful in all things from infancy,
  as on the night he fled it all and arrived at Mount Cassino;
  carrying with him none of his possessions
  that were needful for the body, he followed Christ, stripped bare.

<!--
Et iuxta morem portam monasterii pulsans colloquium patris monasterii expetiit, 
in cuius praesentiam cum venisset, mox in terram corruit, se homicidam esse, 
se reum omnium criminum protestans, misericordiam exposcit, 
paenitentiae locum exquirit.
-->
  And as was the custom, he beat on the monastery gate, asking for an
  interview with the head of the monastery, and when he'd come in his presence,
  he straightway toppled to the ground, asserting that he was a murderer
  and guilty of every crime, requested mercy, and sought a place of repentance.
