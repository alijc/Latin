<h4>CAROLOMANNUS AS A MONK</h4>
 
<p>
<!--
Anno Dominicae incarnationis DCCXLV.
-->
  In the year of our Lord's incarnation 745.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Carolomannus confessus est suo germano Pippino quod mente disposuisset
mundum relinquere et pro amore Dei regnum terrenum deserere, 
ut in futura vita centuplicatam reciperet possessionem.
-->
  Carolomannus confessed to his brother Pippin that he had made up his mind
  to relinquish the world and give up his earthy kingdom for the love of God,
  so that in the life to come he would receive possessions multiplied a
  hundred-fold. 

<!--
Et in hoc anno nullam fecerunt expeditionem sed praeparavit se uterque, 
Carolomannus ad iter quod decreverat, 
et Pippinus ut germanum suum ad locum honorifice cum muneribus et debita munificentia prosequeretur.
-->
  And in this year they made no campaign but each one prepared himself,
  Carolomannus for the journey that he had resolved on,
  and Pippin to escort his brother to the place honorably with gifts and
  fitting munificence.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Anno Dominicae incarnationis DCCXLVI.
-->
  In the year of the Lord 746.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Carolomannus Romam perrexit ibique se totondit 
et in Sarapte monte monasterium aedificavit 
in honore sancti Sylvestri ibique aliquod tempus moram faciens, 
exinde ad sanctum Benedictum in Cassinum usque pervenit et 
ibi monachus effectus est.
-->
  Carolomannus went to Rome and took the tonsure there
  and built a monastery on Mount Soratte in honor of Saint Sylvester.
  He tarried there for some time, and
  after that reached Saint Benedict on Mount Cassino
  and became a monk there.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Fertur autem de hoc sancto viro exemplum memorabile.
-->
  Now a memorable example is told about that holy man.

<!--
Cum adhuc Romae positus in monasterio quod sibi aedificaverat 
ab omnibus propter regiam nobilitatem et, quod maius est, 
propter contemptum regni terreni et gloriam praesentis saeculi veneraretur 
et laudibus extolleretur, timens vir Deo plenus favorem laudis humanae, 
qui tanta pro Christo reliquerat, 
fugam magis arripere disposuit quam vanae gloriae subiacere.
-->
  When he was still stationed in Rome in the monastery that he had built for
  himself, he was revered and lifted up in praise by all,
  on account of his royal nobility and, what is more,
  on account of his contempt for the earthly kingdom
  and for the renown of the present world.
  A man filled with God and fearing the applause of the world,
  who had forsaken such things for Christ -
  he arranged to take to flight rather than to fall to vain glories.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Et hoc tantummodum uno fido socio confessus, 
quem ab infantia in omnibus fidelem probaverat, 
cum eo noctu omnibus aufugit insciis, et ad Cassinum montem usque pervenit; 
nihil secum portans ex omnibus bonis quae corpori erant necessaria, 
nudus Christum secutus est.
-->
  And having disclosed this to only one single faithful associate,
  who had proved to be faithful in all things from infancy,
  as on the night he fled it all and arrived at Mount Cassino;
  carrying with him none of his possessions
  that were needful for the body, he followed Christ, stripped bare.

<!--
Et iuxta morem portam monasterii pulsans colloquium patris monasterii expetiit, 
in cuius praesentiam cum venisset, mox in terram corruit, se homicidam esse, 
se reum omnium criminum protestans, misericordiam exposcit, 
paenitentiae locum exquirit.
-->
  And as was the custom, he beat on the monastery gate, asking for an
  interview with the head of the monastery, and when he'd come in his presence,
  he straightway toppled to the ground, asserting that he was a murderer
  and guilty of every crime, requested mercy, and sought a place of repentance.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Pater, cum hominem peregrinum esse cognovisset, 
interrogat cuius patriae aut gentis esset; 
at ille confessus est se Francum esse et ex Francia pro tali scelere migrasse,
exilium libenter ferre paratum, tantum ut patriam caelestem non amitteret.
-->
  When the abbot learned that the man was a foreigner,
  he asked which country or nation he was from.
  He confessed that he was a Frank and had left France for so great a sin
  that he was ready to bear exile willingly,
  so that he might not lose his heavenly home. 

<!--
Spiritualis pater, eius precibus annuens, 
praecepit eum in cella novitiorum recipi una cum suo collega, 
ibique probari secundum quod regula iubet, 
et tanto artius quanto barbarae et ignotae gentis homo erat, 
implens illud apostolicum: "Probate spiritus si ex Deo sunt."
-->
  The spiritual father, agreeing to his requests,
  ordered him to be taken to the novices' cell along with his companion,
  and commanded that he be examined there according to the Rule,
  rather strictly, as he was a man from a barbarian and ignorant people,
  quoting this from the Epistles: "Test whether the spirits are from God."

<!--
Itaque probatus in omni patientia sociatus est congregationi una cum collega, 
post emensum anni circulum professus stabilitatem, 
conversionem morum et oboedientiam secundum regulam sancti Benedicti.
-->
  And so, after being examined in every test, he was joined to the brotherhood
  together with his companion.
  And after a circle of a year had been measured, he promised steadfastness,
  converion of morals and obedience according to the rule of Saint Benedict.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Coepit autem inreprehensibiliter inter fratres conversari, 
omnibus virtutibus pollens.
-->
  Now he began to abide among the brothers without reproach,
  strong in every virtue. 
</p>

<p>
<!--
Accidit autem ut, iuxta quod mos est, 
ad coquinae officium hebdomadarius deputaretur; 
quod cum libenter quidem faceret sed in multis ignoranter offenderet, 
coquus vino exaestuans ei alapam dedit dicens: 
"Ita te fratribus deservire oportet?"
-->
  Now it happened that, according to the custom,
  he was posted to the kitchen for a week of duty;
  which he willingly did but unintentionally offended many,
  the cook, seething with wine, gave him a slap, saying:
  "Is it fitting for you to serve the brothers thus?"

<!--
Cui ille motus, placido vultu respondit: 
"Indulgeat tibi Dominus, frater, et Carolomannus."
-->
  And though deeply disturbed, he replied with a gentle mien:
  "May the Lord, and Carolomannus, be kind to you, brother."

<!--
Neque enim cuiquam nomen suum prodiderat ne ex vocabulo agnosceretur.
-->
  For he hadn't revealed his name to anyone, lest he be recognized by this
  name. 
</p>

<p>
<!--
Rursus cum in quibusdam cibariis administrandis errasset, 
iterum a coquo percussus est, cui eadem quae supra imprecatus est.
-->
  On another ocassion, when he'd made a mistake in in managing some foodstuffs,
  he was again struck by the cook, and answered him with the same prayer.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Et cum iam tertio a coquo crudeliter caederetur, 
indignatus ille comes individuus suae peregrinationis, 
quod tantus vir a tam vili persona tam contumeliose afficeretur, 
iam ferre non valens, 
arripuit pilum unde panis in holera fratrum mittendus conterebatur, 
et eum omni annisu percussit, dicens: 
"Nec tibi Deus parcat, serve nequam, nec Carolomannus indulgeat."
-->
  And when he was cruelly struck by the cook yet a third time,
  his inseparable travelling companion, indignant 
  that such a man should be afflicted so insultingly by such a mean person,
  and no longer able to bear it,
  seized the pestle which was used to pound bread into the brothers' greens,
  and struck him with all his might, saying:
  "May God not spare you, wicked slave, nor Carolomannus be kind to you."
</p>

<p>START</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Fratres hoc audito valde commoti sunt quod homo alienigena et
pro misericordia receptus talia facere praesumpsisset.
-->
  The brothers, on hearing this, were greatly agitated that a foreigner,
  and one who'd been taken in for mercy's sake, had presumed to say
  such a thing.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Protinus itaque custodiae mancipatur
 ut die sequenti talis praesumptio acrius vindicaretur.
-->
  And so he was at once put into custody
  so that such presumption might be punished on the following day.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
In crastinum productus de custodia in medio conventu sistitur;
percunctatus cur manus extendere in fratrem ministrum ausus fuisset, respondit:
"Quia," inquit, "vidi servum nequiorem omnibus, 
virum meliorem et nobiliorem omnium quos in terra conversari scio, 
non solum verbis dehonestari sed etiam plagis affici."
-->
  On the morrow he was led out of custody and put in the middle of the assembly;
  when asked why he'd dared to raise his hand against a brother servant,
  he answered:
  "Because I saw the servant, more worthless than everyone,
  not only dishonor with his words the man that I know to be the
  best and noblest man of all those who abide on earth,
  but even to harm him with blows."
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Furore nimio exagitati, quod eum qui peregrinus venerat ceteris praetulisset, 
interrogant quis esset ille qui bonitate et nobilitate omnes anteiret, 
cur saltem patrem monasterii non excepisset.
-->
  They, overly driven by rage, because he had preferred the one who
  had come as a pilgrim over the others,
  asked who it was that surpassed everyone else in goodness and nobility,
  and why he didn't make an exception for the abbot of the monastery at least.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Ille necessitate compulsus, 
celare non valens quod Deus iam manifestari volebat, ait: 
"Iste est Carolomannus, quondam rex Francorum, 
qui pro Christi amore regnum et gloriam mundi dereliquit, 
qui de tanta excellentia ita se humiliavit ut modo a vilissimis personis
non solum contumeliis afficiatur verum etiam verberibus affligatur."
-->
  Compelled by necessity and unable to conceal what God wished to now reveal,
  he said:
  "He is Carolomannus, the former king of the Franks,
  who forsook his kingdom and the glory of the world for the love of Christ,
  who from such an exhalted position humbles himself thus
  to be not only afflicted with indignities but indeed even battered with whips
  by the most worthless persons."
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quo audito tremefacti a sedibus surgunt, pedibus eius se prosternunt, 
veniam postulant de contemptu, ignorantiam profitentur; 
ille contra in terram provolutus, cum lacrimis negare coepit; 
haec non esse vera, non se esse Carolomannum, 
sed hominem peccatorem et homicidam; 
collegam suum perterritum propter commissum piaculum haec excogitasse.
-->
  And on hearing this they rose from their seats, all a-tremble,
  and protrating themselves at his feet and
  praying for pardon for the slight, they professed ignorance.
  He, facing them, prostrate on the ground, tearfully began to deny it -
  that these words were not true, that he was not Carolomannus,
  but a sinful man and a murderer - that his companion,
  terrified on account of the secret crime, had made the story up. 
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quid plura?
-->
  What happened next?
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Cognitus ab omnibus cum magna reverentia est observatus.
-->
  He was recognized by all and observed with great reverence.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Haec non passi sumus praeterire; nunc ad chronica revertamur.
-->
  We have not suffered to pass over these matters;
  now we return to the chonicles.
