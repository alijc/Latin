<h4>LIUTPRAND AT CONSTANTINOPLE</h4>

<p>
<!--
Rege Hugone Provinciae in partibus defuncto, 
Berengarii nomen celebre apud nonnullas praesertim apud Graecas exstitit nationes.
-->
  After King Hugh of Provence died in that region,
  the name of Berengar was was preeminent among several nations,
  especially the Greek ones.

<!--
Is enim Italicis omnibus principabatur virtute, rex vero Lotharius solo nomine.
-->
  For he was virtually the ruler of all the Italians,
  indeed Lothair was king in name only.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Constantinus itaque, qui deiectis Romano filiisque suis,
Constantinopoleos regebat imperium, 
audito Berengarium potentia praestare Lothario, per Andream quendam, 
qui ab officio comes curtis dicebatur, 
litteras Berengario dirigit in quibus continebatur vehementer se Berengarii nuntium velle videre; cuius in reditu cognosceret quanta eum caritate diligeret.
-->
  And so when Constantine, who had overthrown Romanos and his sons
  and was ruling the empire in Constantinople, heard,
  through a certain Andreas, who was told by the praetorian prefect's office,
  that Berengar had surpassed Lothair in power,
  he sent a letter to Berengar in which he vigorously maintained 
  that he wished to see Berengar's envoy;
  from whom on his return he might learn how great was his esteem for him.

<!--
Scripsit etiam et commendaticias eidem pro Lothario litteras 
ut fidelis ei esset administrator, cui Deo largiente exstiterat gubernator.
-->
  He also wrote a commendatory letter to him on behalf of Lothair,
  that he be a faithful administrator to him,
  for whom, by God's bountiful grace, he had been governor.

<!--
Constantinus namque sollicitudinem non parvam Lotharii pro salute habebat, 
religiose ob amorem nurus suae cogitans, quae Lotharii soror exstiterat.
-->
  For indeed, Constantine had not a little anxiety about Lothair's safety,
  piously reflecting on his affection for his daughter-in-law,
  who was Lothair's sister.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Berengarius itaque, calliditate qua erat suffarcinatus, 
cogitans quem potissimum mitteret cui nil impensae ob itineris longinquitatem praeberet, 
vitricum cuius tunc sub cura degebam veniens : 
"Quanti mihi," inquit, "esset privignum tuum Graecas litteras non ignorare?"
-->
  And so Berengar, stuffed full of cunning,
  thought on who it would be best to send
  for whom he need not pay anything for the long journey.
  Then, approaching the stepfather under whose care I was then living, said:
  "How much would be in it for me for your stepson to learn Greek letters?"

<!--
Cui cum diceret: 
"Uti divitiarum mearum ea gratia partem mediam distributam haberem!"
-->
  And when he said to him:
  "For this kindness I'd shell out half my wealth!"

<!--
"Non necesse," ait, "habes neque centesimam impertiri.
-->
  "Not necessary," he said, "you need not give so much as a penny.

<!--
Constantinopolitanus imperator litteris orat ut meum ad se nuntium dirigam.
-->
  In a letter the emperor of Constantinople prays that I send an envoy to him.

<!--
Quod cum ob animi constantiam nemo melius, 
tum ob dicendi copiam nemo commodius facere potest.
-->
  Because not only is there no-one better in steadiness of mind,
  but also no-one can speak at length more agreeably.

<!--
Quid dicam quam facile doctrinas ebibet Graecas 
qui tam puerilibus in annis epotavit Latinas?"
-->
  What could I say about how easily he'll drink Greek learning in,
  he who in such youthful years has drunk Latin learning dry?"
</p>

<p>
<!--
Hac spe quam mox vitricus animatus impensas omnes distribuit 
meque magnis cum muneribus Constantinopolim direxit.
-->
  Animated by this hope, my stepfather laid out all expenses as soon as
  possible and sent me to Constantinople with many gifts.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Die quippe Kalendarum Augustarum Papia exiens per Eridani alveum triduo Venetiam veni, 
ubi et Salemonem Graecorum nuntium, kitonitan, eunuchum, repperi, 
ab Hispania et Saxonia reversum Constantinopolim versus tendere cupientem,
secumque ducentem domini nostri, tunc regis nunc imperatoris,
magnis cum muneribus nuntium, Liutefredum scilicet, 
Magontinum institorem ditissimum.
-->
  And so, on Kalends of August I left Pavia and traveled along the Po for
  three days until I came to Venice,
  where I met the envoy Solomon, a Greek chamberlain, a eunuch who
  wished to find his way from Spain and Saxony back again to Constantinople,
  along with the guide from our master, then king and now emperor, with many
  gifts, the envoy Liutefredus, as you know, a wealthy merchant from Mayense.

<!--
Octavo denique Kalendas Septembres Venetia exeuntes, 
xv. Kalendas Octobres Constantinopolim venimus; 
ubi quam inaudito miroque simus modo recepti scribere non pigebit.
-->
  Finally leaving Venice on the eighth of Kalends of September,
  we arrived at Constantinople on 15 Kalends of October.
  It doesn't grieve me to write of the unheard of and wonderful way
  in which we were recieved there.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Est Constantinopolim domus palatio contigua, 
mirae magnitudinis seu pulchritudinis, 
quae a Graecis per v loco digammae positam magnavra, quasi magna aura, dicitur.
-->
  There is in Constantinople a house adjoining the palace,
  of wonderful size and beauty,
  which the Greeks, having replaced the Greek letter digamma (w) with a Latin
  v/u, call the Magnavra,
  like 'magna aura' (Great Gold, or maybe 'magna aula', Great Hall).

<!--
Hanc itaque Constantinus, cum ob Hispanorum nuntios qui tunc eo noviter venerant, 
tum ob me et Liutefredum hoc modo praeparari iussit.
-->
  And so Constantine ordered this house to be prepared not only
  for the Spanish envoys who had then recently arrived,
  but also for me and Liutefredus, in this way.

<!--
Aerea sed deaurata quaedam arbor ante imperatoris sedile stabat, 
cuius ramos itidem aereae diversi generis deaurataeque aves replebant, 
quae secundum species suas diversarum avium voces emittebant.
-->
  A certain tree, made of brass but gilded, stood before the emperor's seat,
  whose branches were filled with all sorts of birds, also of gilded brass,
  which gave out different calls, according to their species.

<!--
Imperatoris vero solium huiusmodi erat arte compositum ut in momento humile, 
excelsius modo, quam mox videretur sublime; 
quod immensae magnitudinis, incertum utrum aerei an lignei,
verum auro tecti leones quasi custodiebant, qui cauda terram percutientes, 
aperto ore, linguisque mobilibus rugitum emittebant.
-->
  Indeed, the emperor's throne was of this sort - artfully constructed
  so that, with a slight effort, it could be elevated in a way,
  to be seen up high;
  And immense lions, of brass maybe or possibly wood, but surely
  covered with gold, stood as if on guard duty.
  They struck the ground with their tails, and roared through open mouths,
  with their tongues moving. 
</p>

<p>
<!--
In hac igitur duorum eunuchorum umeris incumbens ante imperatoris praesentiam sum deductus.
-->
  And so, I was carried into this house on the shoulders of two eunuchs
  and prostrated myself before presence of the emperor.

<!--
Cumque in adventu meo rugitum leones emitterent, 
aves secundum species suas perstreperent, nullo sum terrore, 
nulla admiratione commotus, 
quoniam quid ex his omnibus eos qui bene noverant fueram percontatus.
-->
  And upon my arrival, when the lions roared and the birds sounded,
  according to their species, I was stirred with neither fear
  nor astonishment,
  because I had asked what to expect from those who knew it well.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Tertio itaque pronus imperatorem adorans caput sustuli, 
et quem prius moderata mensura a terra elevatum sedere vidi, 
mox aliis indutum vestibus penes domus laquear sedere prospexi.
-->
  And so I prostrated myself three times in homage to the emperor.
  Then I lifted my head and saw him, who had earlier been sitting
  a little way from the ground, now far above at the building's ceiling,
  clothed in other vestments.

<!--
Quod qualiter fieret cogitare non potui,
nisi forte eo sit subvectus argalio quo torcularium arbores subvehuntur.
-->
  And I had no idea how that could have happened,
  unless perhaps he'd been carried upwards by an apparatus
  similar to a wine press, that's used to lift beams.

<!--
Per se autem tunc nihil locutus quoniam etsi vellet intercapedo maxima indecorum faceret, de vita Berengarii et sospitate per logothetam est percontatus.
-->
  Although he himself said nothing then, since the great distance between us
  would have make it indecorous,
  he inquired through his chancelor about Berengar's life and health.

<!--
Cui cum consequenter respondissem, 
interprete sum innuente egressus et in datum mihi hospitium mox receptus.
-->
  And after I answered him in return,
  the interpreter beckoned to me and I was led out and shortly recieved into
  the lodging given me.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Sed ne hoc pigeat memorare quid tunc pro Berengario egerim, 
scilicet ut agnoscatur quanta hunc caritate dilexerim 
et cuiusmodi ab eo recompensationem pro bene gestis acceperim.
-->
  But it shouldn't be painful to remember what I did for Berengar then,
  naturally, that he be acknowledged by the great love that I held for him and
  that I might well accept recompense from him of whatever sort for my deeds.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Hispanorum nuntii et nominatus Liutefredus,
domini nostri tunc regis Ottonis nuntius,
magna ex eorum dominis parte, munera imperatori Constantino detulerant.
-->
  The Spanish envoys and the man called Liutefredus,
  the envoy of our lord, the then King Otto, present gifts,
  for the most part from their lords, to the Emperor Constantine.

<!--
Ego vero Berengarii ex parte nihil praeter epistolam, 
et hanc mendacio plenam, detuleram.
-->
  While I indeed had brought nothing from Berengar but a letter,
  and this full of deceit.

<!--
Aestuabat itaque non parum hac pro verecundia animus,
et quid super hac re faceret cogitabat attentius.
-->
  And so my mind burned not a little on account of this shame,
  and diligently considered what to do about this matter.

<!--
Aestuanti autem et mihi nimium fluctuanti mens suggessit
quatenus dona quae imperatori mea ex parte detuleram Berengarii
ex parte conferrem, parvumque munus prout possem verbis ornarem.
-->
  But in my seething and dithering my mind suggested that 
  I could unite the gifts that I'd brought to the emperor on my own part
  with Berengar's, and I could garnish the small gift with words.

<!--
Obtuli autem loricas optimas novem, scuta optima cum bullis deauratis septem,
coppas argenteas deauratas duas, enses, lanceas, verua, 
mancipia quattuor carzimasia, imperatori nominatis omnibus pretiosiora.
-->
  Now I presented nine of the best coats of mail, seven very good shields
  with gilded bosses, two gilded silver vessels, swords, lances, javelins, and
  four enslaved eunuchs, with everything reported to the emperor as costly.
</p>

<p>START</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
His itaque gestis imperator me post triduum ad palatium vocare praecepit 
proprioque mecum ore locutus, ad convivium invitavit 
magnoque post convivium me meosque asseculas munere donavit.
-->
  And so, three days after these were brought in, the emperor had me
  summoned to the palace and, speaking to me with his own mouth,
  invited me to a banquet and presented me and my attendants with a great gift
  after the banquet. 
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Verum quia narrandi se occasio intulit qualis eius sit mensa, 
festis praecipue diebus, 
qualesque ad mensam ludi celebrentur bonum non opinor silere sed scribere.
-->
  To be sure, since going to be told >self the opportunity brought in his
  such it might be a meal/table,
  especially on feast days,
  and suches at table plays were performed >good not I suppose to be silent but
  to write.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Est domus iuxta hippodromum, aquilonem versus, 
mirae altitudinis seu pulchritudinis, quae Decanneacubita vocatur, 
quod nomen non ab re sed ex apparentibus causis sortita est; 
deca enim Graece, Latine decem, ennea novem, 
cubita autem a cubando inclinata vel curvata possumus dicere.
-->
  There's a building near the hippodrome, to the north,
  of marvelous height and beauty, which is called the Decanneacubita,
  which name was choosen from no cause but obvious ones,
  for in Greek "deca" is ten, "ennea" nine and "cubita" is a couch,
  but  from for lying down inclining or curved we can say.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Hoc autem ideo quoniam quidem decem et novem mensae in ea quae 
secundum carnem est Domini nostri Iesu Christi nativitate apponuntur.
-->
  But this therefore since indeed nineteen tables in it which
  according to meat is at the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ were set.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
In quibus imperator pariter et convivae non sedendo, ut ceteris diebus, 
sed recumbendo epulantur; 
quibus in diebus non argenteis sed aureis tantum vasis ministratur.
-->
  On which the emperor together and guests going to be seated, as on other days,
  but feasted reclining;
  on which days not in silver but in gold vessels it was served.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Post cibum autem aureis vasis tribus sunt poma delata, 
quae ob immensum pondus non hominum manibus sed purpura tectis vehiculis sunt allata.
-->
  But after the meal fruits were carried down in three gold vessels,
  which on account of their immense weight were carried, not in men's hands
  but in carriages covered with purple.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Apponuntur autem duo hoc in mensam modo.
-->
  But they were placed two on a table in this way.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Per foramina laquearis tres sunt funes pellibus deauratis tecti 
cum anulis depositi aureis, qui ansis quae in scutulis prominent positi, 
adiuvantibus inferius quattuor aut eo amplius hominibus, 
per vertibile quod supra laqueum est ergalium in mensam subvehuntur 
eodemque modo deponuntur.
-->
  Three ropes of gilded leather covered with gold rings are let fall
  through an aperture in the ceiling, and the rings are set around the
  handles that project from the shallow dishes, and,
  aided by four or more men below,
  they are hauled upward by a windlass above the ceiling and then set down in
  the same way.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Ludos denique quos ibi perspexerim, quia nimis longum est scribere, praetermitto.
-->
  Finally, I will pass over the entertainments that I observed there,
  since it would take too long to write down.
</p>

<p>END</p>
