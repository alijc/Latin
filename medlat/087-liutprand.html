<h4>LIUTPRAND AT CONSTANTINOPLE</h4>

<p>START</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Rege Hugone Provinciae in partibus defuncto, 
Berengarii nomen celebre apud nonnullas praesertim apud Graecas exstitit nationes.
-->
  When King Hugh of Provence died in that region,
  the celebrated name of Berengar stood out before several nations,
  especially the Greek ones.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Is enim Italicis omnibus principabatur virtute, rex vero Lotharius solo nomine.
-->
  For he was virtually the ruler of all the Italians,
  indeed Lothair was king in name only.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Constantinus itaque, qui deiectis Romano filiisque suis,
Constantinopoleos regebat imperium, 
audito Berengarium potentia praestare Lothario, per Andream quendam, 
qui ab officio comes curtis dicebatur, 
litteras Berengario dirigit in quibus continebatur vehementer se Berengarii nuntium velle videre; cuius in reditu cognosceret quanta eum caritate diligeret.
-->
  And so when Constantine, who had overthrown Romanos and his sons
  and was ruling the empire in Constantinople, heard,
  through a certain Andreas, who was told by the praetorian prefect's office,
  that Berengar had passed into power over Lothair,
  he sent a letter to Berengar in which he vigorously maintained 
  that he wished to see Berengar's envoy;
  from whom on his return he might learn how great was his esteem for him.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Scripsit etiam et commendaticias eidem pro Lothario litteras 
ut fidelis ei esset administrator, cui Deo largiente exstiterat gubernator.
-->
  He also wrote a commendatory letter to him on behalf of Lothair,
  so that he might be a faithful administrator to him,
  for whom, by God's bountiful grace, he had been governor.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Constantinus namque sollicitudinem non parvam Lotharii pro salute habebat, 
religiose ob amorem nurus suae cogitans, quae Lotharii soror exstiterat.
-->
  For indeed, Constantine had not a little anxiety about Lothair's safety,
  piously reflecting on his affection for his daughter-in-law,
  who had been Lothair's sister.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Berengarius itaque, calliditate qua erat suffarcinatus, 
cogitans quem potissimum mitteret cui nil impensae ob itineris longinquitatem praeberet, 
vitricum cuius tunc sub cura degebam veniens : 
"Quanti mihi," inquit, "esset privignum tuum Graecas litteras non ignorare?"
-->
  And so Berengar, stuffed full of cunning,
  thought on who it would be best to send
  on whom he need not pay anything for the long journey.
  Then, approaching the stepfather under whose care I was then living, said:
  "How much would you pay me for your stepson to learn to write in Greek?"
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Cui cum diceret: 
"Uti divitiarum mearum ea gratia partem mediam distributam haberem!"
-->
  And when he said to him:
  "For this kindness I'd shell out half my wealth!"
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
"Non necesse," ait, "habes neque centesimam impertiri.
-->
  "Not necessary," he said, "you need not give even a hundredth.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Constantinopolitanus imperator litteris orat ut meum ad se nuntium dirigam.
-->
  In a letter the emperor of Constantinople prays that I direct my envoy to him.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quod cum ob animi constantiam nemo melius, 
tum ob dicendi copiam nemo commodius facere potest.
-->
  Because not only is there no-one better in the steadiness of mind,
  but also no-one can more fittingly make an abundance for speaking.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quid dicam quam facile doctrinas ebibet Graecas 
qui tam puerilibus in annis epotavit Latinas?"
-->
  What could I say about how easily he'll drink Greek learning in,
  he who in such youthful years has drunk Latin learning dry?"
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Hac spe quam mox vitricus animatus impensas omnes distribuit 
meque magnis cum muneribus Constantinopolim direxit.
-->
  With this hope my animated stepfather laid out all expenses as soon as
  possible and directed me to Constantinople with many gifts.
</p>
