<h4>LIUTPRAND AT CONSTANTINOPLE</h4>

<p>AJC
<!--
Rege Hugone Provinciae in partibus defuncto, 
Berengarii nomen celebre apud nonnullas praesertim apud Graecas exstitit nationes.
-->
  After King Hugh of Provence died in that region,
  the name of Berengar was was preeminent among several nations,
  especially the Greek ones.

<!--
Is enim Italicis omnibus principabatur virtute, rex vero Lotharius solo nomine.
-->
  For he was virtually the ruler of all the Italians,
  indeed Lothair was king in name only.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Constantinus itaque, qui deiectis Romano filiisque suis,
Constantinopoleos regebat imperium, 
audito Berengarium potentia praestare Lothario, per Andream quendam, 
qui ab officio comes curtis dicebatur, 
litteras Berengario dirigit in quibus continebatur vehementer se Berengarii nuntium velle videre; cuius in reditu cognosceret quanta eum caritate diligeret.
-->
  And so when Constantine, who had overthrown Romanos and his sons
  and was ruling the empire in Constantinople, heard,
  through a certain Andreas, who was told by the praetorian prefect's office,
  that Berengar had surpassed Lothair in power,
  he sent a letter to Berengar in which he vigorously maintained 
  that he wished to see Berengar's envoy;
  from whom on his return he might learn how great was his esteem for him.

<!--
Scripsit etiam et commendaticias eidem pro Lothario litteras 
ut fidelis ei esset administrator, cui Deo largiente exstiterat gubernator.
-->
  He also wrote a commendatory letter to him on behalf of Lothair,
  that he be a faithful administrator to him,
  for whom, by God's bountiful grace, he had been governor.

<!--
Constantinus namque sollicitudinem non parvam Lotharii pro salute habebat, 
religiose ob amorem nurus suae cogitans, quae Lotharii soror exstiterat.
-->
  For indeed, Constantine had not a little anxiety about Lothair's safety,
  piously reflecting on his affection for his daughter-in-law,
  who was Lothair's sister.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Berengarius itaque, calliditate qua erat suffarcinatus, 
cogitans quem potissimum mitteret cui nil impensae ob itineris longinquitatem praeberet, 
vitricum cuius tunc sub cura degebam veniens : 
"Quanti mihi," inquit, "esset privignum tuum Graecas litteras non ignorare?"
-->
  And so Berengar, stuffed full of cunning,
  thought on who it would be best to send
  for whom he need not pay anything for the long journey.
  Then, approaching the stepfather under whose care I was then living, said:
  "How much would be in it for me for your stepson to learn Greek letters?"

<!--
Cui cum diceret: 
"Uti divitiarum mearum ea gratia partem mediam distributam haberem!"
-->
  And when he said to him:
  "For this kindness I'd shell out half my wealth!"

<!--
"Non necesse," ait, "habes neque centesimam impertiri.
-->
  "Not necessary," he said, "you need not give so much as a penny.

<!--
Constantinopolitanus imperator litteris orat ut meum ad se nuntium dirigam.
-->
  In a letter the emperor of Constantinople prays that I send an envoy to him.

<!--
Quod cum ob animi constantiam nemo melius, 
tum ob dicendi copiam nemo commodius facere potest.
-->
  Because not only is there no-one better in steadiness of mind,
  but also no-one can speak at length more agreeably.

<!--
Quid dicam quam facile doctrinas ebibet Graecas 
qui tam puerilibus in annis epotavit Latinas?"
-->
  What could I say about how easily he'll drink Greek learning in,
  he who in such youthful years has drunk Latin learning dry?"
</p>

<p>
<!--
Hac spe quam mox vitricus animatus impensas omnes distribuit 
meque magnis cum muneribus Constantinopolim direxit.
-->
  Animated by this hope, my stepfather laid out all expenses as soon as
  possible and sent me to Constantinople with many gifts.
</p>

<!--
Die quippe Kalendarum Augustarum Papia exiens per Eridani alveum triduo Venetiam veni, 
ubi et Salemonem Graecorum nuntium, kitonitan, eunuchum, repperi, 
ab Hispania et Saxonia reversum Constantinopolim versus tendere cupientem,
secumque ducentem domini nostri, tunc regis nunc imperatoris,
magnis cum muneribus nuntium, Liutefredum scilicet, 
Magontinum institorem ditissimum.
-->
  And so, on Kalends of August I left Pavia and traveled along the Po for
  three days until I came to Venice,
  where I met Solomon, a Greek chamberlain and envoy, a eunuch who
  wished to find his way from Spain and Saxony back again to Constantinople,
  along with the guide from our master, then king and now emperor, with many
  gifts, the envoy Liutefredus, as you know, a wealthy merchant from Mayense.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Octavo denique Kalendas Septembres Venetia exeuntes, 
xv. Kalendas Octobres Constantinopolim venimus; 
ubi quam inaudito miroque simus modo recepti scribere non pigebit.
-->
  Finally leaving Venice on the eighth of Kalends of September,
  we arrived at Constantinople on 15 Kalends of October.
  It shames me to write of the unheard of and wonderful way
  in which we were recieved there.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Est Constantinopolim domus palatio contigua, 
mirae magnitudinis seu pulchritudinis, 
quae a Graecis per v loco digammae positam magnavra, quasi magna aura, dicitur.
-->
  There is in Constantinople a house adjoining the palace,
  of wonderful size and beauty,
  which the Greeks, having replaced the Greek letter digamma (w) with a Latin
  v/u, call the Magnavra,
  like 'magna aura' (Great Gold, or maybe 'magna aula', Great Hall).
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Hanc itaque Constantinus, cum ob Hispanorum nuntios qui tunc eo noviter venerant, 
tum ob me et Liutefredum hoc modo praeparari iussit.
-->
  And so Constantine ordered this house to be prepared not only
  for the Spanish envoys who had then recently arrived,
  but also for me and Liutefredus, in this way.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Aerea sed deaurata quaedam arbor ante imperatoris sedile stabat, 
cuius ramos itidem aereae diversi generis deaurataeque aves replebant, 
quae secundum species suas diversarum avium voces emittebant.
-->
  A certain tree, made of brass but gilded, stood before the emperor's seat,
  whose branches were filled with all sorts of birds, also of gilded brass,
  which gave out different calls, according to their species.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Imperatoris vero solium huiusmodi erat arte compositum ut in momento humile, 
excelsius modo, quam mox videretur sublime; 
quod immensae magnitudinis, incertum utrum aerei an lignei,
verum auro tecti leones quasi custodiebant, qui cauda terram percutientes, 
aperto ore, linguisque mobilibus rugitum emittebant.
-->
  Indeed, the emperor's throne was of this sort - artfully constructed
  so that, with a slight effort, it could be elevated in a way,
  to be seen up high;
  And immense lions, of brass maybe or possibly wood, but surely
  covered with gold, stood as if on guard duty.
  They struck the ground with their tails, and roared through open mouths,
  with their tongues moving. 
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
In hac igitur duorum eunuchorum umeris incumbens ante imperatoris praesentiam sum deductus.
-->
  And so, I was carried into this house on the shoulders of two eunuchs
  and prostrated myself before presence of the emperor.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Cumque in adventu meo rugitum leones emitterent, 
aves secundum species suas perstreperent, nullo sum terrore, 
nulla admiratione commotus, 
quoniam quid ex his omnibus eos qui bene noverant fueram percontatus.
-->
  And upon my arrival, when the lions roared and the birds sounded,
  according to their species, I was stirred with neither fear
  nor astonishment,
  because I had asked what to expect from those who knew it well.
