<!--DE ORIGINE GENTIS SAXONICAE-->
<h4>On the Origin of the Saxon Tribe</h4>


<p>AJC
<!--
Et primum quidem de origine statuque gentis pauca expediam,
solam paene famam sequens in hac parte, 
nimia vetustate omnem fere certitudinem obscurante.
-->
  Indeed, let me first explain a bit about the origin and condition of these
  people, following mostly conjecture in this part,
  as so much time has obscured nearly every certainty.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Nam super hac re varia opinio est,
aliis arbitrantibus de Danis Northmannisque originem duxisse Saxones,
aliis autem aestimantibus, 
ut ipse adulescentulus audivi quendam praedicantem de Graecis, 
quia ipsi dicerent Saxones reliquias fuisse Macedonici exercitus qui, 
secutus Magnum Alexandrum, immatura morte ipsius per totum orbem sit dispersus.
-->
  For there are varying opinions on this,
  with some judging that the Saxons came from Danes and Normans,
  but others valuing, as I myself have heard as a young man,
  a certain declaration from the Greeks, who said
  that the Saxons were the remnants of a Macedonian army,
  which, after following Alexander the Great,
  was scattered all over the world upon his untimely death.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Ceterum gentem antiquam et nobilem fuisse non ambigitur; 
de quibus et in contione Agrippae ad Iudaeos in Iosepho oratio contexitur, 
et Lucani poetae sententia probatur.
-->
  Still, there is no doubt that was an ancient and noble tribe;
  and an oration about them is entwined both in Agrippa's speech to the Jews
  and in Josephus, and is demonstrated in the opinion of the poet Lucan.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Pro certo autem novimus Saxones his regionibus navibus advectos 
et loco primum applicuisse qui usque hodie nuncupatur Hadolaun.
-->
  But we know for certain that the Saxons were carried into these parts
  on ships and first landed at the spot that's today called Hadolaun. 
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Incolis vero adventum eorum graviter ferentibus, 
qui Thuringi traduntur fuisse, arma contra eos movent; 
Saxonibus vero acriter resistentibus, portum obtinent.
-->
  Indeed, when the inhabitants, who are purported to have been Thuringians,
  took their coming ill, they took up arms against them;
  but the Saxons resisted bitterly, and held the port.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Diu deinde inter se dimicantibus et multis hinc inde cadentibus, 
placuit utrisque de pace tractare, foedus inire; 
actumque est foedus eo pacto quo haberent Saxones vendendi emendique copiam, 
ceterum ab agris, a caede hominum atque rapina abstinerent; 
stetitque illud foedus inviolabiliter multis diebus.
-->
  Then, after a long period of fighting between them, with many falling on both
  sides, it pleased them both to discuss a peace, and to enter into a treaty;
  and the treaty was made on the agreement that the Saxons should be able to
  to sell and buy supplies.
  What's more, they'd refrain from plundering fields and slaughtering men.
  And that treaty stood inviolably for many days.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Cumque Saxonibus defecisset pecunia, quid venderent aut emerent non habentibus,
inutilem sibi pacem esse arbitrabantur.
-->
  But when the Saxons ran short of money, not having anything to buy and sell,
  they decided that the peace was useless for them.
