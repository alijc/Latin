<!--DE ORIGINE GENTIS SAXONICAE-->
<h4>On the Origin of the Saxon Tribe</h4>

<p>
<!--
Et primum quidem de origine statuque gentis pauca expediam,
solam paene famam sequens in hac parte, 
nimia vetustate omnem fere certitudinem obscurante.
-->
  Indeed, let me first explain a bit about the origin and condition of these
  people, following mostly conjecture in this part,
  as so much time has obscured nearly every certainty.

<!--
Nam super hac re varia opinio est,
aliis arbitrantibus de Danis Northmannisque originem duxisse Saxones,
aliis autem aestimantibus, 
ut ipse adulescentulus audivi quendam praedicantem de Graecis, 
quia ipsi dicerent Saxones reliquias fuisse Macedonici exercitus qui, 
secutus Magnum Alexandrum, immatura morte ipsius per totum orbem sit dispersus.
-->
  For there are varying opinions on this,
  with some judging that the Saxons came from Danes and Normans,
  but others valuing, as I myself have heard as a young man,
  a certain declaration from the Greeks, who said
  that the Saxons were the remnants of a Macedonian army,
  which, after following Alexander the Great,
  was scattered all over the world upon his untimely death.

<!--
Ceterum gentem antiquam et nobilem fuisse non ambigitur; 
de quibus et in contione Agrippae ad Iudaeos in Iosepho oratio contexitur, 
et Lucani poetae sententia probatur.
-->
  Still, there is no doubt that was an ancient and noble tribe;
  and mention is made of them both in Agrippa's speech to the Jews
  and in Josephus, and is demonstrated in the opinion of the poet Lucan.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Pro certo autem novimus Saxones his regionibus navibus advectos 
et loco primum applicuisse qui usque hodie nuncupatur Hadolaun.
-->
  But we know for certain that the Saxons were carried into these parts
  on ships and first landed at the spot that's today called Hadolaun. 

<!--
Incolis vero adventum eorum graviter ferentibus, 
qui Thuringi traduntur fuisse, arma contra eos movent; 
Saxonibus vero acriter resistentibus, portum obtinent.
-->
  Now the inhabitants, who are purported to have been Thuringians,
  took their coming ill, and took up arms against them;
  but the Saxons resisted bitterly, and held the port.

<!--
Diu deinde inter se dimicantibus et multis hinc inde cadentibus, 
placuit utrisque de pace tractare, foedus inire; 
actumque est foedus eo pacto quo haberent Saxones vendendi emendique copiam, 
ceterum ab agris, a caede hominum atque rapina abstinerent; 
stetitque illud foedus inviolabiliter multis diebus.
-->
  Then, after a long period of fighting between them, with many falling on both
  sides, it pleased them both to discuss a peace and to enter into a treaty;
  and the treaty was made on the agreement that the Saxons should be able to
  to sell and buy supplies, but 
  they'd refrain from plundering fields and slaughtering men.
  And that treaty stood inviolably for many days.

<!--
Cumque Saxonibus defecisset pecunia, quid venderent aut emerent non habentibus,
inutilem sibi pacem esse arbitrabantur.
-->
  But when the Saxons ran short of money, not having anything to buy and sell,
  they decided that the peace was useless for them.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Ea igitur tempestate contigit adulescentem quendam egredi de navibus 
oneratum multo auro, torque aurea simulque armillis aureis; 
cui obvius quidam Thuringorum: 
"Quid sibi vult," inquit, "tam ingens aurum circa tuum famelicum collum?"
-->
  And so it happened at that time that a certain young man left the ships,
  loaded down with much gold, with a gold torc and gold bracelets as well;
  and one of the Thuringians met him and said:
  "What's the point of having so damn much gold around your starving neck?"

<!--
"Emptorem," inquit, "quaero; 
ad nihil aliud istud aurum gero; quia fame periclitor, quo auro delecter?"
-->
  "I'm looking for a buyer", he said, "I'm wearing this gold for no other
  reason; since I'm in danger of starving, how could I enjoy gold?"

<!--
At ille qualitatem quantitatemque pretii rogat.
-->
  And the first man asked how much the price was.

<!--
"Nullum," inquit Saxo, "mihi est discrimen in pretio; quicquid dabis gratum teneo."
-->
  "The difference in price is nothing to me." the Saxon said,
  "I'll take whatever you offer."

<!--
Ille vero subridens adulescentem: 
"Quid si," inquit, "de isto pulvere sinum tibi impleo?" â€” 
erat enim in praesenti loco egesta humus plurima.
-->
  Now the first man smiled at the young man and said:
  "What if I fill your tunic with that there dust?" -
  for there were huge mounds of dirt heaped up in that place.

<!--
Saxo nihil cunctatus aperit sinum et accipit humum ilicoque Thuringo tradidit aurum.
-->
  Without delay the Saxon opened his tunic and received the dirt and at once
  handed his gold over to the Thuringian.

<!--
Laetus uterque ad suos repedat.
-->
  And each man returned, happy, to his own people.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Thuringi Thuringum laudibus ad caelum tollunt, 
qui nobili fraude Saxonem deceperit fortunatumque 
eum inter omnes mortales fuisse, qui vili pretio tam ingens aurum possederit.
-->
  The Thuringians praised the first Thuringian to high heaven,
  he who could cheat the Saxon with a remarkable ruse
  that had made him wealthy among all mortal men,
  and who could have gotten so much gold at a cheap price.

<!--
Ceterum certi de victoria de Saxonibus iam quasi triumphabant.
-->
  What's more, they now celebrated as if assured of victory over the Saxons.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Interea Saxo privatus auro, oneratus vero multa humo, appropiat navibus.
-->
  Meanwhile the Saxon, deprived of his gold but loaded down with much dirt,
  approached the ships.

<!--
Sociis igitur ei occurrentibus et quid ageret admirantibus, 
alii eum irridere coeperunt, alii arguere, 
omnes pariter amentem eum crediderunt.
-->
  And so his comrades ran up to him and wondered at what he had done,
  some began to mock him, and others blamed him, but all equally thought him mad.

<!--
At ille postulato silentio: 
"Sequimini, "inquit," me, optimi Saxones, 
et meam vobis amentiam probabitis utilem."
-->
  But he asked for silence and said:
  "Follow me, noble Saxons,
  and you'll find my madness useful to you."

<!--
At illi, licet dubii, sequuntur tamen ducem.
-->
  And although they were doubtful, they nevertheless followed their leader.

<!--
Ille autem sumpta humo per vicinos agros quam potuit subtiliter sparsit et castrorum loca occupavit.
-->
  But he took the pile of dirt and sprinkled it, as finely as possible, through
  the neighboring fields, and took possession of the spot for a camp.
