<!--AD ADALBERONEM REMORUM ARCHIEPISCOPUM-->
<h4>To Adalberon, the archbishop of Reims</h4>

<!--
Mantuae quid egerim super negotiis vestris praesens melius explicabo verbis quam absens scriptis.
-->
  What I could have done concerning your work in Mantua I will explain more
  in person in speech than in writing from a distance.

<!--
Claves librorum quas mitterem ignoravi propter communem usum similium serarum.
-->
  I don't know which keys I should send for the books
  because they all got jumbled together.

<!--
Historiam Iulii Caesaris a domno Azone abbate Dervensi ad rescribendum nobis adquirite, ut quos penes vos habemus habeatis et quos post repperimus speretis, id est VIII volumina Boetii de astrologia, praeclarissima quoque figurarum gometriae, aliaque non minus admiranda.
-->
  Pray obtain the history of Julius Caesar from his lordship Adso,
  the abbot of Montier-en-Der, and copy it for us,
  so that you may have those that we have for yourselves
  and you may hope for those that we later found,
  that is, 8 volumes of Boetius on astrology,
  also the very famous one on the forms of geometry,
  and others no less remarkable.

<!--
Fortunam nostram sola vestra conturbat absentia noctesque diesque.
-->
  Only your absence disturbs our prosperity, day and night.
