<h4>AJC To Hugh from His One-time Teacher Gerbert</h4>

<p>AJC
<!--
Secundum amplitudinem animi mei amplissimis honoribus ditavit me dominus meus.
-->
  My lord has enriched me, according to the breadth of my soul,
  with the greatest honors. 
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Nam quae pars Italiae possessiones beati Columbani non continet?
-->
  For which part of Italy does not hold on to the blessed Columbanus' property?
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Hoc quidem ita ex largitate et benevolentia nostri Caesaris.
-->
  Indeed this is so due to the largess and benevolence of our Caesar.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Fortuna vero aliter instituit.
-->
  Truly, Fortune decided otherwise.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Secundum amplitudinem quippe mei animi amplissimis me honeravit hostibus.
-->
  Of course, it has honored me, according to the breadth of my soul, with the
  greatest enemies. 
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Nam quae pars Italiae meos non habet hostes?
-->
  For which part of Italy does not hold my enemies?
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Vires meae impares sunt viribus Italiae.
-->
  My powers are unequal to those of Italy.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Condicio pacis haec est: si spoliatus servio, ferire desinent.
-->
  The condition of peace is this: if I bear being plundered, they won't kill me.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Vestitum, districtum, prosequentur gladiis.
-->
  If I demand my own, they'll pursue me with swords. 
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Ubi gladio ferire nequibunt, iaculis verborum appetent.
-->
  When they can't kill me with a sword, they'll assail me with darts of words.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Contemnitur imperialis maiestas, cum in me tum in se ipsa in divisione sanctuarii Dei.
-->
  The imperial majesty is scorned,
  not only in regards to me but even against its very self
  in the distribution of a sanctuary of God.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Secundum libellarias leges facta quia consentire nolo, perfidus, crudelis, tyrannus cognominor.
-->
  Because I am unwilling to consent to the things done according to the leases,
  I'm labelled a cruel tyrant.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Ipse Caesar omnium hominum excellentissimus a furciferis asino coaequatur.
-->
  Caesar himself, the most excellent of all men,
  is regarded as an ass by the scoundrels.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
O amicorum fidissime, ne deseras amicum consilio et auxilio.
-->
  O most faithful of friends, pray you not desert a friend with counsel and aid.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Recordare quid te oraverim, me malle esse militem in Caesarianis castris quam regem in extraneis.
-->
  Remember what I told you, that I'd prefer to be a soldier in Caesar's camp
  than a king outside of it.
