<!--EBRARDO ABBATI TURONENSI-->
<h4>AJC To Eberhard, the Abbot of Tours</h4>

<p>AJC
<!--
Cum mei memoriam frequentem habeatis inter honesta,
ut e plurimis accepi legatis, magnamque affinitatis iure amicitiam efferatis, 
existimatione vestra beatum me fore puto, 
si modo is sum qui iudicio tanti viri inveniar dignus amari.
-->
  Since you ofttimes hold me in memory among the virtues,
  as I've learned from very many messengers,
  and bear me great friendship by right of kinship,
  I think that I will be blessed in your esteem,
  if only because I could be found worthy to be loved
  in the judgment of such a man as you.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Sed quia non is sum qui cum Panaetio interdum ab utili seiungam honestum, 
sed potius cum Tullio omni utili admisceam, 
has honestissimas atque sanctissimas amicitias nulla ex parte suo cuique utili vacare volo.
-->
  But since I am not one who, with Panaetius, sometimes excludes virtue from
  what is useful, but rather, with Cicero, mixes everything useful together,
  not in any way do I wish these upright and holy friendships to lack what is 
  useful to each.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Cumque ratio morum dicendique ratio a philosophia non separentur, 
cum studio bene vivendi semper coniunxi studium bene dicendi, 
quamvis solum bene vivere praestantius sit eo quod est bene dicere, 
curisque regiminis absoluto alteram satis sit sine altero.
-->
  And since the regard for morals and the regard for what philosophy says
  are not separate, since I have always combined the zeal for speaking
  with the zeal for living well,
  however much better it would be merely to live well than to speak well,
  for a man who is free from the cares of state,
  one would be enough without the other.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
At nobis in republica occupatis utraque necessaria.
-->
  But you possess what is necessary for us in the republic.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Nam et apposite dicere ad persuadendum et animos furentium suavi oratione ab impetu retinere, summa utilitas.
-->
  For both speaking properly in order to persuade and using pleasant speech
  to restrain the minds of those violently raging is of the highest usefulness.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Cui rei praeparandae bibliothecam assidue comparo.
-->
  And for this matter I assiduously work at preparing a library.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Et sicut Romae dudum ac in aliis partibus Italiae, 
in Germania quoque et Belgica scriptores auctorumque exemplaria multitudine nummorum redemi, 
adiutus benevolentia ac studio amicorum comprovincialium, 
sic identidem apud vos fieri ac per vos sinite ut exorem.
-->
  And just as I used to purchase, using a great deal of money,
  writings and copies of authors in Rome and in other parts of Italy,
  and also in Germany and Belgium,
  aided by the kindness and zeal of my compatriot friends,
  so allow me to persuade you that it be continually done through and with you.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quos scribi velimus in fine epistolae designabimus.
-->
  We will mark down the books that we'd like to have copied at the end of this letter. 
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Scribentibus membranas sumptusque necessarios ad vestrum imperium dirigemus, 
vestri insuper beneficii non immemores.
-->
  We will direct the needed expenses for writing the parchment to your
  authority, not heedless of your exceeding kindness.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Denique ne plura locuti legibus epistolae abutamur, 
causa tanti laboris contemptus malefidae fortunae.
-->
  Finally, let me waste no more time in speaking of law in this letter,
  the cause of so much labor.  I am despised by faithless fortune.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quem contemptum nobis non parit sola natura, ut multis, sed elaborata doctrina.
-->
  That which only nature produces is not contemptible to us, as it is to many,
  but with care bestowed on learning.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Proinde in otio, in negotio et docemus quod scimus et addiscimus quod nescimus.
-->
  Hence in leisure and in work we teach what we know and learn what we don't.
</p>

<p>END</p>
