-->
  Let the second one say:
  Which points out a child, the king of kings.

offerentes ei munera, aurum, tus, et myrrham, quia scriptum didicimus: 
"Adorabunt eum omnes reges, omnes gentes servient ei."
-->
  Then let them join together and say in unison:

Qui sint, cur veniant, quo nos rumore requirunt.

  written in the books. 
</p>

<p>
<!--
Scribae ad Herodem: 
Vidimus, domine, in prophetarum lineis nasci Christum in Bethleem,
civitate David, Isaia sic vaticinante: 
"Bethleem, non eris minima in principibus Iuda;
 ex te enim exiet dux qui regat populum meum Israel,
 ipse enim salvum faciet populum suum a peccatis eorum."
-->
  The scribes to Herod:
  We have seen, lord, in the prophets' lines that Christ is born in Bethlehem,
  the city of David, with Isaiah prophesying thus:
  "Bethlehem, you will not be least among the chief cities of Judah;
  for from you will come a leader who should rule my people of Israel,
  for he will save his people from their sins."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Herodes ad magos: Ite et de puero diligenter investigate,
Et inventum redeuntes mihi renuntiate,
Ut et ego veniens adorem eum.
-->
  Herod to the wise men: Go and scrupulously investigate the boy,
  and return and report what you've found to me,
  so that I too may go and honor him.
</p>

<p>

Pastores, dicite quidnam vidistis, et annuntiate Christi nativitatem.

-->
  The shepherds to the wise men: We saw an infant wrapped in cloths
  and choirs of angels praising the savior.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Magi: Ecce stella in oriente praevisa
Iterum praecedit nos lucida,
Quam Balaam ex Iudaica
Orituram dixerat prosapia;
Quae nostrorum oculos
Fulguranti lumine perstrinxit pavidos.
-->
  The wise men: Behold the star that we saw in the east
  again precedes us brightly,
  which Balaam had said would rise from a Jewish lineage,
  which blinds these panicstruck eyes of ours with a flashing light.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Obstetrices: Qui sunt hi qui stella duce nos adeuntes inaudita ferunt?

dona ferentes Christo regi nato Domino, quem stella deducente adorare venimus.

  bearing gifts to Christ the king the new-born Lord, whom we have come to
  honor, following a star.

Angelus: Impleta sunt omnia quae prophetice dicta sunt;
 ita via remeantes alia, ne delatores tanti regis puniendi sitis.
-->
  The angel: Everything that was said by the prophets has been fulfilled;
  so return by another road, lest you be informers of the king's so great
  vengeance.

 Natus est Christus dominator orbis in Bethleem Iudae,
 sic enim propheta dixerat ante.
