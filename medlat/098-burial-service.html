<h4>A BURIAL SERVICE</h4>

<i>
<p>
<!--
Post missam accedat sacerdos ad caput defuncti, alba indutus,
absque cappa serica; et duo clerici de secunda forma ad caput
defuncti stantes incipiant tribus vicibus antiphonam sequentem,
quam chorus singulis vicibus totam prosequatur usque in finem.
-->
  After the mass the priest, wearing an alb without a silk cassock,
  should come up to the head of the deceased;
  and two clerics of the second rank standing at the head of the deceased
  should begin the following antiphon three times,
  with the choir accompanying all it each time to the end.
</p>
</i>

<p>
<!--
Ant. Circumdederunt me gemitus mortis, dolores inferni circumdederunt me.
-->
  Ant. The groans of death enveloped me, the pains of hell enveloped me.
</p>

<i>
<p>
<!--
Deinde post tertiam repetitionem sequatur:
-->
  Then after the third repetition this should follow:
</p>
</i>

<p>
<!--
Kyrie eleyson. Christe eleyson. Kyrie eleyson.
-->
  Lord have mercy. Christ have mercy, Lord have mercy.
</p>

<i>
<p>
<!--
Non dicatur Pater noster, nec Dominus vobiscum, neque
Oremus, sed tantum Oratio, sacerdote dicente modesta voce,
videlicet sine nota:
-->
  Do not say the 'Our Father', nor 'Lord be with you', nor
  'Let us pray', but only the Oratio, with the priest speaking in a
  restrained voice, that is, without musical notes:
</p>
</i>

<p>
<!--
Non intres in iudicium cum servo tuo, Domine, quoniam
nullus apud te iustificabitur homo, nisi per te omnium peccatorum
suorum tribuatur remissio.
-->
  Do not enter into judgment with your servant, Lord, because
  no man will be justified in your presence, unless he is granted
  forgiveness for all his sins through you.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Non ergo eum, quaesumus,
tua iudicialis sententia premat, quem tibi vera supplicatio
fidei christianae commendat, sed gratia tua illi succurrente
mereatur evadere iudicium ultionis, qui dum viveret insignitus
est signaculo sanctae Trinitatis.
-->
  Therefore we ask that your judicial sentence not overwhelm him,
  whom the true supplication of Christian faith commends to you,
  but with the aid of your grace let him escape the judgment of retribution,
  he who, while living, was marked with the seal of the holy Trinity.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Per Christum Dominum nostrum. Amen.
-->
  Through Christ our Lord. Amen.
</p>

<i>
<p>
<!--
Eodem modo dicuntur omnes orationes sequentes. 
Deinde incipiat cantor responsorium:
-->
  All of the following prayers are to be said in the same way.
  Then the cantor should begin the responsory:
</p>
</i>

<p>
<!--
Qui Lazarum resuscitasti a monumento fetidum, tu eis,
Domine, dona requiem.
-->
  You who resuscitated stinking Lazarus from the tomb,
  Lord, give them rest.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Et locum indulgentiae.
-->
  And a place of indulgence.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine. Et locum.
-->
  Give them eternal rest, Lord.  And a place.
</p>

  without the "Our Father" and without "The Lord be with you; but only with
  "Let us pray".
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Oratio. Deus, cui omnia vivunt, et cui non pereunt moriendo corpora nostra, 
sed mutantur in melius, te supplices deprecamur
ut quicquid famulus tuus vitiorum tuae voluntati contrarium, fallente diabolo,
et propria iniquitate atque fragilitate contraxit, 
tu pius et misericors abluas indulgendo, eiusque animam suscipi iubeas, 
per manus sanctorum angelorum deducendam in sinum patriarcharum tuorum, 
Abraham scilicet amici tui, et Isaac electi tui, atque Iacob dilecti tui, 
quo aufugit dolor et tristitia atque suspirium, 
fidelium quoque animae felici iucunditate laetantur, 
et in novissimo magni iudicii die inter sanctos et electos tuos eam facias
perpetuae gloriae tuae percipere portionem, quam oculus non vidit, 
nec auris audivit, 
et in cor hominis non ascendit quam praeparasti diligentibus te.
-->
  Prayer. God, for whom all things live, and for whom our bodies, dying,
  do not perish but are changed for the better, we suppliants entreat you
  that whatever sins your servant, deceived by the devil
  and by his own iniquity and frailty, has entered into, contrary to your will,
  may you, holy and merciful, wash them away with your leniency
  and command that his soul be accepted,
  to be led by the hands of holy angels into the bosom of your patriarchs,
  that is, Abraham, your friend, and Isaac your chosen, and Jacob your beloved,
  where sorrow and sadness and sighing have fled.
  And where the souls of the faithful are gladdened by blessed delight,
  and in the last day of the great trial among your sanctified and your elect
  may you cause it to secure a portion of your eternal glory,
  which the eye did not see, and the ear did not hear,
  and which did not rise up in the heart of man,
  but which you have prepared for yourself with diligence.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Per Christum.
-->
  Through Christ.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Resp. Heu mihi, Domine, quia peccavi nimis in vita mea; 
quid faciam miser? Ubi fugiam nisi ad te, Deus meus?
-->
  Resp. Woe is me, Lord, because I have sinned so much in my life;
  what will I, a miserable sinner, do?
  Where will I flee, unless to you, my God?
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Miserere mei.
-->
  Have mercy on me.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Dum veneris in novissimo die.
-->
  Until you come in the last day.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Versus. Anima mea turbata est valde; sed tu, Domine, succurre ei.
-->

Dum veneris.

  and meanwhile the body should be censed as above.

</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Deinde sequatur: Kyrie eleyson, Christe eleyson, Kyrie eleyson, 
sine Pater noster, et sine Dominus vobiscum; sed tantum cum Oremus.
