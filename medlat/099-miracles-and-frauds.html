<h4>MIRACLES AND FRAUDS</h4>

<p>
<!--
De miraculis igitur quae per beati patris merita post dissolutionem
eius corporis in salutem credentium divina pietas clementer ostendit, 
melius pauca quam plura scribenda putamus,
ne aut studiosis fastidium aut desidiosis vel etiam infidelibus 
incredulitatis periculum narrationis prolixitate contrahamus.
-->
  Therefore, we think it better to write a little rather than more
  about the miracles which divine piety mercifully reveals 
  through the merits of our blessed father,
  after the dissolution of his body into salvation,
  to keep us from engaging in the scorn of students or the indolent
  or even in the danger of disbelief of the unfaithful,
  due to the extent of the narrative.
</p>

<!--
Praecipue tamen propter quasdam vanae mentis personas, 
quae in nostra patria usitato more per sacra loca discurrentes se
aut caecos aut debiles vel elingues vel certe obsessos temere simulant, 
et ante altaria vel sepulchra sanctorum se coram populo volutantes 
pugnisque tundentes sanatos se ilico proclamant,
ea scilicet sola vesana voluptate
ut sic tantum maiorem stipem vel quaestum a plebe percipiant
sicque fit ut et beatum virum saepius de talibus dixisse praemisimus:
"Quia mendaces," inquit, "faciunt ut veridicis vix credatur.
-->
  Nevertheless, particularly on account of certain empty-headed persons
  who habitually wander through sacred places in our land,
  rashly pretending to be blind or lame or mute or even possessed,
  and proclaim themselves cured on the spot in front of the altars
  or tombs of the saints in presence of people,
  rolling and beating themselves with their fists.
  Of course in the frenzied delight alone to secure
  a greater offering or gain from the common people,
  and thus it happens as we have often warned a blessed man
  to say about such things:
  "For they make deceits, so that it is scarcily credible to the honest.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Et cum in huiusmodi fallacia tales liquido deprehenduntur, 
etiam sanctorum verae virtutes in periculosam desperationem 
hac dubietate retrahuntur, vel certe et hi qui vere sanantur
etiam non solum a perfidis sed interdum a fidelibus fallere creduntur."
-->
  And when they're caught out in such a blatant trick of this sort,
  even the true virtues of the saints
  are brought back into perilous uncertainty by this doubt,
  or surely even those who are truly cured are thought to be lying,
  not only by unbelievers but sometimes even by the faithful."

<p>
<!--
Sicut utique nobis de quadam muliercula palam evenit.
-->
  At any rate, this publicly happened to us with regard to some little hussy.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Primo namque praedicti nostri antistitis Hezelini anno, 
in speciali nostra festivitate, 
id est in assumptione sanctae Mariae, anus quaedam nobis ignota,
velato capite, nubilata facie,
ante sepulchrum beati viri se proiecit ibique praedicto amentium more diutius volutata, 
tandem prosiliens se per multos annos caecam ibidem tunc illuminatam proclamavit.
-->
  For in the first year of our aforesaid bishop Hezelin,
  in our particular festivity, that is on the assumption of Saint Mary,
  a certain hag unknown to us, with her head covered and her face veiled, 
  threw herself down in front of the tomb of the blessed man and,
  after rolling for rather a long time there, in the manner of the insane,
  she finally leapt up and proclaimed herself instantly restored to sight after
  many years of blindness.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quo statim rumore diffamato, clerus populusque concurrit, 
ipse etiam episcopus advenit; 
cumque iam ad agendas publice Deo gratias properarent, 
cives illius, qui eam prius noverant 
eamque in huiusmodi falsitate saepius notaverant, venerunt, 
qui illam et modo et saepe etiam antea talia mentitam veraciter dixerunt.
-->
  And this gossip was at once spread widely -
  the clergy and people came running, even the bishop himself came;
  and when they now sped to give thanks to God in public,
  his citizens, who had known her before
  and had often observed her in that sort of deceit, came,
  and truthfully called her a deceiver both now and also so very often previously.
</p>

<p>
<!--
In quam cum iam populus merito, ut male tractaretur, 
insurgeret a clero tamen pro beati pontificis veneratione defensa,
confusa discessit, et nusquam postea comparuit.
-->
  And now the people rightly rose up against her and she was manhandled,
  but the clergy defended her due to veneration for the blessed pope.
  The troubled woman went away, and never reappeared after that.
