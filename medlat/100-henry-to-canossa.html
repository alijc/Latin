<h4>HENRY ON THE WAY TO CANOSSA</h4>

<p>
<!--
Rex Henricus in Italiam proficiscens intra Burgundiam in loco 
qui dicitur Bisenzun natalem Domini celebravit, 
satis magnifice pro sua tum calamitate susceptus et habitus
ab avunculo matris suae, Willihelmo comite,
cuius in illis locis amplissimae et florentissimae opes erant.
-->
  On his way to Italy, King Henry celebrated the birth of the Lord
  in Burgundy, in a place called Besanson
  (splendidly enough, considering his misfortune at the time),
  received and hosted by his mother's uncle, Count Wilhelmm,
  who had vast and flourishing wealth in those regions.

<!--
Ea porro causa erat ut relicto recto itinere in Burgundiam diverteret
quod certo compererat duces Ruodolfum, Welf et Bertholdum 
omnes vias omnesque aditus qui ad Italiam mittunt, 
quos vulgato nomine clusas vocant,
appositis custodibus anticipasse ut nulla illic ei copia transeundi fieret.
-->
  The reason for detouring so far out of his way was that
  he had learned with a certainty, after leaving his rule,
  that the dukes Rudolf, Welf and Berthold had already seized
  all roads and all approaches that led from Germany to Italy,
  that are commonly called passes,
  and had set guards so that Henry would be unable to cross there.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Exacta sollemnitate natalis Domini, 
profectus inde cum in locum qui Cinis dicitur venisset,
obviam habuit socrum suam filiumque eius Amadeum nomine,
quorum in illis regionibus et auctoritas clarissima 
et possessiones amplissimae et nomen celeberrimum erat.
-->
  When the ritual of the birth of the Lord was over,
  he left there and came to the place called the Cenis Pass,
  where he met his mother-in-law and her son, Amadeus by name.
  These held clear authority and great possessions and celebrated names
  in those regions.

<!--
Hi venientem honorifice susceperunt; 
transitum tamen per terminos suos alias ei concedere nolebant
nisi quinque Italiae episcopatus, possessionibus suis contiguos, 
eis redimendi itineris pretium traderet.
-->
  They received his coming with honor;
  but were unwilling to allow him passage through their territories
  on any terms other than that he surrender to them the bishopics of Italy,
  which touched on their own possessions, 
  redeemed as the price of the journey.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Durum hoc nimis atque intolerabile omnibus regis consiliariis visum est.
-->
  This seemed very hard and intolerable to all of the king's councilors.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Sed cum ei inevitabilis incumberet necessitas 
quoquo posset pacto redimendi itineris et illi 
nec iure propinquitatis nec tantae calamitatis miseratione quicquam moverentur,
multo labore et tempore in hac deliberatione insumpto, 
vix et aegre tandem impetratum est ut provinciam quandam Burgundiae, 
bonis omnibus locupletissimam, 
concedendi transitus mercedem dignarentur accipere.
-->
  But as unavoidable necessity pressed him for an agreement for saving
  his journey, by whatever means possible,
  and they were not at all moved,
  either by the right of kinship or by compassion for such a loss,
  with great toil and time spent in deliberation,
  it was finally just barely obtained that they accept
  a certain substantial province of Burgundy, with all its goods,
  as payment for allowing him passage.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Ita indignatio Domini non solum sacramentis et frequentibus beneficiis sibi
obnoxios sed etiam amicos et genere propinquos ab eo averterat.
-->
  Thus the indignation of the Lord had turned aside not only
  those subject to him by their oaths and his frequent favors to them,
  but even his friends and relatives by birth.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Difficulter assecuto transeundi licentiam protinus alia successit difficultas.
-->
  And after he gained permission to cross after this first difficulty,
  another difficulty followed at once.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Hiems erat asperrima et montes per quos transitus erat in immensum porrecti 
et paene nubibus cacumina ingerentes ita mole nivium
et glaciali frigore obriguerant ut per lubricum praecipitemque decessum 
nec equitis nec peditis gressum sine periculo admitterent.
-->
  It was a bitter winter, and the mountains to be crossed stretched endlessly
  with peaks thrusting nearly to the clouds -
  they had grown so stiff with snowdrifts and icy cold
  that they made the going down the slippery and steep descent perilous,
  either on horse or by foot.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Sed dies anniversarius quo rex in excommunicationem devenerat
e vicino imminens nullas accelerandi itineris moras patiebatur,
quia nisi ante eam diem anathemate absolveretur decretum noverat 
communi principum sententia ut et causa in perpetuum cecidisset 
et regnum sine ullo deinceps restitutionis remedio amisisset.
-->
  But since the anniversary of the day of the king's excommunication was near,
  he brooked no delay in hastening the journey out of the threatening vicinity,
  since unless he was absolved from anathema by that day he knew that a decree
  in a public sentence of princes meant that he'd lose his case and his kingdom
  for all time, with no recourse to recover them.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Igitur quosdam ex indigenis, 
locorum peritos et praeruptis Alpium iugis assuetos, 
mercede conduxit qui comitatum eius per abruptum montem et
moles nivium praecederent et subsequentibus, quaqua possent arte, 
itineris asperitatem levigarent.
-->
  And so he hired some of the locals,
  experienced with the vicinity and accustomed to the steep ridges,
  to lead his train across the precipitous mountain and snowdrifts 
  and, wherever possible, to smooth the rough road for those following them.
</p>

<p>
<!--
His ductoribus cum in verticem montis magna cum difficultate evasissent 
nulla ulterius progrediendi copia erat,
eo quod praeceps montis latus et, ut dictum est, glaciali frigore lubricum,
omnem penitus decessum negare videretur.
-->
  After these leaders had, with great difficulty,
  gotten them up to the mountain peak, there was not much further progress,
  because the mountain side was steep and, as was already said,
  slick with icy cold, every route down seemed to be completely denied them.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Ibi viri, periculum omne viribus evincere conantes,
nunc manibus et pedibus reptando, nunc ductorum suorum humeris innitendo, 
interdum quoque titubante per lubricum gressu cadendo et longius volutando, 
vix tandem aliquando cum gravi salutis suae periculo ad campestria pervenerunt.
-->
  Then the men, attempting to overcome each danger with courage,
  now crawling on hands and feet, now leaning on their guides' shoulders,
  sometimes even slipping on the ice and falling, rolling further along,
  until they finally just barely managed to reach the plains,
  with grave danger to their health.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Reginam et alias quae in obsequio eius erant mulieres, 
boum coriis impositas, duces itineris, conductu praeeuntes, deorsum trahebant.
-->
  They set the queen and the women in her service on top of cowhides -
  and their guides dragged them down the hill, preceding the train.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Equorum alios per machinas quasdam submittebant, 
alios colligatis pedibus trahebant, ex quibus multi dum traherentur mortui, 
plures debilitati, 
pauci admodum integri incolumesque periculum evadere potuerunt.
-->
  They lowered some of the horses with certain machines
  and dragged others with their feet bound,
  many of these died while they were being dragged, more were mained,
  while a very few were able to escape the danger, uninjured and unharmed.
