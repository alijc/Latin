<h4>HENRY ON THE WAY TO CANOSSA</h4>

<p>
<!--
Rex Henricus in Italiam proficiscens intra Burgundiam in loco 
qui dicitur Bisenzun natalem Domini celebravit, 
satis magnifice pro sua tum calamitate susceptus et habitus
ab avunculo matris suae, Willihelmo comite,
cuius in illis locis amplissimae et florentissimae opes erant.
-->
  On his way to Italy, King Henry celebrated the birth of the Lord
  in Burgundy, in a place called Besanson
  (splendidly enough, considering his misfortune at the time),
  received and hosted by his mother's uncle, Count Wilhelmm,
  who had vast and flourishing wealth in those regions.

<!--
Ea porro causa erat ut relicto recto itinere in Burgundiam diverteret
quod certo compererat duces Ruodolfum, Welf et Bertholdum 
omnes vias omnesque aditus qui ad Italiam mittunt, 
quos vulgato nomine clusas vocant,
appositis custodibus anticipasse ut nulla illic ei copia transeundi fieret.
-->
  The reason for detouring so far out of his way was that
  he had learned with a certainty, after leaving his rule,
  that the dukes Rudolf, Welf and Berthold had already seized
  all roads and all approaches that led from Germany to Italy,
  that are commonly called passes,
  and had set guards so that Henry would be unable to cross there.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Exacta sollemnitate natalis Domini, 
profectus inde cum in locum qui Cinis dicitur venisset,
obviam habuit socrum suam filiumque eius Amadeum nomine,
quorum in illis regionibus et auctoritas clarissima 
et possessiones amplissimae et nomen celeberrimum erat.
-->
  When the ritual of the birth of the Lord was over,
  he left there and came to the place called the Cenis Pass,
  where he met his mother-in-law and her son, Amadeus by name.
  These held clear authority and great possessions and celebrated names
  in those regions.

<!--
Hi venientem honorifice susceperunt; 
transitum tamen per terminos suos alias ei concedere nolebant
nisi quinque Italiae episcopatus, possessionibus suis contiguos, 
eis redimendi itineris pretium traderet.
-->
  They received his coming with honor;
  but were unwilling to allow him passage through their territories
  on any terms other than that he surrender to them the bishopics of Italy,
  which touched on their own possessions, 
  redeemed as the price of the journey.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Durum hoc nimis atque intolerabile omnibus regis consiliariis visum est.
-->
  This seemed very hard and intolerable to all of the king's councilors.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Sed cum ei inevitabilis incumberet necessitas 
quoquo posset pacto redimendi itineris et illi 
nec iure propinquitatis nec tantae calamitatis miseratione quicquam moverentur,
multo labore et tempore in hac deliberatione insumpto, 
vix et aegre tandem impetratum est ut provinciam quandam Burgundiae, 
bonis omnibus locupletissimam, 
concedendi transitus mercedem dignarentur accipere.
-->
  But as unavoidable necessity pressed him for an agreement for saving
  his journey, by whatever means possible,
  and they were not at all moved,
  either by the right of kinship or by compassion for such a loss,
  with great toil and time spent in deliberation,
  it was finally just barely obtained that they accept
  a certain substantial province of Burgundy, with all its goods,
  as payment for allowing him passage.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Ita indignatio Domini non solum sacramentis et frequentibus beneficiis sibi
obnoxios sed etiam amicos et genere propinquos ab eo averterat.
-->
  Thus the indignation of the Lord had turned aside not only
  those subject to him by their oaths and his frequent favors to them,
  but even his friends and relatives by birth.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Difficulter assecuto transeundi licentiam protinus alia successit difficultas.
-->
  And after he gained permission to cross after this first difficulty,
  another difficulty followed at once.
</p>

<p>END</p>
