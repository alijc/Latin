<h4>The Conversion of Lanfranc</h4>

<p>
<!--
Fuit quidam vir magnus, Italia ortus, quem Latinitas, 
in antiquum scientiae statum ab eo restituta,
tota supremum debito cum amore et honore agnoscit magistrum, nomine Lanfrancus; 
ipsa quoque in liberalibus studiis magistra gentium,
Graecia, discipulos illius libenter audiebat et admirabatur.
-->
  A certain great man, by the name of Lanfranc, who was born in Italy
  and restored good Latin style to its ancient status of knowledge,
  is recognized, with all due love and honor, as its greatest master;
  likewise Greece, the master of nations in liberal studies,
  freely heard and respected his students.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Hic Papia civitate oriundus fuit;
parentes illius, eiusdem urbis cives,
magni et honorabiles habebantur inter suos concives.
-->
  He was born in the city of Pavia;
  his parents, citizens of the same city,
  were held as great and honorable among their fellow-citizens.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Nam, ut fertur, 
pater eius de ordine illorum qui iura et leges civitatis asservabant fuit.
-->
  For, as it is said, his father was of the class of those
  who administered the laws and statutes of the city.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Lanfrancus, in primaeva aetate patre orbatus,
cum ei in honorem et dignitatem succedere deberet, 
relicta civitate amore discendi, ad studia litterarum perrexit.
-->
  At a young age Lanfranc lost his father,
  whom he ought to have succeeded in honor and dignity.
  He went on to university, abandoning his city for the love of learning.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Ibi plurimo tempore demoratus, omni scientia saeculari perfecte imbutus rediit.
-->
  He remained there for a long time, and returned with basic knowledge
  in every secular subject.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Deinde patria egressus et Alpes transgressus, in Gallias venit, 
tempore Henrici regis Francorum et gloriosi ducis Normannorum Guillelmi,
qui Angliam sibi armis subegit.
-->
  Then he left his homeland and crossed the Alps and came to Gaul,
  in the time of Henry, king of the Franks, and the famed duke of the Normans,
  William, who conquered England for himself with arms.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Et pertransiens Franciam, quam plures magni nominis scholares secum habens,
in Normanniam pervenit et, in Abrincatensi civitate demoratus, 
per aliquod tempus docuit.
-->
  And passing through France, bringing as many scholars of great
  account with him as possible, he arrived in Normandy and,
  staying in the city of Avranches, taught there for a time.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Considerans vero scientissimus vir quod captare mortalium auram vanitas est,
et quia ad non esse tendunt omnia, praeter eum qui fecit universa, 
qui semper est, et qui ei intendunt, ad obtinendum eius amorem animum convertit
et studium.
-->
  Indeed, the very learned man,
  reflecting that to attempt to gain mortal favor is foolishness,
  and since, except for He who made the universe, who is eternal,
  and those who serve him, all are bound for destruction,
  he turned his mind and zeal to obtaining His love.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quod igitur in litteris perfectius invenit salutis consilium et
placendi Deo arripere statuit, ut relictis omnibus,
abdicato etiam sui ipsius iure, ilium sequeretur qui dixit:
"Si quis vult post me venire, abneget semetipsum et tollat
crucem suam et sequatur me."
-->
  Therefore, he took the perfection that he found in literature
  and set about using it as a plan for salvation and for pleasing God,
  so that, abandoning everything, even the law itself,
  he might follow the One who said:  "If any man wishes to come after me, 
  let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Et quia quanto magnus fuerat tanto optabat fieri humilior, 
locum adire nolebat ubi litterati eum honori ac reverentiae haberent.
-->
  And since he chose, however great he'd been, to be that much more humble,
  he didn't want to go to a place where learned men might hold him
  in honor and reverence.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Interea cum ire vellet Rotomagum iter agebat, inclinata iam die,
per silvam ultra fluvium Rislam et incidit in latrones; 
qui cuncta quae habebat tollentes, ligatis a tergo manibus, 
et caputio cappae ante oculos admoto, 
abduxerunt illum de via et inter condensa saltus fruteta dimiserunt.
-->
  In the meantime, since he wished to go to Rouen, he took to the road, close to
  sunset, through the forest beyond the Risla River and fell in with robbers.
  They took all that he had, bound his hands behind his back,
  and pulled the hood of his cloak down over his eyes.
  Then they led him away from the road and left him in the dense forest undergrowth.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Talibus angustiis comprehensus, nescius quid ageret, suum infortunium lamentabatur.
-->
  Caught up in such difficult straits and not knowing what to do,
  he lamented his misfortune.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Tandem nocturno silentio in se reversus,
voluit Domino laudes debitas persolvere et non potuit, 
quia ad hoc antea non vacaverat.
-->
  At last, coming to himself in the silence of the night,
  he wished to pay to the Lord the praises due Him, but could not,
  because up to this point he had not been free to do so.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Et conversus ad Dominum: "Domine Deus," ait, "tantum tempus in discendo expendi
et corpus et animum in studiis litterarum attrivi; 
et adhuc quomodo te debeam orare atque laudis officia tibi persolvere non didici.
-->
  And turning to the Lord, he said:
  "Lord God, I have spent much time in learning,
  and have worn out body and soul in the studies of literature;
  and up til now I didn't know how to pray to you as I ought,
  or how to pay my duties of praise to you.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Libera me de hac tribulatione et ego, te auxiliante, 
sic vitam meam corrigere et instituere curabo ut tibi servire valeam et sciam."
-->
  Free me from this tribulation and I, with your aid,
  will thus take care to correct and prepare my life
  so that I might be strong and know how to serve you."
</p>

<p>
<!--
Surgente aurora, in ipso crepusculo audivit viatores iter carpentes
et coepit vociferando ab eis auxilium petere.
-->
  As dawn broke, in the fading dark he heard travelers pursuing their journey
  and began shouting, to ask them for help.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Illi audientes primo expavere, dehinc, vocem hominis advertentes, 
ad sonum vocis perrexere et quis esset, quid haberet indicavit.
-->
  When they heard him they were frightened at first, and then,
  turning their faces to the man's voice,
  proceeded to the sound of his voice and he revealed who he was, what was what.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Tunc eum solventes reduxerunt ad viam.
-->
  Then they released him and led him back to the road.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Rogavit sane ut vilius et pauperius coenobium quod in regione nossent sibi demonstrarent.
-->
  He discreetly asked them to recommend to him the meanest and poorest monastery
  that they knew of in the region.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Responderunt: "Vilius et abiectius monasterium nullum scimus quam istud 
quod in proximo aedificat quidam homo Dei," et ostendentes viam discesserunt.
-->
  They replied: "We know no meaner and humbler monastery than the one
  that a certain man of God is building very nearby," 
  and departed after showing him the way.
