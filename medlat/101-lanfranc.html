<!--
Fuit quidam vir magnus, Italia ortus, quem Latinitas, 
in antiquum scientiae statum ab eo restituta,
tota supremum debito cum amore et honore agnoscit magistrum, nomine Lanfrancus; 
ipsa quoque in liberalibus studiis magistra gentium,
Graecia, discipulos illius libenter audiebat et admirabatur.
-->
  There was a certain great man, by the name of Lanfranc, who was born in Italy
  and restored good Latin style to its ancient status of knowledge,
  is recognized, with all due love and honor, as its greatest master;
  likewise Greece, the master of nations in liberal studies,
  freely heard and respected his students.

<!--
Hic Papia civitate oriundus fuit;
parentes illius, eiusdem urbis cives,
magni et honorabiles habebantur inter suos concives.
-->
  He was born in the city of Pavia;
  his parents, citizens of the same city,
  were held as great and honorable among their fellow-citizens.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Nam, ut fertur, 
pater eius de ordine illorum qui iura et leges civitatis asservabant fuit.
-->
  For, as it is said, his father was of the class of those
  who administered the laws and statutes of the city.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Lanfrancus, in primaeva aetate patre orbatus,
cum ei in honorem et dignitatem succedere deberet, 
relicta civitate amore discendi, ad studia litterarum perrexit.
-->
  At a young age Lanfranc lost his father,
  whom he should have succeeded in honor and dignity.
  He went on to university, abandoning his city for the love of learning.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Ibi plurimo tempore demoratus, omni scientia saeculari perfecte imbutus rediit.
-->
  He remained there for a long time, and returned with basic knowledge
  in every secular subject.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Deinde patria egressus et Alpes transgressus, in Gallias venit, 
tempore Henrici regis Francorum et gloriosi ducis Normannorum Guillelmi,
qui Angliam sibi armis subegit.
-->
  From there he left his homeland and crossed the Alps and came to Gaul,
  in the time of Henry, king of the Franks, and the famed duke of the Normans,
  William, who conquered England for himself with arms.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Et pertransiens Franciam, quam plures magni nominis scholares secum habens,
in Normanniam pervenit et, in Abrincatensi civitate demoratus, 
per aliquod tempus docuit.
-->
  And passing through France, bringing as many scholars of great
  account with him as possible, he arrived in Normandy and,
  staying in the city of Avranches, taught there for a time.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Considerans vero scientissimus vir quod captare mortalium auram vanitas est,
et quia ad non esse tendunt omnia, praeter eum qui fecit universa, 
qui semper est, et qui ei intendunt, ad obtinendum eius amorem animum convertit
et studium.
-->
  Indeed, the most knowledgeable man considering that to attempt to gain
  mortal favor is foolishness,
  and since, except for He who made the universe, who is eternal,
  and those who serve him, all are bound for destruction,
  he turned his mind and zeal to obtaining His love.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quod igitur in litteris perfectius invenit salutis consilium et
placendi Deo arripere statuit, ut relictis omnibus,
abdicato etiam sui ipsius iure, ilium sequeretur qui dixit:
"Si quis vult post me venire, abneget semetipsum et tollat
crucem suam et sequatur me."
-->
  Therefore, he took the perfection that he found in literature
  and set about using it as a plan for salvation and for pleasing God,
  so that, abandoning everything, even the law itself,
  he might follow the One who said:
  "If any man wishes to come after me, let him deny himself and take up
  his cross and follow me."
