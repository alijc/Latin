<h4>The Vision of Anselm</h4>

<p>
<!--
At Anselmus filius horum cum puer parvulus esset maternis, 
prout aetas sua patiebatur, colloquiis libenter animum intendebat.
-->
  Now when their son Anselm was a small boy, he happily stretched his mind
  with conversations with his mother, as much as his age permitted.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Et audito unum Deum sursum in caelo esse omnia regentem, omnia continentem,
suspicatus est, utpote puer inter montes nutritus, caelum montibus incumbere, 
in quo et aulam Dei esse eamque per montes adiri posse.
-->
  And when he heard that God on high in heaven solely guided and maintained
  everything, he supposed, like a boy raised in the mountains,
  that heaven, where the palace of God was, was supported by the mountains,
  that he could get to it through the mountains. 
</p>

<p>
<!--
Cumque hoc saepius animo volveret, contigit ut quadam nocte per visum videret
se debere montis cacumen ascendere et ad aulam magni regis Dei properare.
-->
  And after he rolled this thought about in his mind for a while,
  it happened that one night he had a vision, that he should climb the mountain
  peak and hasten to the palace of the great king, God.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Verum priusquam montem coepisset ascendere,
vidit in planitie qua pergebat ad pedem montis mulieres,
quae regis erant ancillae, segetes metere, 
sed hoc nimis neglegenter faciebant et desidiose.
-->
  Indeed before he got to the foot of the mountain and began to climb,
  and was still on the plain, he saw women, servants of the king, reaping grain,
  but they did this overly heedlessly and indolently.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Quarum desidiam puer docens atque redarguens proposuit 
animo se apud Dominum regem ipsas accusaturum.
-->
  And the boy, noticing and disapproving of their idleness,
  proposed in his mind that he must accuse them before the Lord the king.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Dehinc monte transcenso, regiam aulam subiit, Deum cum solo suo dapifero invenit.
-->
  Then he climbed the mountain and entered the royal palace,
  and found God alone with his steward.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Nam familiam suam, ut sibi videbatur, quoniam autumnus erat, ad colligendas messes miserat.
-->
  For since it was autumn, it seemed a good idea to him to send his household
  to harvest the crops.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Ingrediens itaque puer a Domino vocatur.
-->
  And so the boy went in and was summoned by the Lord.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Accedit atque ad pedes eius sedet.
-->
  He came near and sat at his feet.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Interrogatur iucunda affabilitate quis sit vel unde, quidque velit.
-->
  He was questioned with pleasant courtesy who he was and from where, and
  what he wished.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Respondet ille ad interrogata iuxta quod rem esse sciebat.
-->
  He replied to the questions as well as he knew how to.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Tunc ad imperium Dei panis ei nitidissimus per dapiferum affertur eoque coram ipso reficitur.
-->
  Then at God's command shining white bread was brought to him by the steward
  and he restored himself with it in God's presence.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Mane igitur cum quid viderit ante oculos mentis reduceret,
sicut puer simplex et innocens,
se veraciter in caelo et ex pane Dei refectum fuisse credebat,
hocque coram aliis ita esse publice asserebat.
-->
  And so in the morning when he recalled what he had seen before his eyes,
  he believed, as a simple and innocent boy,
  that he really had been in heaven and had been restored by God's bread,
  and he asserted this publicly before others.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Crevit ergo puer et ab omnibus diligebatur.
-->
  Then the boy grew up and was loved by all.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Mores etenim probi in eo erant qui magnopere illum diligi faciebant.
-->
  For he had an honest character which made him greatly loved.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Traditur litteris, discit, et in brevi plurimum proficit.
-->
  He is given over to his letters, he learns, and accomplishes a great deal in a
  short time.
