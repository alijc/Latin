<h4>Anselm on Discipline</h4>
 
<p>START</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Quodam igitur tempore cum quidam abbas, qui admodum religiosus habebatur,
    secum de iis quae monasticae religionis erant loqueretur,
    ac inter alia de pueris in claustro nutritis verba consereret, adiecit:
    "Quid, obsecro, fiet de istis?
-->
  And so, once when a certain abbot, who was held as exceedingly devout,
  was speaking with him about women who were religious monastics,
  and they were conversing about the children raised in the monastery,
  he added: "What, I pray, is to be done about them?"
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Perversi sunt et incorrigibiles, die et nocte non cessamus eos verberantes,
    et semper fiunt sibi ipsis deteriores."
-->
  They have been subverted and are incorrigible,
  we don't leave off beating them, day and night,
  and they always become worse than before."
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Ad quae miratus Anselmus: "Non cessatis," inquit, "eos verberare?
-->
  At which Anselm was amazed: "You don't leave off," he said, "beating them?
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Et cum adulti sunt, quales sunt?"
-->
  And when they have grown up, what sort are they?"
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    "Hebetes," inquit, "et bestiales."
-->
  "Stupid," he said, "and brutish."
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    At ille: "Quam bono omine nutrimentum vestrum expenditis?
-->
  But he said: "With what profit do you spend your substance?
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    De hominibus bestias nutrivistis."
-->
  You rear beasts from men."
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    "Et nos," ait, "quid possumus inde?
-->
  "And we," he said, "what can we do then?
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Modis omnibus constringimus eos ut proficiant et nihil proficimus."
-->
  We restrain them in every way so they can succeed and we accomplish nothing."
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    "Constringitis?
-->
  "You restrain them?
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Dic mihi, quaeso, domine abba, si plantam arboris in horto tuo plantares
    et mox illam omni ex parte ita concluderes
    ut ramos suos nullatenus extendere posset,
    cum eam post annos excluderes qualis arbor inde prodiret?
-->
  Tell me, I ask, lord abbot, if you plant a sapling in your garden and then
  confine it in every way thus, so that it can't extend its branches at all,
  when you liberate it years later, what sort of tree would issue from this?
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Profecto inutilis, incurvis ramis et perplexis.
-->
  Surely a useless one, with crooked and tangled branches.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Et hoc ex cuius culpa procederet nisi tua, qui eam immoderate conclusisti?
-->
  And who would be at blame for this except for you,
  who immoderately confined it?
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Certe hoc facitis de pueris vestris;
    plantati sunt per oblationem in horto ecclesiae
    ut crescant et fructificent Deo.
-->
  Surely this is what you do with your children;
  they were planted in the church's garden as an oblate,
  to grow and bear fruit for God.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Vos autem in tantum terroribus,
    minis et verberibus undique illos coartatis
    ut nulla penitus sibi liceat libertate potiri.
-->
  But you so alarmingly restrict them with threats and beatings on every side
  so that, deep down, they are not able to master their own liberty.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Itaque indiscrete oppressi pravas et spinarum more perplexas infra se
    cogitationes congerunt, fovent, nutriunt,
    tantaque eas vi nutriendo suffulciunt
    ut omnia quae illarum correctioni possent adminiculari obstinata mente subterfugiant.
-->
  And so, unwisely suppressed, they amass opinions among themselves
  that are crooked and tangled as if with thorns; they maintain, nourish,
  and foster these with such strength for nourishment as to obstinately evade
  anything that could be applied to correcting these opinions. 
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Unde fit ut quia nihil amoris, nihil pietatis, nihil benevolentiae,
    sive dulcedinis circa se in vobis sentiunt,
    nec illi alicuius in vobis boni postea fidem habeant,
    sed omnia vestra ex odio et invidia contra se procedere credant.
-->
  From this, because they sense in you no love, no tenderness, no kindness, or
  sweetness for themselves, it results that they won't credit you
  for any good afterwards, but will believe that all your actions against them
  come from hatred and spite. 
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Contingitque modo miserabili ut, sicut deinceps corpore crescunt,
    sic in eis odium et suspicio omnis mali crescat,
    semper proni et incurvi ad vitia.
-->
  And it wretchedly happens that, as one by one they grow in body,
  so hatred and suspicion of every evil grows in them,
  forever crooked and prone to sin.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Cumque ad nullum in vera fuerint caritate nutriti,
    nullum nisi depressis superciliis oculove obliquo valent intueri.
-->
  And since they have truly been nourished with charity towards no-one,
  they deign to look at no-one except with glowering brows or a side-eye.
</p>
