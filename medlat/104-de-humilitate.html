<h4>On Humility</h4>

<p>
<!--
    Principium autem disciplinae humilitas est, cuius cum multa sint documenta,
    haec tria praecipue ad lectorem pertinent.
-->
  But the first principle of education is humility.
  There are many examples of this,
  especially these three that apply to the reader.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Primum ut nullam scientiam, nullam scripturam vilem teneat;
    secundum ut a nemine discere erubescat;
    tertium ut cum scientiam adeptus fuerit, ceteros non contemnat.
-->
  First, that he hold no knowledge, no writing, as worthless;
  second, that he not be ashamed to learn from anyone;
  third, that after he has gained knowledge, he not hold others in contempt.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Multos hoc decepit, quod ante tempus sapientes videri volunt.
-->
  This has duped many men, because they wish to seem wise before their time.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Hinc namque in quendam elationis tumorem prorumpunt,
    ut iam et simulare incipiant quod non sunt et quod sunt erubescere,
    eoque longius a sapientia recedunt quod non esse sapientes
    sed putari volunt.
-->
  For it makes them break out in a swelling of pride, as they now start to
  pretend to be what they are not and to feel shame for what they are,
  and so slide further from wisdom
  because they wish not to be wise, but to be thought wise. 
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Cuiusmodi multos novi qui, cum primis adhuc elementis indigeant,
    non nisi summis interesse dignantur,
    et ex hoc solummodo se magnos fieri putant
    si magnorum et sapientium vel scripta legerint vel audierint verba.
-->
  I have known many this sort who, although they yet lack the first principles,
  condescend to take part in nothing except the highest matters,
  and from this alone they think that they have become great
  if they have read writings or heard speeches of those great and wise.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    "Nos," inquiunt, "vidimus illos, nos ab illis legimus.
-->
  "We," they say, "have seen those men, we have read from them.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Saepe nobis loqui solebant.
-->
  They often used to speak to us.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Illi summi, illi famosi, cognoverunt nos."
-->
  Those very great men, those famous ones, they recognized us."
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Sed utinam me nemo cognoscat et ego cuncta noverim.
-->
  But would that no one would recgonize me and I should know everything.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Platonem vidisse, non intellexisse gloriamini;
    puto indignum vobis est deinceps ut me audiatis.
-->
  You boast that you have seen Plato, not that you have understood him;
  I think it beneath you to listen to me after that.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Non ego sum Plato, nec Platonem videre merui;
    sufficit vobis quod ipsum philosophiae fontem potastis,
    sed utinam adhuc sitiretis.
-->
  I am not Plato, nor do I deserve to see Plato;
  it's enough for you that you have drunk from that fount of philosophy,
  but would that you were still thirsty.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Rex post aurea pocula de vase bibit testeo.
-->
  After a golden bowl, the king drinks from an earthenware vessel.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Quid erubescitis?
-->
  What are you ashamed of?
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Platonem audistis, audietis et Chrysippum.
-->
  You have heard Plato, and you will hear Chrysippus.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    In proverbio dicitur: "Quod tu non nosti fortassis novit asellus."
-->
  In the proverb it is said: "Perhaps an ass knows what you do not."
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Nemo est cui omnia scire datum sit,
    nec quisquam rursum cui aliquid spirituale a natura accepisse non contigerit.
-->
  There is no man to whom it was given to know everything, nor in turn did it
  ever befall anyone to learn nothing of the spirit from nature.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Prudens igitur lector omnes libenter audit, omnia legit;
    non scripturam, non personam, non doctrinam spernit.
-->
  Therefore, the prudent reader willingly listens to all men, reads everything;
  he does not spurn any writing, or person, or doctrine.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Indifferenter ab omnibus quod sibi deesse videt quaerit;
    nec quantum sciat sed quantum ignoret considerat.
-->
  He seeks from all men impartially what he sees that he himself lacks;
  he considers, not how much he knows, but how much he does not.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Hinc illud Platonicum aiunt:
    "Malo aliena verecunde discere quam mea impudenter ingerere."
-->
  From this they repeat the saying of Plato:
  "I'd rather learn another's views modestly than shamelessly pour out my own."
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Cur discere erubescis et nescire non verecundaris?
-->
  Why are you ashamed to learn and feel no shame about not knowing?
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Pudor iste maior est illo.
-->
  This shame of yours is greater than the other shame.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Aut quid summa affectas cum tu iaceas in imo?
-->
  Or why do you strive for the heights when you lie at the very bottom?
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Considera potius quid vires tuae ferre valeant.
-->
  Consider rather what your strength would be enough to do.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Aptissime incedit qui incedit ordinate.
-->
  He who advances methodically advances most suitably.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Quidam dum magnum saltum facere volunt praecipitium incidunt.
-->
  Some people who want to make a great leap just fall headlong.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Noli ergo nimis festinare; hoc modo citius ad sapientiam pertinges.
-->
  Therefore don't hurry; in this way you'll get to wisdom faster.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Ab omnibus libenter disce quod tu nescis,
    quia humilitas commune tibi facere potest quod natura cuique proprium fecit;
    sapientior omnibus eris si ab omnibus discere volueris.
-->
  Willingly learn what you do not know from everyone,
  since humility can make common for you what nature make proper for anyone;
  you'll be wiser than them all if you're willing to learn from everyone.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Qui ab omnibus accipiunt omnibus ditiores sunt.
-->
  And those who receive from everyone are richer than everyone else.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Nullam denique scientiam vilem teneas quia omnis scientia bona est.
-->
  Finally, hold no knowledge as worthless, for all knowledge is good.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Si omnia legere non potes, ea quae sunt utiliora lege.
-->
  If you cannot read everything, read what is more useful.
</p>

<p>
<!--
  Etiam si omnia legere potueris, non omnibus tamen idem labor impendendus est,
  sed quaedam ita legenda sunt ne sint incognita, quaedam vero ne sint inaudita,
  quia aliquando pluris esse credimus quod non audivimus
  et facilius existimatur res cuius fructus agnoscitur.
-->
  Even if you read everything, the same toil shouldn't be spent on each,
  but certain things ought to be read lest they be unknown,
  indeed some things lest they be unheard of,
  since sometimes we trust what we have not heard the more,
  and a matter is more easily valued if its benefit is recognized.
</p>

<p>
<!--
  Videre nunc potes quam necessaria tibi sit haec humilitas
  ut nullam scientiam vili pendas et ab omnibus libenter discas. 
-->
  You can now see how this humility might be necessary for you
  to consider no knowledge as worthless and to willingly learn from all.
</p>

 
<p>START</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Similiter tibi quoque expedit ut, cum tu aliquid sapere coeperis,
    ceteros non contemnas.
-->
  Similarly, as you begin to understand something,
  humility also prepares you to not scorn everything else.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Hoc autem tumoris vitium hinc quibusdam accidit,
    quod suam scientiam nimis diligenter inspiciunt,
    et cum sibi aliquid esse visi fuerint alios quos non noverunt
    tales nec esse nec potuisse fieri putant.
-->
  But this fault of swollen pride from this happens to some people
  because they consider their own knowledge too well,
  and when they seem to themselves to be something
  they think that others, whom they don't know,
  can neither be nor be made as great.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
  Hinc etiam ebullit quod nugigeruli nunc quidam nescio unde gloriantes
  priores patres simplicitatis arguunt, et secum natam, secum morituram
  credunt sapientiam.
-->
  Yet from this comes out that now certain worthless fellows (I know not
  from where) pridefully charge the elder fathers with simplicity,
  and they believe that wisdom was born with them, and will die with them.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
  In divinis eloquiis ita simplicem modum loquendi esse aiunt
  ut in eis magistros audire non oporteat;
  posse satis quemque proprio ingenio veritatis arcana penetrare.
-->
  They say that divine pronouncements they speak in such a simple way
  that it's not necessary to listen to teachers in regards to them;
  that anyone can use their own talent to penetrate the secrets of truth.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
  Corrugant nasum et valgium torquent in lectores divinitatis,
  et non intellegunt quod Deo iniuriam faciunt,
  cuius verba pulchro quidem vocabulo simplicia
  sed sensu pravo insipida praedicant.
-->
  They turn up their noses and twist their lips at lecturers of divinity,
  not realizing that they themselves insult God, whose words they preach,
  simple words in a truly beautiful name but tasteless in a perverse sense.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
  Bonus lector humilis debet esse et mansuetus,
  a curis inanibus et voluptatum inlecebris prorsus alienus,
  diligens et sedulus, ut ab omnibus libenter discat,
  numquam de scientia sua praesumat,
  perversi dogmatis auctores quasi venena fugiat,
  diu rem pertrectare antequam iudicet discat,
  non videri doctus sed esse discat vel quaerat,
  dicta sapientium intellecta diligat,
  et ea semper coram oculis quasi speculum vultus sui tenere studeat.
-->
  A good reader ought to be humble and gentle,
  entirely unaffected by vain concerns and the charms of pleasure,
  diligent and painstaking, to willingly learn from everyone,
  to never presume about one's own knowlege,
  to flee the authors of preverse doctrine like poison,
  to study something for a long time before judging it,
  to seek to learn not to seem learned but to be so,
  to hold dear the sayings of the wise that he has understood,
  and to always strive to hold them before his eyes like a mirror of his face.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
  Et si qua forte obscuriora intellectum eius non admiserint,
  non statim in vituperium prorumpat
  ut nihil bonum esse credat nisi quod ipse intellegere potuit.
-->
  And if by some obscure chance they do let him comprehend them,
  let him not immediately break out in reproach
  and believe that nothing is good except what he himself can understand.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
  Haec est humilitas disciplinae legentium.
-->
  This is the humility for the discipline of the readers.
</p>
