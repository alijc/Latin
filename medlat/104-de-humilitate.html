<h4>On Humility</h4>

<p>
<!--
    Principium autem disciplinae humilitas est, cuius cum multa sint documenta,
    haec tria praecipue ad lectorem pertinent.
-->
  But the first principle of education is humility.
  There are many examples of this,
  especially these three that apply to the reader.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Primum ut nullam scientiam, nullam scripturam vilem teneat;
    secundum ut a nemine discere erubescat;
    tertium ut cum scientiam adeptus fuerit, ceteros non contemnat.
-->
  First, that he hold no knowledge, no writing, as worthless;
  second, that he not be ashamed to learn from anyone;
  third, that after he has gained knowledge, he not hold others in contempt.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Multos hoc decepit, quod ante tempus sapientes videri volunt.
-->
  This has duped many men, because they wish to seem wise before their time.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Hinc namque in quendam elationis tumorem prorumpunt,
    ut iam et simulare incipiant quod non sunt et quod sunt erubescere,
    eoque longius a sapientia recedunt quod non esse sapientes
    sed putari volunt.
-->
  For it makes them break out in a swelling of pride, as they now start to
  pretend to be what they are not and to feel shame for what they are,
  and so slide further from wisdom
  because they wish not to be wise, but to be thought wise. 
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Cuiusmodi multos novi qui, cum primis adhuc elementis indigeant,
    non nisi summis interesse dignantur,
    et ex hoc solummodo se magnos fieri putant
    si magnorum et sapientium vel scripta legerint vel audierint verba.
-->
  I have known many this sort who, although they yet lack the first principles,
  condescend to take part in nothing except the highest matters,
  and from this alone they think that they have become great
  if they have read writings or heard speeches of those great and wise.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    "Nos," inquiunt, "vidimus illos, nos ab illis legimus.
-->
  "We," they say, "have seen those men, we have read from them.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Saepe nobis loqui solebant.
-->
  They often used to speak to us.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Illi summi, illi famosi, cognoverunt nos."
-->
  Those very great men, those famous ones, they recognized us."
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Sed utinam me nemo cognoscat et ego cuncta noverim.
-->
  But would that no one would recgonize me and I should know everything.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Platonem vidisse, non intellexisse gloriamini;
    puto indignum vobis est deinceps ut me audiatis.
-->
  You boast that you have seen Plato, not that you have understood him;
  I think it beneath you to listen to me after that.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Non ego sum Plato, nec Platonem videre merui;
    sufficit vobis quod ipsum philosophiae fontem potastis,
    sed utinam adhuc sitiretis.
-->
  I am not Plato, nor do I deserve to see Plato;
  it's enough for you that you have drunk from that fount of philosophy,
  but would that you were still thirsty.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Rex post aurea pocula de vase bibit testeo.
-->
  After a golden bowl, the king drinks from an earthenware vessel.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Quid erubescitis?
-->
  What are you ashamed of?
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Platonem audistis, audietis et Chrysippum.
-->
  You have heard Plato, and you will hear Chrysippus.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    In proverbio dicitur: "Quod tu non nosti fortassis novit asellus."
-->
  In the proverb it is said: "Perhaps an ass knows what you do not."
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Nemo est cui omnia scire datum sit,
    nec quisquam rursum cui aliquid spirituale a natura accepisse non contigerit.
-->
  There is no man to whom it was given to know everything, nor in turn did it
  ever befall anyone to learn nothing of the spirit from nature.
</p>

 
<p>START</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Prudens igitur lector omnes libenter audit, omnia legit;
    non scripturam, non personam, non doctrinam spernit.
-->
  Therefore, the prudent reader willingly listens to all men, reads everything;
  he does not spurn any writing, or person, or doctrine.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Indifferenter ab omnibus quod sibi deesse videt quaerit;
    nec quantum sciat sed quantum ignoret considerat.
-->
  He seeks from all men impartially what he sees that he himself lacks;
  he considers, not how much he knows, but how much he does not.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Hinc illud Platonicum aiunt:
    "Malo aliena verecunde discere quam mea impudenter ingerere."
-->
  From this they repeat the saying of Plato:
  "I'd rather learn another's views modestly than shamelessly pour out my own."
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Cur discere erubescis et nescire non verecundaris?
-->
  Why are you ashamed to learn and feel no shame about not knowing?
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Pudor iste maior est illo.
-->
  This shame of yours is greater than the other shame.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Aut quid summa affectas cum tu iaceas in imo?
-->
  Or what do you strive for the most when you lie at the very bottom?
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Considera potius quid vires tuae ferre valeant.
-->
  Consider rather what your strength would be enough to bear.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Aptissime incedit qui incedit ordinate.
-->
  He who advances methodically advances most suitably.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Quidam dum magnum saltum facere volunt praecipitium incidunt.
-->
  Some people who want to make a great leap just fall headlong.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Noli ergo nimis festinare; hoc modo citius ad sapientiam pertinges.
-->
  Therefore I am very much unwilling to hurry;
  in this way you'll get to wisdom faster.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Ab omnibus libenter disce quod tu nescis,
    quia humilitas commune tibi facere potest quod natura cuique proprium fecit;
    sapientior omnibus eris si ab omnibus discere volueris.
-->
  Be willing to learn what you do not know from everyone,
  since humility can do for you in general what nature did for anyone in particular;
  you'll be wiser than them all if you're willing to learn from everyone.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Qui ab omnibus accipiunt omnibus ditiores sunt.
-->
  And those who get from all are richer than everyone.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Nullam denique scientiam vilem teneas quia omnis scientia bona est.
-->
  Finally, may you hold no knowledge as worthless, for all knowledge is good.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Si omnia legere non potes, ea quae sunt utiliora lege.
-->
  If you cannot read everything, read what is more useful.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
  Etiam si omnia legere potueris, non omnibus tamen idem labor impendendus est,
  sed quaedam ita legenda sunt ne sint incognita, quaedam vero ne sint inaudita,
  quia aliquando pluris esse credimus quod non audivimus
  et facilius existimatur res cuius fructus agnoscitur.
-->
  Even if you read everything, the same toil shouldn't be expended to them all,
  but certain things ought to be read lest they be unknown,
  indeed some things lest they be unheard of,
  since sometimes we believe there is more that we did not hear
  and a matter is reckoned easier if its benefit is recognized.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
  Videre nunc potes quam necessaria tibi sit haec humilitas
  ut nullam scientiam vili pendas et ab omnibus libenter discas. 
-->
  You can now see how this humility might be necessary for you
  to consider no knowledge as worthless and to willingly learn from all.
</p>
