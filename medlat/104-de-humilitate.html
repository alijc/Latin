<h4>On Humility</h4>
 
<p>START</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Principium autem disciplinae humilitas est, cuius cum multa sint documenta,
    haec tria praecipue ad lectorem pertinent.
-->
  But the first part of education is humility.
  There are many examples of this,
  especially these three that pertain to the reader.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Primum ut nullam scientiam, nullam scripturam vilem teneat;
    secundum ut a nemine discere erubescat;
    tertium ut cum scientiam adeptus fuerit, ceteros non contemnat.
-->
  First, that he hold no knowledge, no writing, as worthless;
  second, that he not be ashamed to learn from anyone;
  third, that after he has gained knowledge, he not hold others in contempt.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Multos hoc decepit, quod ante tempus sapientes videri volunt.
-->
  This deceives many men, because they wish to seem wise before their time.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Hinc namque in quendam elationis tumorem prorumpunt,
    ut iam et simulare incipiant quod non sunt et quod sunt erubescere,
    eoque longius a sapientia recedunt quod non esse sapientes
    sed putari volunt.
-->
  For it makes them break out in a swelling of pride, as they now start to
  pretend to be what they are not and to feel shame for what they are,
  and so slide further from wisdom
  because they wish not to be wise, but to be thought wise. 
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Cuiusmodi multos novi qui, cum primis adhuc elementis indigeant,
    non nisi summis interesse dignantur,
    et ex hoc solummodo se magnos fieri putant
    si magnorum et sapientium vel scripta legerint vel audierint verba.
-->
  I have known many this sort who, although they yet lack the first principles,
  condescend to take part in nothing except the highest points,
  and from this alone they think that they have become great
  if they have read writings or heard speeches of those greater and wiser.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    "Nos," inquiunt, "vidimus illos, nos ab illis legimus.
-->
  "We," they say, "saw those men, we have read from them.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Saepe nobis loqui solebant.
-->
  They often used to speak to us.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Illi summi, illi famosi, cognoverunt nos."
-->
  Those very great men, those famous ones, they recognized us."
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Sed utinam me nemo cognoscat et ego cuncta noverim.
-->
  But would that no one would recgonize me and I would know everything.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Platonem vidisse, non intellexisse gloriamini;
    puto indignum vobis est deinceps ut me audiatis.
-->
  You boast that you have seen Plato, not that you have understood him;
  I think it beneath you to listen to me after that.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Non ego sum Plato, nec Platonem videre merui;
    sufficit vobis quod ipsum philosophiae fontem potastis,
    sed utinam adhuc sitiretis.
-->
  I am not Plato, nor do I deserve to see Plato;
  it's enough for you that you have drunk from that fount of philosophy,
  but would that you were still thirsty.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Rex post aurea pocula de vase bibit testeo.
-->
  After the golden bowl, the king drinks from an earthenware vessel.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Quid erubescitis?
-->
  What are you ashamed of?
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Platonem audistis, audietis et Chrysippum.
-->
  You have heard Plato, and you will hear Chrysippus.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    In proverbio dicitur: "Quod tu non nosti fortassis novit asellus."
-->
  In the proverb it is said: "Perhaps an ass knows what you do not."
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Nemo est cui omnia scire datum sit,
    nec quisquam rursum cui aliquid spirituale a natura accepisse non contigerit.
-->
  There is no man to whom it was given to know everything, nor in turn did it
  ever befall anyone to learn anything of the spirit from nature.
</p>
