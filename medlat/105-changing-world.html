<h4>The Changing World</h4>
 
<p>START</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Considerare Dei iudicia mundique volubilitatem etiam nolentes compellimur.
-->
  We are compelled, albeit unwillingly,
  to consider the justice of God and the volatility of the world. 
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Ecce enim, ut supra dixi, in modum caeli,
    quod ab oriente ad occidentem vertitur,
    simul cum tempore res mundanas rerumque potestates volvi cernimus.
-->
  For look, as I have said before, at the way of heaven,
  that turns from east to west,
  so with time we see that worldly things and the powers of things revolve.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Et ne putaremus mortales res in aliqua mundi parte statum invenisse,
    ibi etiam defectum eas pati ac more febricitantis, sicut in Iob habes:
    "Noctem verterunt in diem et rursum post tenebras spero lucem,"
    quocumque se verterint nihil stabilitatis
    habentes dolores ac labores repperisse conspicimus.
-->
  And lest we suppose that mortal matters are found firm in any part of the world,
  there yet they suffer weakness and in the manner of feverishness,
  as you have in Job:
  "They turn night into day and after darkness I again look for light,"
  wherever they may turn
  we observe that they have sorrrow and toil but have learned nothing of stability.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Nonne videtur tibi more, ut dixi,
    febricitantis mundialis dignitas volvi ac revolvi?
-->
  Doesn't it seem to you to move, as I said,
  that the position of the feverishness of the world is rolled this way and that?
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Febricitantes enim spem quietis in alternatione situs ponunt
    ideoque crebris revolutionibus quando torquentur se iactant huc et illuc.
-->
  For feverishness I hope toby restful in alternative of situation they put
  and therefore toby repeated revolutions when they are turned they disturb
  themselves here and there.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Ita nimirum potestas temporalis a Babylone devoluta ad Medos,
    inde ad Persas, post ad Graecos, ad ultimum ad Romanos
    et sub Romano nomine ad Francos translata est.
-->
  Thus too much temporal power from Babylon having rolled down to the Medes,
  from there to the Persions, after that to the Greeks, and ultimately to the
  Romans and under the Roman name was transferred to the French.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Ubi dum, tamquam firmam sedem fixisset, mansura videretur,
    tot malis (ut in superioribus patet) subiacere coepit
    ut merito cum Iob dicere possit:
    "Cum ad diem venero, nocturnis cruciatibus fatigatus, noctem praestolor,
    quam dum tenuero, maioribus doloribus affectus, rursum diem venire exopto."
-->
  Where/when while/until, so to speak, it had molded a firm seat, it might seem
  gonna remain, so many toby evil (as in higher ones if lies open) it began to
  lie underneath so that deservedly with Job one might say:
  "As I come to the day, worn out be nocturnal tortures, I await the night,
  which while/until I master, impaired by greater sorrow, again I long for the
  day to come."
</p>

<p>END</p>
