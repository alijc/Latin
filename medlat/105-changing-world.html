<h4>The Changing World</h4>

<p>
<!--
Considerare Dei iudicia mundique volubilitatem etiam nolentes compellimur.
-->
  We are compelled, albeit unwillingly,
  to consider the justice of God and the volatility of the world. 
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Ecce enim, ut supra dixi, in modum caeli,
    quod ab oriente ad occidentem vertitur,
    simul cum tempore res mundanas rerumque potestates volvi cernimus.
-->
  For look, as I said before, in the manner of the sky,
  that turns from east to west,
  we see that worldly things and the powers that be turn just like time.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Et ne putaremus mortales res in aliqua mundi parte statum invenisse,
    ibi etiam defectum eas pati ac more febricitantis, sicut in Iob habes:
    "Noctem verterunt in diem et rursum post tenebras spero lucem,"
    quocumque se verterint nihil stabilitatis
    habentes dolores ac labores repperisse conspicimus.
-->
  We shouldn't suppose that mortal matters are found to be firm in any part of
  the world, but that they suffer from weakness and a sort of feverishness,
  as you have in Job:
  "They turn night into day and after the darkness I again look for the light,"
  wherever they may turn we observe that they have no stability but
  have landed on sorrow and toil.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Nonne videtur tibi more, ut dixi,
    febricitantis mundialis dignitas volvi ac revolvi?
-->
  Doesn't it usually seem to you, as I said, that the character of the
  feverishness of the world turns and turns again?
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Febricitantes enim spem quietis in alternatione situs ponunt
    ideoque crebris revolutionibus quando torquentur se iactant huc et illuc.
-->
  For the feverish put their hope for rest in change and so when they
  turn in frequent revolutions they throw themselves this way and that. 
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Ita nimirum potestas temporalis a Babylone devoluta ad Medos,
    inde ad Persas, post ad Graecos, ad ultimum ad Romanos
    et sub Romano nomine ad Francos translata est.
-->
  Thus without doubt temporal power rolled down from Babylon to the Medes,
  from there to the Persians, after that to the Greeks, and ultimately to the
  Romans and under the name of Rome was transferred to the French.

    Ubi dum, tamquam firmam sedem fixisset, mansura videretur,
    tot malis (ut in superioribus patet) subiacere coepit
    ut merito cum Iob dicere possit:
    "Cum ad diem venero, nocturnis cruciatibus fatigatus, noctem praestolor,
    quam dum tenuero, maioribus doloribus affectus, rursum diem venire exopto."
-->
  Until it was as if it had fixed a firm seat, and seemed well settled,
  but began to sink under so many evils (as is plain to our elders)
  that one might deservedly say, with Job:
  "As I come to the day, worn out be nocturnal tortures, I await the night,
  but while I hold it, affected by a greater sorrow, I again long for the
  day to come."
