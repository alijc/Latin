<h4>The Changing World</h4>

<p>
<!--
Considerare Dei iudicia mundique volubilitatem etiam nolentes compellimur.
-->
  We are compelled, albeit unwillingly,
  to consider the justice of God and the volatility of the world. 
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Ecce enim, ut supra dixi, in modum caeli,
    quod ab oriente ad occidentem vertitur,
    simul cum tempore res mundanas rerumque potestates volvi cernimus.
-->
  For look, as I said before, in the manner of the sky,
  that turns from east to west,
  we see that worldly things and the powers that be turn just like time.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Et ne putaremus mortales res in aliqua mundi parte statum invenisse,
    ibi etiam defectum eas pati ac more febricitantis, sicut in Iob habes:
    "Noctem verterunt in diem et rursum post tenebras spero lucem,"
    quocumque se verterint nihil stabilitatis
    habentes dolores ac labores repperisse conspicimus.
-->
  We shouldn't suppose that mortal matters are found to be firm in any part of
  the world, but that they suffer from weakness and a sort of feverishness,
  as you have in Job:
  "They turn night into day and after the darkness I again look for the light,"
  wherever they may turn we observe that they have no stability but
  have landed on sorrow and toil.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Nonne videtur tibi more, ut dixi,
    febricitantis mundialis dignitas volvi ac revolvi?
-->
  Doesn't it usually seem to you, as I said, that the character of the
  feverishness of the world turns and turns again?
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Febricitantes enim spem quietis in alternatione situs ponunt
    ideoque crebris revolutionibus quando torquentur se iactant huc et illuc.
-->
  For the feverish put their hope for rest in change and so when they
  turn in frequent revolutions they throw themselves this way and that. 
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Ita nimirum potestas temporalis a Babylone devoluta ad Medos,
    inde ad Persas, post ad Graecos, ad ultimum ad Romanos
    et sub Romano nomine ad Francos translata est.
-->
  Thus without doubt temporal power rolled down from Babylon to the Medes,
  from there to the Persians, after that to the Greeks, and ultimately to the
  Romans and under the name of Rome was transferred to the French.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Ubi dum, tamquam firmam sedem fixisset, mansura videretur,
    tot malis (ut in superioribus patet) subiacere coepit
    ut merito cum Iob dicere possit:
    "Cum ad diem venero, nocturnis cruciatibus fatigatus, noctem praestolor,
    quam dum tenuero, maioribus doloribus affectus, rursum diem venire exopto."
-->
  Until it was as if it had fixed a firm seat, and seemed well settled,
  but began to sink under so many evils (as is plain to our elders)
  that one might deservedly say, with Job:
  "As I come to the day, worn out by nocturnal tortures, I await the night,
  but while I hold it, affected by a greater sorrow, I again long for the
  day to come."
</p>

<!--
    Denique armis experientissimi Franci,
    cum regni terminos plurimum dilatassent
    mundique caput Romam in suam dicionem transfudissent,
    cum iam omnibus gentibus horribiles facti essent
    et inexpugnabiles viderentur,
    in se ipsos non solum civiliter
    sed et intestine fratribus auctoribus divisi, regnum,
    quod ab oriente ad occidentem tamquam fugiens statum
    et requiem invenisse putabatur,
    desolandum fore iuxta evangelium praesagiebant.
-->
  In the end, when the Franks, most enterprising in arms,
  after greatly enlarging the borders of their kingdom
  and transferring the head of the world, Rome, into their own control,
  had already done horrible deeds to all nations and seemed invincible,
  and were divided against themselves,
  not only between citizens but even between brothers,
  the kingdom, which was thought to have found standing and rest,
  as if fleeing from east to west,
  was about to be made desolate, just as the gospels presaged.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Ex his ergo liquet nullam caducis rebus fidem habendam
    nec in se labentem alium quemlibet sibi inniti volentem sustentare posse.
-->
  And so from this it is clear that you can't trust in transitory things
  and that anyone wanting to sustain himself can't depend on one who falters.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Unde apte propheta ait:
    "Maledictus qui spem suam ponit in homine et qui ponit carnem bracchium suum.
-->
  From which the prophet said:
  "Cursed is he who puts his hope in man and who makes flesh his arm.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Quomodo enim te sustentabit qui stare non potest?
-->
  For how will he sustain you who can not stand himself?
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Vel qualiter te confirmabit qui in se infirmus est?"
-->
  Or how will he strengthen you who is himself frail?"
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Cum ergo mundus transeat et concupiscentia eius,
    ab ipsa migrandum ad Deum vivum qui est immobilis et incommutabilis manet,
    ad eiusque beatam et aeternam civitatem quis dubitaverit?
-->
  And so when the world passes, and with it its desire for worldly things,
  who would doubt that it will be translated from that desire to the living God,
  who is immovable and remains immutable, and to his blessed and eternal city?
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Igitur omnibus regnis mundi imminutis, cum et Francorum,
    qui ultimi Romam habere meruerunt, minoratum apparet regnum,
    nos qui ad ostendendas mutationes rerum res gestas scribimus
    hac regni mutatione tamquam sufficienti argumento
    ad regni caelestis immutabilitatem missi huic quinto operi finem imponamus.
-->
  Therefore, with all the kingdoms of the world diminished,
  and even the kingdom of the Franks,
  the latest to deserve to hold Rome, appearing diminished,
  let us who write histories to describe what has changed,
  with sufficient proof from this change of the kingdom,
  thrown back to the immutability of the heavenly kingdom,
  impose an end to this fifth volume.
