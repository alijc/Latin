<h4>The Capture of Jerusalem</h4>

<p>
<!--
    Ponte igitur sic ordinato,
    primus omnium vir inclitus et inlustris dux Godefridus,
    reliquos ut subsequantur exhortans,
    cum fratre suo Eustachio urbem ingressus est;
    quem continuo subsecuti sunt Ludolfus et Gislebertus,
    uterini fratres, viri nobiles et perpete digni memoria,
    ortum habentes de civitate Tornaco;
    consequenter vero infinita tam equitum quam peditum manus,
    ita ut nec machina nec pons praedictus plures posset sustinere.
-->
  And so, when the bridge had been thus placed, the first of all the men,
  the celebrated and illustrious duke Godfrey,
  entered the city with his brother Eustachus, encouraging the rest to follow.
  They were immediately followed by Ludolf and Gislebert,
  brothers of the same mother, noble men and worthy of lasting memory,
  having descent from the city of Tournai;
  following them was such a truly boundless band of horse and of foot,
  so that neither the tower nor the aforesaid bridge could support any more.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Videntes ergo hostes quod nostri murum iam occupaverant
    et dux suum iam introduxerat vexillum, turres deserunt et moenia,
    ad vicorum angustias se conferentes.
-->
  Therefore the enemy, when they saw that our men had gained the wall
  and that the duke had already carried in his banner,
  abandoned the towers and fortifications
  and took themselves to the narrow alleyways.
</p>

<p>
<!--
  Porro nostri videntes quod dux et maxima pars nobilium turres sibi
  vindicaverant, iam non exspectato per machinam ascensu,
  scalas certatim ad murum applicant, quarum illis maxima erat copia.
-->
  Later, when our men saw that the duke and the greater part of the nobles had
  taken possession of the towers, they, no longer waiting to scale by means of
  the seige engine, earnestly placed ladders, of which they had a hluge supply,
  against the wall.
</p>

<p>
<!--
  Ingressi sane statim post ducem sunt Flandrensium comes et dux Normannorum,
  vir strenuus et per omnia commendabilis, dominus Tancredus, Hugo senior,
  comes de Sancto Paulo, Balduinus de Burgo, Gasto de Beart, Gastus de Bedert,
  Girardus de Rosseillon, Thomas de Feria, Conanus Brito,
  comes Raimboldus de civitate Oringis, Ludovicus de Monson,
  Conon de Monte Acuto et Lambertus, filius eius, et alii plures,
  quorum numerum et nomina non tenemus.
-->
  Indeed, right after the duke advanced the count of the Flemish
  and the duke of Normandy, a man vigorous and commendable in all respects,
  the Lord Tancred, the elder Hugo, the count of Saint Paul, Baldwin of Burgh,
  Gaston of Beart, Gastus of Bedert, Girard of Roussillon, Thomas of Feria,
  Conan Brito, Count Raimbaut of the city of Orange, Ludovic of Monson,
  Conon of Mount Acutum and his son Lambert, and many others,
  whose number and names we don't know.
</p>

<p>
<!--
  Quos omnes postquam dux cognovit se infra urbem recepisse incolumes,
  quosdam ex eis ad portam septentrionalem,
  quae hodie dicitur Sancti Stephani, cum honesto dirigit comitatu,
  ut portam aperiant et populum introducant deforis exspectantem;
  qua sub omni celeritati reserata,
  ingressus est passim et sine delectu universus exercitus.
-->
  And after the duke found that he had gotten them all safely into the city,
  he directed some of them to the northern gate,
  which is today called after Saint Stephen, with a respectable troop,
  to open the gate and bring in the people waiting outside.
  It was unbarred with all due speed,
  and the whole army entered indiscriminately.
</p>

<p>
<!--
  Erat autem feria sexta et hora nona; videturque procuratum divinitus,
  ut qua die et qua hora pro mundi salute in eadem urbe passus est Dominus,
  eadem et pro Salvatoris gloria fidelis decertans populus
  desiderii sui felicem impetraret consummationem.
-->
  Now it was the sixth day and the ninth hour; and it seemed divinely arranged
  that he obtain the blessed purpose of his desire on that day and that hour in
  the very city in which the Lord suffered for the salvation of the world,
  and at the same time as a faithful people fighting for the Savior's glory.
</p>

<p>
<!--
  Porro dux et qui cum eo erant per vicos civitatis et plateas,
  strictis gladiis, clipeis tecti et galeis, iuncto agmine discurrentes,
  quotquot de hostibus reperire poterant, aetati non parcentes aut condicioni,
  in ore gladii indifferenter prosternebant.
-->
  The duke and those who were with him dashed onward through the streets and
  avenues of the city in a thronging stream, with swords drawn and protected by
  shields and helmets, and struck down with the edge of their swords however
  many of the enemy they could find, without distinction,
  sparing neither age nor condition.
</p>

<p>
<!--
  Tantaque erat ubique interemptorum strages et praecisorum acervus capitum
  ut iam nemini via pateret aut transitus, nisi per funera defunctorum.
-->
  And everywhere was such a slaughter of the dead and a pile of severed heads
  that now a way or passage stood open to no-one,
  except over the bodies of the dead.
</p>

<p>
<!--
  Iamque paene ad urbis medium diversis itineribus, stragem operantes innumeram,
  nostri principes pervenerant et subsequentis populi infinita multitudo,
  infidelium cruorem sitiens et ad caedem omnino proclivis,
  cum comes adhuc Tolosanus et principes alii qui cum eo erant,
  circa montem Sion decertantes, urbem captam et nostrorum victoriam ignorabant.
-->
  And now our princes reached nearly to the center of the
  city, making an immense slaughter along their separate paths,
  with a boundless mob of people behind them,
  thirsting for infidel blood and bent utterly to murder,
  while the count of Toulouse and the other princes who were with him,
  fighting around Mount Zion,
  still didn't know about the capture of the city and our victory.
