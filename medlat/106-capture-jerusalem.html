    Ponte igitur sic ordinato,
    primus omnium vir inclitus et inlustris dux Godefridus,
    reliquos ut subsequantur exhortans,
    cum fratre suo Eustachio urbem ingressus est;
    quem continuo subsecuti sunt Ludolfus et Gislebertus,
    uterini fratres, viri nobiles et perpete digni memoria,
    ortum habentes de civitate Tornaco;
    consequenter vero infinita tam equitum quam peditum manus,
    ita ut nec machina nec pons praedictus plures posset sustinere.
-->
  And so, when the bridge had been thus placed, the first of all the men,
  the celebrated and illustrious duke Godfrey, encouraging the rest to follow,
  entered the city with his brother Eustachus;
  and were immediately followed by Ludolf and Gislebert, brothers of the same
  mother, noble men and worthy of lasting memory,
  having descent from the city of Tournai;
  following them was such a truly boundless band of horse and of foot,
  so that neither the tower nor the aforesaid bridge could support any more.

<!--
    Videntes ergo hostes quod nostri murum iam occupaverant
    et dux suum iam introduxerat vexillum, turres deserunt et moenia,
    ad vicorum angustias se conferentes.
-->
  And so, when the enemy saw that our men had gained the wall
  and that the duke had already carried in his banner,
  they abandoned the towers and fortifications
  and took themselves to the narrow alleyways.

<!--
  Porro nostri videntes quod dux et maxima pars nobilium turres sibi
  vindicaverant, iam non exspectato per machinam ascensu,
  scalas certatim ad murum applicant, quarum illis maxima erat copia.
-->
  Later, when our men saw that the duke and the greater part of the nobles had
  taken possession of the towers, they, no longer waiting to scale by means of
  the seige engine, earnestly placed ladders, of which they had a hluge supply,
  against the wall.

  Indeed, right after the duke advanced the count of the Flemish
