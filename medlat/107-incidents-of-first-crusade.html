    Explicita itaque, Deo auctore, victoria, Babylonicae princeps militiae,
    quem patria lingua admiravisum vocitant, confusus,
    et infortunium quod sibi acciderat satis admirari non praevalens,
    multa conqueritur.
-->
  And so, with the victory, by God the Creator, won, the commander of the
  Babylonian army, whom in their native tongue they call the admiravisus,
  was troubled, and as the misfortune that had happened to him was not 
  powerful enough to wonder at, lamented greatly.

    Considerabat nimirum infinitas quas adduxerat copias,
    lectissimam iuventutem fortitudine ac specie, arma nobilia,
    commilitonum opes et, ut sic dixerim, cuncta equestria et,
    quod animis maximam quorumque inertium parere securitatem solet,
    pro foribus urbis suae, ad quam certa refugia,
    in propria pugnavisse provincia.
-->
  He thought hard on the limitless troops that he had led, the youth,
  selected for their strength and appearance, his outstanding arms,
  his soldiers' courage and, as I have thus said, all his horse and,
  since he was wont to bear the greatest security for the souls of the weak,
  and that he had fought in his own province, before the gates of the his city,
  which was a sure refuge.

    At Francos intuebatur modis omnibus inferiore militia,
    profligatam diutina fame iuventam, rubiginosis ensibus,
    lanceis nigrantibus, exilem destitutis militum viribus armaturam,
    cunctis qui prae ceteris videbantur insignes acri egestate torpentibus,
    equis omnimodo squalore fatiscentibus;
    et, ut brevi clausula solvam, pauperrimos omnium, exulem globum,
    innumerabiles superasse indigenas mirabatur;
    quin potius, per abiectissimos hominum totius Orientis gloriam concidisse.
-->
  But he considered the French in every way with an inferior army,
  with their youth overcome long lasting hunger, with rusty swords
  and black lances, poor armor with soldiers devoid of strength,
  with any who seemed more distinguished than the rest numbed by bitter poverty,
  with horses exhausted with hardship of every kind;
  and, so that I might remove a brief end, the poorest men of all, an exile, a globe,
  he was amazed that they'd overcome the countless native-born;
  more, in fact, that through the most downcast of men
  they had destroyed the glory of the entire East.

<!--
    Iuvit quoque nostrorum victoriam plurimum quod,
    conclamata in hostili exercitu fuga,
    admiravisus ille qui praeerat Ascaloni,
    ubi conspexit Babylonicum vertere terga ducem,
    fugitivos omnes a propriae urbis ingressu mandat arceri.
-->
  It also aided our men's victory the more that, 
  when the flight was signaled within the enemy army,
  when the admiravisus who controlled Ascalon
  saw the Babylonian commander turn tail,
  he ordered that all the fugitives be kept away from his own city.

<!--
    Mirabantur plane etiam idem plus nimio hostes,
    quod minime Franci pro moenibus Iherosolimae,
    quasi contigui causa praesidii, pugnare delegerant,
    sed sibi obviam duorum itinere dierum paene processerant.
-->
  The enemy were clearly amazed still the same exceedingly
  that the French had not at all chosen to fight before the walls of Jerusalem,
  as if on account of the neighboring garrison, 
  but had advanced against themselves in a march of nearly two days.
