<h4>Incidents of the First Crusade</h4>

<p>
<!--
    (1099)
    Explicita itaque, Deo auctore, victoria, Babylonicae princeps militiae,
    quem patria lingua admiravisum vocitant, confusus,
    et infortunium quod sibi acciderat satis admirari non praevalens,
    multa conqueritur.
-->
  (1099)
  And so, with the victory, by God the Creator, won, the commander of the
  Babylonian army, whom in their native tongue they call an emir,
  was perplexed and lamented greatly,
  unable to comprehend the misfortune that had happened to him.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Considerabat nimirum infinitas quas adduxerat copias,
    lectissimam iuventutem fortitudine ac specie, arma nobilia,
    commilitonum opes et, ut sic dixerim, cuncta equestria et,
    quod animis maximam quorumque inertium parere securitatem solet,
    pro foribus urbis suae, ad quam certa refugia,
    in propria pugnavisse provincia.
-->
  He thought hard on the limitless troops that he had brought, the youth,
  selected for their strength and appearance, his outstanding arms,
  his soldiers' courage and, as I may say, all his horse and,
  what tends to bear the greatest security for the minds of weak men,
  that they fought in their own province, before the gates of their city,
  in which they had sure refuges.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    At Francos intuebatur modis omnibus inferiore militia,
    profligatam diutina fame iuventam, rubiginosis ensibus,
    lanceis nigrantibus, exilem destitutis militum viribus armaturam,
    cunctis qui prae ceteris videbantur insignes acri egestate torpentibus,
    equis omnimodo squalore fatiscentibus;
    et, ut brevi clausula solvam, pauperrimos omnium, exulem globum,
    innumerabiles superasse indigenas mirabatur;
    quin potius, per abiectissimos hominum totius Orientis gloriam concidisse.
-->
  But he considered the French, with an army inferior in every way,
  with their youth overcome long lasting hunger, with rusty swords
  and blackened lances, poor armor with soldiers devoid of strength,
  with any who seemed more distinguished than the rest numbed by bitter poverty,
  with their mounts exhausted with hardship of every kind;
  and, in short, he was amazed that the most worthless men of all,
  an exile band, had overcome his countless native sons;
  more, in fact, that through the lowliest of men
  they had destroyed the glory of the entire East.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Iuvit quoque nostrorum victoriam plurimum quod,
    conclamata in hostili exercitu fuga,
    admiravisus ille qui praeerat Ascaloni,
    ubi conspexit Babylonicum vertere terga ducem,
    fugitivos omnes a propriae urbis ingressu mandat arceri.
-->
  It also aided our victory that, 
  when the retreat was signaled in the enemy army
  and the emir in charge of Ascalon saw the Babylonian commander turn tail,
  he ordered that all those fleeing be kept out of his own city.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Mirabantur plane etiam idem plus nimio hostes,
    quod minime Franci pro moenibus Iherosolimae,
    quasi contigui causa praesidii, pugnare delegerant,
    sed sibi obviam duorum itinere dierum paene processerant.
-->
  The enemy were clearly exceedingly amazed 
  that the French had not chosen to fight before the walls of Jerusalem,
  as if on account of the neighboring garrison, 
  but had advanced against themselves in a march of nearly two days.
</p>

<p>START</p>

</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
(1104) Miles quidam protervius quam debuerat contra regem sese habuerat, quem rex ipse Tiberiadi civitati praefecerat.
-->
  (1104) A certain soldier,
  whom king Baldwin himself had placed in command of the city of Tiberias,
  was more impudent than he ought to have been,
  and had behaved badly towards the king.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Rex ergo, citatus ob insolentiam hominis ira, iussit eum a suae dicionis terra recedere.
-->
  And so the king, filled with wrath because of the man's insolence,
  ordered him to withdraw from the land that he controlled.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Qui cum duobus equitibus dum abire properaret, armigeris totidem comitatus, maximas subito copias gentilitatis offendit.
-->
  And as he hurried to leave, with two knights and as many squires as an escort,
  he suddenly encountered a great many troops of pagans.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Qui, suo numero diffidens, ad Deum vero utcumque respectans, concisa camisia, quam subuculam dicunt, hastae pro vexillo apposuit, itidem socios facere iussit.
-->
  And he, lacking confidence in his own numbers,
  truly respecting God in every way,
  cut up his shirt, which they call the under-tunic,
  and raised it for a banner on a spear, ordering his companions to do likewise.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Fecerunt et, clamore sublato, sonipedes calcaribus urgent obviosque feruntur in hostes.
-->
  They did so and, raising a war-cry, spurred on their steeds and bore
  themselves against the enemy.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Qui, territi repentinis ausibus, dum aestimant quod quasi praevios sequerentur multae cohortes, fugam ineunt, seque tribus illis caedendos exponunt.
-->
  Now they were terrified by this unexpected daring-do,
  as they assumed that these men were leading many following cohortes,
  and took to flight, exposing themselves to be slaughtered by these three men.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Plurimi perimuntur; plus quam ferre sufficiant spolia rapiuntur.
-->
  Most of the enemy were killed;
  and they seized more plunder than they could carry.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quo eventu ille secundo compungitur, Deoque gratulabundus rediens, regi prosternitur; ei se oboediturum deinceps fideliter pollicetur.
-->
  After this event he was again filled with remorse and,
  rendering thanks to God, prostrated himself before the king,
  promising that he would faithfully obey him thereafter.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
(1104) Aliquando idem rex pecuniae grandi angustabatur inopia, ut etiam deessent menstrua quae militibus debebantur stipendia; cum ecce, se ei munificam mirabiliter praebuit divina clementia.
-->
  (1104) Once the same king was choked by a great want of money,
  so that he was even short the monthly wages that were owed to the soldiers;
  when behold, divine mercy itself marvelously provided him with a bounty.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
In tantum namque iam vexabatur ut eum satellites ac milites deserere meditarentur, cum ecce Ioppitae iuvenes cum lavandi, immo ludendi gratia haud procul a maris litore mergerentur, reperiunt quadam die in ipso harenarum salique confligio, manticas magnis auri ponderibus plenas, quas amiserant Venetii, quos ibi constiterat fregisse carinas.
-->
  For he was by then so greatly troubled that his attendants and soldiers
  were on the verge of deserting him, when behold, the young men of Joppa
  one day were swimming into the sea not far from the shore, bathing,
  no indeed horseplaying, and discovered,
  in the very dashing together of sand and sea,
  sacks filled with a great weight of gold, which the Venetians had lost
  in a shipwreck there.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Quae regi delatae, cunctis miraculum ineffabile, regi paene desperato et novae christianitati praebuere solacium.
-->
  And these were carried to the king, an indescribable wonder to everyone,
  and provided comfort to the nearly desperate king and to young Christianity.
