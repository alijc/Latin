    Explicita itaque, Deo auctore, victoria, Babylonicae princeps militiae,
    quem patria lingua admiravisum vocitant, confusus,
    et infortunium quod sibi acciderat satis admirari non praevalens,
    multa conqueritur.
-->
  And so, with the victory, by God the Creator, won, the commander of the
  Babylonian army, whom in their native tongue they call an emir,
  was perplexed and lamented greatly,
  unable to admire the misfortune that had happened to him.

<p>AJC
<!--
    Considerabat nimirum infinitas quas adduxerat copias,
    lectissimam iuventutem fortitudine ac specie, arma nobilia,
    commilitonum opes et, ut sic dixerim, cuncta equestria et,
    quod animis maximam quorumque inertium parere securitatem solet,
    pro foribus urbis suae, ad quam certa refugia,
    in propria pugnavisse provincia.
-->
  He thought hard on the limitless supplies that he had brought, the youth,
  selected for their strength and appearance, his outstanding arms,
  his soldiers' courage and, as I should have said, all his horse and,
  what was wont to bear the greatest security for the courage of weak men,
  and that they fought in their own province, before the gates of their city,
  which was a sure refuge.

<!--
    At Francos intuebatur modis omnibus inferiore militia,
    profligatam diutina fame iuventam, rubiginosis ensibus,
    lanceis nigrantibus, exilem destitutis militum viribus armaturam,
    cunctis qui prae ceteris videbantur insignes acri egestate torpentibus,
    equis omnimodo squalore fatiscentibus;
    et, ut brevi clausula solvam, pauperrimos omnium, exulem globum,
    innumerabiles superasse indigenas mirabatur;
    quin potius, per abiectissimos hominum totius Orientis gloriam concidisse.
-->
  But he considered the French, with an army inferior in every way,
  with their youth overcome long lasting hunger, with rusty swords
  and black lances, poor armor with soldiers devoid of strength,
  with any who seemed more distinguished than the rest numbed by bitter poverty,
  with their mounts exhausted with hardship of every kind;
  and, to come to brief end, he was amazed that the most worthless men of all,
  an exile band, had overcome his countless native sons;
  more, in fact, that through the most downcast of men
  they had destroyed the glory of the entire East.

<p>AJC
<!--
    Iuvit quoque nostrorum victoriam plurimum quod,
    conclamata in hostili exercitu fuga,
    admiravisus ille qui praeerat Ascaloni,
    ubi conspexit Babylonicum vertere terga ducem,
    fugitivos omnes a propriae urbis ingressu mandat arceri.
-->
  It also aided our victory that, 
  when the retreat was signaled in the enemy army
  and the emir in charge of Ascalon saw the Babylonian commander turn tail,
  he ordered that all those fleeing be kept out of his own city.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Mirabantur plane etiam idem plus nimio hostes,
    quod minime Franci pro moenibus Iherosolimae,
    quasi contigui causa praesidii, pugnare delegerant,
    sed sibi obviam duorum itinere dierum paene processerant.
-->
  The enemy were clearly exceedingly amazed 
  that the French had not chosen to fight before the walls of Jerusalem,
  as if on account of the neighboring garrison, 
  but had advanced against themselves in a march of nearly two days.
