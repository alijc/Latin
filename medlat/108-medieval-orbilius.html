<h4>A Medieval Orbilius</h4>

<p>START</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Semel in schola vapulaveram;
    schola autem non alia erat quam quoddam domus nostrae triclinium.
-->
  I was beaten once in school;
  but the school was nothing more than the dining room of our house.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Aliorum enim quos aliquando docens acceperat mei solius causa curas omiserat.
-->
  For the teacher put aside his concerns for the other students
  that he had accepted, for my sake alone.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Sic enim aucto quaestu et delatione honoris prudens ab eo mater exegerat.
-->
  For by thus increasing his profit and conferring the honor of her patronage
  my prudent mother had exacted this from him.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Soluto igitur vespertinis quibusdam horis qualicumque illo studio, ad materna genua graviter etiam praeter meritum caesus accesseram.
-->
  And so, when released from those studies in the evening,
  I approached the maternal knee reluctantly, beaten yet again beyond my due.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Quae cum an eo vapulassem die, ut erat solita, rogitare coepisset et ego,
    ne magistrum detulisse viderer, factum omnino negarem, ipsa, vellem nollem,
    reiecta interula, quam subuculam, immo camisiam vocant, liventes attendit
    ulnulas dorsiculi ex viminum illisione et cutem ubique prominulam.
-->
  And when she'd begin to ask, as was her wont, if I'd been beaten that day,
  and I, lest I seem to accuse the teacher, would utterly deny it,
  she'd, willy-nilly, throw back my undergarment, what they call a tunic,
  no indeed, a shirt, and take heed of the livid little ribs of my small back
  from blows of a switch and my skin, covered all over with welts.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Cumque poenam meae teneritudini ad nimium saeve illatam visceraliter doluisset,
turbulenta et aestuans et oculos maerore suffusa: "Numquam," ait, 
"deinceps clericus fies nec, ut litteras discas, ulterius poenas lues.”
-->
  And after she'd grieved, from the bottom of her heart,
  for the punishment inflicted too savagely for my tender years,
  disturbed and with burning eyes and welling with grief, she said:
  "After this you'll never become a scholar,
  nor will you pay such great a price to learn your letters." 
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Ad haec ego eam cum qua poteram animadversione respiciens: "Si," inquam, 
“proinde mori contingeret, non desistam quin litteras discam et clericus fiam.”
-->
  At this I looked at her as reproachfully as I could and said:
  "Even if I were to die, I'll not stop learning my letters
  and will become a scholar."
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
Promiserat enim si eques vellem fieri, cum ad id temporis emersissem, apparatum se mihi militiae et arma daturam.
-->
  For she had promised that if I wanted to become a knight,
  she'd give me the equipment and arms, after I'd risen to the age for it.
</p>
