<h4>The Wreck of the White Ship</h4>

<p>
<!--
    Thomas, filius Stephani, regem adiit eique marcum auri offerens ait:
    "Stephanus, Airardi filius,
    genitor meus fuit et ipse in omni vita sua patri tuo in mari servivit.
-->
  Thomas FitzStephen approached the king and said to him,
  offering him a gold mark: "Stephen FitzAirardus was my father,
  and he served your father on the sea his whole life.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Nam illum in sua puppe vectum in Angliam conduxit quando contra Haraldum pugnaturus in Angliam perrexit.
-->
  For he conducted him to England, borne on his own ship,
  when he went to England to wage war against Harold.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Huiusmodi autem officio usque ad mortem famulando ei placuit et ab eo multis honoratus exeniis inter contribules suos magnifice floruit.
-->
  Now he pleased the king in his attendence in this manner until his death,
  and, honored by him with many rewards, he prospered splendidly
  among his own countrymen.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Hoc feudum, domine rex, a te requiro et vas quod Candida Navis appellatur
merito ad regalem famulatum optime instructum habeo.”
-->
  This same privilege, lord king, I ask of you and have fitted out the vessel
  that is rightly called the White Ship exceeding well for royal service."
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Cui rex ait: "Gratum habeo quod petis.
-->
  And the king said to him: "What you ask pleases me.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Mihi quidem aptam navim elegi, quam non mutabo;
    sed filios meos, Guillelmum et Richardum, quos sicut me diligo,
    cum multa regni mei nobilitate, nunc tibi commendo.”
-->
  Indeed, I have chosen an apt ship for myself, which I'll not exchange;
  but I now entrust to you my sons, Willian and Richard, whom I love as myself,
  with the great nobility of my kingdom."
</p>

<p>
<!--
His auditis nautae gavisi sunt filioque regis adulantes, vinum ab eo ad bibendum postulaverunt.
-->
  When the sailors heard this they rejoiced and, flattering the king's son,
  asked him for wine for drinking toasts.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Iussu regis multi barones cum filiis suis puppim ascenderunt et fere trecenti, ut opinor, in infausta nave fuerunt.
-->
  By the king's order many barons boarded the ship with his sons
  and nearly three hundred, as I suppose, were on the ill-fated ship.
</p>

<p>START</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Duo siquidem monachi Tironis et Stephanus comes cum duobus militibus
    et alii plures inde exierunt quia nimiam multitudinem lascivae
    et pompaticae iuventutis inesse conspicati sunt.
-->
  Accordingly, two novice monks and Count Stephen with two knights
  and several others left, because they observed that
  such a large crowd of wanton and insolent youths were on board.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Periti enim remiges quinquaginta ibi erant et feroces epibatae,
    qui iam in navi sedes nacti turgebant et suimet prae ebrietate
    immemores vix aliquem reverenter agnoscebant.
-->
  For there were fifty skilled oarsmen and armed marines there,
  who had already taken seats on the ship and, swollen with insolence
  and dead drunk, scarcely acknowledged anyone with respect.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Heu, quam plures illorum mentes pia devotione erga Deum habebant vacuas
    "qui maris immodicas moderatur et aeris iras.”
-->
  Alas, how many of them had minds empty of pious devotion towards God
  "who governs the vastness of the sea and the fury of the air."
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Unde sacerdotes, qui ad benedicendos illos illuc accesserant,
    aliosque ministros, qui aquam benedictam deferebant,
    cum dedecore et cachinnis subsannantes abegerunt;
    sed paulo  post derisionis suae ultionem receperunt.
-->
  And due to this they drove away the priests who had come there to bless them,
  and the other attendants who were carrying the holy water,
  mocking them with shame and guffaws;
  but a little later they received retribution for their derision. 
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Soli homines, cum thesauro regis et vasis merum ferentibus,
    Thomae carinam implebant ipsumque ut regiam classem,
    quae iam aequora sulcabat, summopere prosequeretur commonebant.
-->
  It was only men, along with the king's treasure and vessels full of wine,
  that filled Thomas's ship, and they pressed him hard to chase the royal fleet,
  which was already plowing the seas.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Ipse vero, quia ebrietate desipiebat,
    in virtute sua satellitumque suorum confidebat
    et audacter quia omnes qui iam praecesserant praeiret spondebat.
-->
  Indeed, Thomas, out of his head with drink,
  was confident in his strength and that of his companions,
  and rashly promised to get ahead of all those who had already sailed.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Tandem navigandi signum dedit.
-->
  Finally, he gave the signal to sail.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Porro schippae remos haud segniter arripuerunt et alia laeti,
    quia quid eis ante oculos penderet nesciebant,
    armamenta coaptaverunt navemque cum impetu magno per pontum currere fecerunt.
-->
  In turn the sailors, not at all half-heartedly, seized the oars and joyfully,
  since they knew not what lay before them, adjusted the other rigging and
  with great vigor made the ship speed across the sea.
</p>

<p>END</p>
