<h4>The Wreck of the White Ship</h4>

<p>
<!--
    Thomas, filius Stephani, regem adiit eique marcum auri offerens ait:
    "Stephanus, Airardi filius,
    genitor meus fuit et ipse in omni vita sua patri tuo in mari servivit.
-->
  Thomas FitzStephen approached the king and said to him,
  offering him a gold mark: "Stephen FitzAirardus was my father,
  and he served your father on the sea his whole life.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Nam illum in sua puppe vectum in Angliam conduxit quando contra Haraldum pugnaturus in Angliam perrexit.
-->
  For he conducted him to England, borne on his own ship,
  when he went to England to wage war against Harold.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Huiusmodi autem officio usque ad mortem famulando ei placuit et ab eo multis honoratus exeniis inter contribules suos magnifice floruit.
-->
  Now he pleased the king in his attendence in this manner until his death,
  and, honored by him with many rewards, he prospered splendidly
  among his own countrymen.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Hoc feudum, domine rex, a te requiro et vas quod Candida Navis appellatur
merito ad regalem famulatum optime instructum habeo.”
-->
  This same privilege, lord king, I ask of you and have fitted out the vessel
  that is rightly called the White Ship exceeding well for royal service."
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Cui rex ait: "Gratum habeo quod petis.
-->
  And the king said to him: "What you ask pleases me.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Mihi quidem aptam navim elegi, quam non mutabo;
    sed filios meos, Guillelmum et Richardum, quos sicut me diligo,
    cum multa regni mei nobilitate, nunc tibi commendo.”
-->
  Indeed, I have chosen an apt ship for myself, which I'll not exchange;
  but I now entrust to you my sons, Willian and Richard, whom I love as myself,
  with the great nobility of my kingdom."
</p>

<p>
<!--
His auditis nautae gavisi sunt filioque regis adulantes, vinum ab eo ad bibendum postulaverunt.
-->
  When the sailors heard this they rejoiced and, flattering the king's son,
  asked him for wine for drinking toasts.
</p>

<p>
<!--
Iussu regis multi barones cum filiis suis puppim ascenderunt et fere trecenti, ut opinor, in infausta nave fuerunt.
-->
  By the king's order many barons boarded the ship with his sons
  and nearly three hundred, as I suppose, were on the ill-fated ship.
