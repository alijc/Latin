<h4>Abelard in Retirement</h4>

<p>
<!--
    Ego itaque ad solitudinem quandam in Trecensi pago, mihi antea cognitam,
    me contuli, ibique a quibusdam terra mihi donata,
    assensu episcopi terrae oratorium quoddam in nomine sanctae Trinitatis
    ex calamis et culmo primum construxi.
-->
  And so I conveyed myself to a certain lonely place in the district of Troyes,
  that was already familiar to me, and there, with the agreement of the bishop
  of the country, I constructed, on land that some men had given me, an oratory
  in name of the Holy Trinity, out of reeds and straw at first.

    Ubi cum quodam clerico nostro latitans, illud vere Domino poteram decantare:
    "Ecce elongavi fugiens et mansi in solitudine.”
-->
  And hiding there with a cleric of mine, I could rightly recite this to the
  Lord: "Behold, I left in flight and remained in the wilderness."
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Quod cum cognovissent scholares, coeperunt undique concurrere et,
    relictis civitatibus et castellis, solitudinem inhabitare,
    et pro amplis domibus parva tabernacula sibi construere,
    et pro delicatis cibis herbis agrestibus et pane cibario victitare,
    et pro mollibus stratis culmum sibi et stramen comparare,
    et pro mensis glebas erigere.
-->
  And when scholars learned about this, they began to throng together
  from every direction, leaving cities and castles to dwell in solitude -
  to build small huts for themselves instead of great houses,
  to subsist on rustic vegetables and coarse bread instead of dainty fare,
  to lie down on straw bedding instead of soft beds,
  and to build tables of turf.

<!--
    Et vere eos priores philosophos imitari crederes, de quibus et Hieronymus
    in libro secundo contra Iovinianum his commemorat verbis:
    "Per sensus quasi per quasdam fenestras vitiorum ad animam introitus est.
-->
  And indeed you'd've thought that they imitated earlier philosophers,
  about whom Jerome too, in his second book against Jovian, wrote these words:
  "The entrance of vice to the soul is via the senses, as if through windows.

<!--
    Non potest metropolis et arx mentis capi,
    nisi per portas inruerit hostilis exercitus.”
-->
  The city and the citadel of the mind cannot be taken,
  unless a hostile army charges through its gates."
