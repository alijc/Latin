<h4>Abelard in Retirement</h4>

<p>
<!--
    Ego itaque ad solitudinem quandam in Trecensi pago, mihi antea cognitam,
    me contuli, ibique a quibusdam terra mihi donata,
    assensu episcopi terrae oratorium quoddam in nomine sanctae Trinitatis
    ex calamis et culmo primum construxi.
-->
  And so I conveyed myself to a certain lonely place in the district of Troyes,
  that was already familiar to me, and there, with the agreement of the bishop
  of the country, I constructed, on land that some men had given me, an oratory
  in name of the Holy Trinity, out of reeds and straw at first.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Ubi cum quodam clerico nostro latitans, illud vere Domino poteram decantare:
    "Ecce elongavi fugiens et mansi in solitudine.”
-->
  And hiding there with a cleric of mine, I could rightly recite this to the
  Lord: "Behold, I left in flight and remained in the wilderness."
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Quod cum cognovissent scholares, coeperunt undique concurrere et,
    relictis civitatibus et castellis, solitudinem inhabitare,
    et pro amplis domibus parva tabernacula sibi construere,
    et pro delicatis cibis herbis agrestibus et pane cibario victitare,
    et pro mollibus stratis culmum sibi et stramen comparare,
    et pro mensis glebas erigere.
-->
  And when scholars learned about this, they began to throng together
  from every direction, leaving cities and castles to dwell in solitude -
  to build small huts for themselves instead of great houses,
  to subsist on rustic vegetables and coarse bread instead of dainty fare,
  to lie down on straw bedding instead of soft beds,
  and to build tables of turf.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Et vere eos priores philosophos imitari crederes, de quibus et Hieronymus
    in libro secundo contra Iovinianum his commemorat verbis:
    "Per sensus quasi per quasdam fenestras vitiorum ad animam introitus est.
-->
  And indeed you'd've thought that they imitated earlier philosophers,
  about whom Jerome too, in his second book against Jovian, wrote these words:
  "The entrance of vice to the soul is via the senses, as if through windows.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Non potest metropolis et arx mentis capi,
    nisi per portas inruerit hostilis exercitus.”
-->
  The city and the citadel of the mind cannot be taken,
  unless a hostile army charges through its gates."
</p>

<p>
<!--
    His igitur rationibus invitati multi philosophorum reliquerunt
    frequentias urbium et hortulos suburbanos,
    ubi ager irriguus et arborum comae et susurrus avium, fontis speculum,
    rivus murmurans, et multae oculorum auriumque illecebrae,
    ne per luxum et abundantiam copiarum animae fortitudo mollesceret,
    et eius pudicitia stupraretur.
-->
  And so for these reasons many of the philosophers were impelled to leave
  the crowds of the cities and their surrounding gardens,
  where there was a well watered field and foliage of trees and the whispering
  of birds, the mirror of a spring, a murmuring stream and
  many allurements for the eye and ear,
  lest through luxury and an abundance of spirit their strength become soft,
  and their chastity defiled.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Inutile quippe est crebro videre per quae aliquando captus sis,
    et eorum te experimento committere quibus difficulter careas.
-->
  By all means, it's not often useful to see the things that used to catch you,
  and to put yourself to the trial of what was difficult to give up.
</p>

<p>
    Nam et Pythagoraei huiusmodi frequentiam declinantes,
    in solitudine et desertis locis habitare consueverant.
-->
  For even the Pythagorians, declining any sort of bustle,
  were accustomed to dwell in solitude and deserted places.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Sed et ipse Plato cum dives esset et torum eius Diogenes lutatis pedibus
    conculcaret, ut posset vacare  philosophiae,
    elegit Academiam villam ab urbe procul non solum desertam
    sed et pestilentem ut cura et assiduitate morborum libidinis
    impetus frangerentur, discipulique sui nullam aliam sentirent voluptatem
    nisi earum rerum quas discerent.
-->
  Even Plato himself, when he was wealthy and Diogenes 
  trampled his cushion with his muddy feet, chose, to free him of philosophy,
  a building far from the city for his Academy, not only deserted
  but also unhealthy so that through care and attention of illnesses
  the assault of desire might be crushed,
  and his disciples would feel no other pleasure except of what they learned.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Talem et filii prophetarum Eliseo adhaerentes vitam referuntur duxisse.
-->
  The sons of the prophets following Elisha are also said to have led such a life.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    De quibus ipse quoque Hieronymus, quasi de monachis illius temporis,
    ad Rusticum monachum inter cetera ita scribit:
    "Filii prophetarum, quos monachos in veteri legimus testamento,
    aedificabant sibi casulas prope fluenta Iordanis,
    et turbis et urbibus derelictis, polenta et herbis agrestibus victitabant.”
-->
  Jerome himself also, wrote about this, among other things, 
   as if about monks of those times, to the monk Rusticus:
  "The sons of the prophets, those monks that we read in the Old Testament,
  built huts for themselves close by the flowing Jordan,
  and after abandoning commotions and cities, lived on barley-meal and rustic
  herbs. 
</p>

<p>
<!--
   Tales discipuli nostri ibi super Arduzonem fluvium casulas suas aedificantes,
   heremitae magis quam scholares videbantur.
-->
  And so our disciples, building their own huts there on the Ardusson,
  seemed more hermits than scholars.
</p>

<p>
<!--
    Quanto autem illuc maior scholarium erat confluentia,
    et quanto duriorem in doctrina nostra vitam sustinebant,
    tanto amplius mihi aemuli aestimabant gloriosum et sibi ignominiosum.
-->
  But however many distinguished scholars gathered there,
  and however roughly they sustained life in our instruction,
  that much more did my rivals consider me glorious and themselves disgraced.
