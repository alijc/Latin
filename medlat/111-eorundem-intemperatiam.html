EORUNDEM (I. E. CLUNIACENSIUM) INTEMPERANTIAM 
COMPARAT CUM ANTIQUORUM MONACHORUM
PARCIMONIAM -->

<h4>
  He Compares Their (I.E. Cluny's) Extravagance
  with the Parsimony of Monks of Old
  </h4>

<p>START</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Quis in principio, cum ordo coepit monasticus,
    ad tantam crederet monachos inertiam devenire?
-->
  In the beginning, when the monastic order began, 
  who could believe that monks would arrive at such ignorance.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    O quantum distamus ab his qui in diebus Antonii existere monachi!
-->
  Oh how much we differ from those who became monks in the days of Anthony!
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Siquidem illi cum se invicem per tempus ex caritate reviserent,
    tanta ab invicem aviditate panem animarum percipiebant
    ut, corporis cibum penitus obliti,
    diem plerumque totum ieiunis ventribus sed non mentibus transigerent.
-->
  Accordingly, when they visited each other in charity as the opportunity arose,
  they gained the bread of life from each other with such passion that
  they thoroughly forgot about food for the body, 
  and often passed a whole day with their bellies fasting but not their minds. 
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Et hic erat rectus ordo, quando digniori parti prius inserviebatur;
    haec summa discretio, cum amplius sumebat quae maior erat;
    haec denique vera caritas, ubi animae, quarum caritate Christus mortuus est,
    tanta sollicitudine refocillabantur.
-->
  And this was a proper order, since the past was treated with deference
  by the more worthy part;
  this highest discrimination, the more it assumed the greater it was;
  finally, this true charity, where the souls that Christ died for in charity
  were revived with such solicitude.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    "Nobis autem convenientibus in unum,” ut verbis apostoli utar,
    "iam non est dominicam cenam manducare.”
-->
  "But when we assemble together," if I might use the words of the apostle,
  "it is not to eat the lord's supper."
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Panem quippe caelestem nemo est qui requirat, nemo qui tribuat.
-->
  Indeed there is no-one who'd seek heavenly bread, no-one who'd bestow it.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Nihil de scripturis, nihil de salute agitur animarum;
    sed nugae et risus et verba proferuntur in ventum.
-->
  Nothing about scriptures, nothing about salvation is done for souls;
  but trifles and laughter and words are pushed out into the wind.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Inter prandendum quantum fauces dapibus, tantum aures pascuntur rumoribus;
    quibus totus intentus modum nescias in edendo.
-->
  As much as our gullets eat at banquets, that much are our ears fed on rumors;
  in which you, closely attentive, might not know the manner in eating.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Interim autem fercula ferculis apponuntur;
    et pro solis carnibus, a quibus abstinetur,
    grandia piscium corpora duplicantur.
-->
  But meanwhile the food trays are set down;
  and for only meat, from which one is abstained,
  great bodies of fish are served in double portions.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
    Cumque prioribus fueris satiatus, si secundos attigeris,
    videberis tibi necdum gustasse priores.
-->
  And since you were sated with he first portion, if you touch what follows,
  it'll seem to you that you never tasted what came first.
</p>

<p>END</p>
