<!--XXX De Quodam Solitario-->
<h4>A Certain Hermit</h4>

<p>
<!--
Fuit quidam solitarius habens duo colobia, unum in sollemnitatibus
et aliud cotidianum. Venit quidam pauper hiemis tempore quaerens
indumentum. Ille vero eduxit panem et dedit ei dicens: "Accipe
hoc, quia indumentum non habeo superfluum quod tibi donem." Pauper
vero non cessabat flere ac vociferare dicens: "Miserere mei."
Victus itaque monachus a prece pauperis, intrans cellam suam exuit
se cotidiano colobio et dedit pauperi; sibi autem retinuit
melius. Postea vero compunctus dixit pauperi: "Redde mihi quod
tibi dedi colobium et accipe hoc melius."

 There once was a hermit who had two cloaks, one for feast days
 and the other for everyday.  One winter a poor man came and asked
 for clothing.  Indeed he held out a loaf of bread and gave it to
 him, saying.  "Take this, for I have no extra clothing to give
 you."  Indeed the poor man didn't stop weeping and crying,
 saying: "Have mercy on me."  And so the monk, overcome by the
 poor man's prayer, went into his cell and pulled off his everyday
 cloak and gave it to the poor man; but he keep the better one.
 But he was remorseful later and said to the poor man: "Give me
 back the cloak that I gave you and take this better one."

Cum autem accepisset, induit se illud et abiens in civitatem
vendidit illud cuidam meretrici. Illa vero induens se illud venit
semel et bis ubi erat ille monachus. Ut autem vidit indumentum
suum, recognovit quia suum esset quo in sollemnitatibus
utebatur. Contristatus est valde et intrans cellam suam dixit:
"Vere quia non placuit Deo hoc quod feci nec recepit meam
devotionem, quoniam in talibus manibus venit pallium meum, quo
ego in diebus festis induebar et modo meretrix utitur eo."

 When he had taken it, he put it on and, going out into the city,
 sold it to a certain prostitue.  Indeed she put it on and came
 once and again to where that monk was.  But when he saw his own
 clothing, he recognized it as the one that he used to wear on
 feast days.  He sorrowed intensely and, going into his cell,
 said: "Truly, what I did did not please God, and he has not
 accepted my devotion, seeing that my cloak, which I used to wear
 on feast days, has come into such hands as these, and a mere
 prostitue wears it."

Prae tristitia vero non comedit die illa. Nocte vero cum
obdormisset vidit Dominum nostrum Iesum Christum indutum
vestimentum suum quod pauperi dedit et introeuntem in cellam suam
et dicentem sibi: "Frater, frater." Qui ut aspexit, vidit lucem
magnam dixitque: "Quis es, Domine?" Qui dixit ei: "Aspice in me."
Ut autem prospexit, dixit ei: "Cognoscis hoc?" Respondit: "Etiam,
Domine; colobium meum est." Ait illi: "Ego sum Iesus. Non iam
tristeris, sed gaude et laetare et age gratias Deo. Ex quo enim
illud dedisti pauperi, ego accepi." Et laetatus monachus valde in
benignitate Domini nostri Iesu Christi, qui non permisit eum
torqueri a cogitationibus, sed certificabat eum in verbo quod
ante praedixerat, quia "quod uni ex minimis meis fecistis, mihi
fecistis."

 Indeed, on account of his sorrow he did not eat that that.  But
 that night, when he had fallen asleep he saw our Lord Jesus
 Christ, clothed in the garment that he had given the poor man,
 who had entered his cell and said to him: "Brother, brother." And
 as he looked, he saw a great light and said: "Who are you, Lord?"
 and he said to him: "Look at me." But as he stared, he said to
 him: "Do you recognize this?" He answered: "Even so, Lord: the
 cloak is mine." He said to him: "I am Jesus. Sorrow no more, but
 rejoice and be of good cheer and give thanks to God.  For from
 this that you have given to the poor man, I have accepted." And
 the monk took great joy in the kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ,
 who did not allow him to be tormented by his thoughts, but gave
 him assurance in his word what he had foretold, that "what you
 have done to the least of mine, you have done to me."
