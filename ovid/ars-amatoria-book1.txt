Siquis in hoc artem populo non novit amandi,
     Hoc legat et lecto carmine doctus amet.
Arte citae veloque rates remoque moventur,
     Arte leves currus: arte regendus amor.
Curribus Automedon lentisque erat aptus habenis,               
     Tiphys in Haemonia puppe magister erat:
Me Venus artificem tenero praefecit Amori;
     Tiphys et Automedon dicar Amoris ego.
Ille quidem ferus est et qui mihi saepe repugnet:
     Sed puer est, aetas mollis et apta regi.               
Phillyrides puerum cithara perfecit Achillem,
     Atque animos placida contudit arte feros.
Qui totiens socios, totiens exterruit hostes,
     Creditur annosum pertimuisse senem.
Quas Hector sensurus erat, poscente magistro               
     Verberibus iussas praebuit ille manus.
Aeacidae Chiron, ego sum praeceptor Amoris:
     Saevus uterque puer, natus uterque dea.
Sed tamen et tauri cervix oneratur aratro,
     Frenaque magnanimi dente teruntur equi;               


If anyone in this nation has not learned the art of loving,
 Let him read and love, trained by this excellent poem.
swift boats are set in motion with art and sail and oar,
 fleet chariots by art: love should be ruled by art.
Automedon was ready with chariots and pliant reins,
 Tiphys was the master in the ship's stern in Thessaly:
Venus put me, an artist, in charge of tender Love:
 I will be called the Tiphys and Automedon of Love.
It is untamed indeed, and often would resist me:
 But it's a child, an age that's tender and fit for a king.
Chiron finished the boy Achilles with a lyre,
 And subdued his untamed spirit with a gentle art.
He who frightened his companions as often as his foes,
 It is thought that the old man, full of years, had been afraid.
Hector was about to feel, as his teacher required,
 he held out his demanded hands to the lash.
Aeacides' Chiron, I am Love's instructor:
 Whether an untamed boy, or offspring of a goddess.
But still and a bull's neck is burdened by the plow,
 And a bridle's bit is worn away by a noble horse's teeth;
