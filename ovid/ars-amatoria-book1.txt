Siquis in hoc artem populo non novit amandi,
     Hoc legat et lecto carmine doctus amet.
Arte citae veloque rates remoque moventur,
     Arte leves currus: arte regendus amor.
Curribus Automedon lentisque erat aptus habenis,               
     Tiphys in Haemonia puppe magister erat:
Me Venus artificem tenero praefecit Amori;
     Tiphys et Automedon dicar Amoris ego.
Ille quidem ferus est et qui mihi saepe repugnet:
     Sed puer est, aetas mollis et apta regi.               
Phillyrides puerum cithara perfecit Achillem,
     Atque animos placida contudit arte feros.
Qui totiens socios, totiens exterruit hostes,
     Creditur annosum pertimuisse senem.
Quas Hector sensurus erat, poscente magistro               
     Verberibus iussas praebuit ille manus.
Aeacidae Chiron, ego sum praeceptor Amoris:
     Saevus uterque puer, natus uterque dea.
Sed tamen et tauri cervix oneratur aratro,
     Frenaque magnanimi dente teruntur equi;               

If anyone in this nation has not learned the art of loving,
 Let him read this poem and, instructed by reading it, love.
Swift boats are skillfully set in motion with sail and oar,
 fleet chariots by skill: love should be managed by skill.
Automedon was well suited for chariots and pliant reins,
 Tiphys was the master in the ship's stern in Thessaly:
Venus put me, an artist, in charge of tender Love:
 I will be called the Tiphys and Automedon of Love.
He is wild indeed, and often would resist me:
 But he's a child, an age that's tender and ought to be controlled.
Chiron polished the boy Achilles with a lyre,
 And subdued his untamed spirit with a gentle art.
He who frightened his companions as often as his foes,
 It's thought that he feared the old man, full of years.
And Hector would feel it, when, as his teacher demanded,
 he held out his hands, commanded for the lash.
Like Chiron to Achilles, I am Love's instructor:
 both boys wild, and the a goddess' child.
But even a bull's neck is burdened by the plow,
 And a bridle's bit is worn away by a noble horse's teeth;


Et mihi cedet Amor, quamvis mea vulneret arcu
Pectora, iactatas excutiatque faces.
Quo me fixit Amor, quo me violentius ussit,
Hoc melior facti vulneris ultor ero:
Non ego, Phoebe, datas a te mihi mentiar artes,
Nec nos aeriae voce monemur avis,
Nec mihi sunt visae Clio Cliusque sorores
Servanti pecudes vallibus, Ascra, tuis:
Usus opus movet hoc: vati parete perito;
Vera canam: coeptis, mater Amoris, ades!
Este procul, vittae tenues, insigne pudoris,
Quaeque tegis medios, instita longa, pedes.
Nos venerem tutam concessaque furta canemus,
Inque meo nullum carmine crimen erit.
Principio, quod amare velis, reperire labora,
Qui nova nunc primum miles in arma venis.
Proximus huic labor est placitam exorare puellam:
Tertius, ut longo tempore duret amor.
Hic modus, haec nostro signabitur area curru:
Haec erit admissa meta terenda rota.

And Love will yield to me, despite wounding my breast
with his bow, and flinging burning brands of love.
How Love transfixed me, how violently he burned me,
I'll be a better avenger for the wound that was caused by him:
I will not lie, Apollo, about the skills you've given me,
nor are we advised by the voice of a high-flying bird,
nor were Clio and her sisters seen by me
watching over your sheep in the valleys, Ascra:
practice stirs this work: attend the skillful seer;
May I sing the truth: aid me, mother of Love, with this undertaking!
Off with you, vestal fillets, the emblem of chastity,
and you who hide your feet under the hems of your long gowns.
We'll sing the sight of venery and forbidden dalliances,
say that no reproach will come from my poem.
From the start, because you wish to love, take pains to learn.
First you are a soldier, coming into fresh arms.
Second, the toil for this man is to win over a pleasing maid:
Third, as Love endures for a long time.
In this way, this course will be marked by our chariot:
This grinding wheel will be urged on by the turning post.
