inSiquis in hoc artem populo non novit amandi,
     Hoc legat et lecto carmine doctus amet.
Arte citae veloque rates remoque moventur,
     Arte leves currus: arte regendus amor.
Curribus Automedon lentisque erat aptus habenis,               
     Tiphys in Haemonia puppe magister erat:
Me Venus artificem tenero praefecit Amori;
     Tiphys et Automedon dicar Amoris ego.
Ille quidem ferus est et qui mihi saepe repugnet:
     Sed puer est, aetas mollis et apta regi.               
Phillyrides puerum cithara perfecit Achillem,
     Atque animos placida contudit arte feros.
Qui totiens socios, totiens exterruit hostes,
     Creditur annosum pertimuisse senem.
Quas Hector sensurus erat, poscente magistro               
     Verberibus iussas praebuit ille manus.
Aeacidae Chiron, ego sum praeceptor Amoris:
     Saevus uterque puer, natus uterque dea.
Sed tamen et tauri cervix oneratur aratro,
     Frenaque magnanimi dente teruntur equi;               

If anyone in this nation has not learned the art of loving,
 Let him read this poem and, instructed by reading it, love.
Swift boats are skillfully set in motion with sail and oar,
 fleet chariots by skill: love should be managed by skill.
Automedon was well suited for chariots and pliant reins,
 Tiphys was the master in the ship's stern in Thessaly:
Venus put me, an artist, in charge of tender Love:
 I will be called the Tiphys and Automedon of Love.
He is wild indeed, and often would resist me:
 But he's a child, an age that's tender and ought to be controlled.
Chiron polished the boy Achilles with a lyre,
 And subdued his untamed spirit with a gentle art.
He who frightened his companions as often as his foes,
 It's thought that he feared the old man, full of years.
And Hector would feel it, when, as his teacher demanded,
 he held out his hands, commanded for the lash.
Like Chiron to Achilles, I am Love's instructor:
 both boys wild, and the a goddess' child.
But even a bull's neck is burdened by the plow,
 And a bridle's bit is worn away by a noble horse's teeth;


Et mihi cedet Amor, quamvis mea vulneret arcu
Pectora, iactatas excutiatque faces.
Quo me fixit Amor, quo me violentius ussit,
Hoc melior facti vulneris ultor ero:
Non ego, Phoebe, datas a te mihi mentiar artes,
Nec nos aeriae voce monemur avis,
Nec mihi sunt visae Clio Cliusque sorores
Servanti pecudes vallibus, Ascra, tuis:
Usus opus movet hoc: vati parete perito;
Vera canam: coeptis, mater Amoris, ades!
Este procul, vittae tenues, insigne pudoris,
Quaeque tegis medios, instita longa, pedes.
Nos venerem tutam concessaque furta canemus,
Inque meo nullum carmine crimen erit.
Principio, quod amare velis, reperire labora,
Qui nova nunc primum miles in arma venis.
Proximus huic labor est placitam exorare puellam:
Tertius, ut longo tempore duret amor.
Hic modus, haec nostro signabitur area curru:
Haec erit admissa meta terenda rota.

And Love will yield to me, despite wounding my breast
with his bow, and flinging burning brands of love.
However much Love has transfixed me, however violently he's burned me,
I'll avenge myself the more for the injury that he has done me:
I won't pretend, Apollo, that you gave these skills to me,
nor was I advised by the song of a high-flying bird,
nor did Clio and her sisters appear to me
while I watched over the sheep in your valleys, Ascra.
Experience sets this work in motion: listen to the skilled poet;
I will sing the truth: aid me, mother of Love, with this undertaking!
Off with you, vestal fillets, emblems of chastity,
and you, the long gown that hides half of the feet.
We'll sing of protected venery and permitted dalliances,
don't tell me that any reproach will arise from my poem.
First, because you wish to love, take pains to learn,
you who are a soldier, coming into new arms.
Next, your task is to win over a lass who pleases you:
Thirdly, for Love to endure for a long time.
This way, this course will be marked by my chariot:
My grinding wheel will scrape this turning post.


Dum licet, et loris passim potes ire solutis,
     Elige cui dicas 'tu mihi sola places.'
Haec tibi non tenues veniet delapsa per auras:
     Quaerenda est oculis apta puella tuis.
Scit bene venator, cervis ubi retia tendat,               
     Scit bene, qua frendens valle moretur aper;
Aucupibus noti frutices; qui sustinet hamos,
     Novit quae multo pisce natentur aquae:
Tu quoque, materiam longo qui quaeris amori,
     Ante frequens quo sit disce puella loco.               
Non ego quaerentem vento dare vela iubebo,
     Nec tibi, ut invenias, longa terenda via est.
Andromedan Perseus nigris portarit ab Indis,
     Raptaque sit Phrygio Graia puella viro,
Tot tibi tamque dabit formosas Roma puellas,               
     'Haec habet' ut dicas 'quicquid in orbe fuit.'
Gargara quot segetes, quot habet Methymna racemos,
     Aequore quot pisces, fronde teguntur aves,
Quot caelum stellas, tot habet tua Roma puellas:
     Mater in Aeneae constitit urbe sui.                         

While it's allowed, and you can ride hither and yon with loosened reins,
 choose whom you would tell 'Only you please me.'
She won't flow down through gentle breezes to come to you:
 it's OK to spy out a suitable lass with your eyes.
The hunter well knows where to lay his nets for deer,
 he well knows which valley the tooth-gnashing boar waits in;
the shrubbery is known to fowlers; the man who set hooks
 has learned which waters are swum by a great fish:
likewise, you who seek the chance for lasting love,
 first off, learn what place a lass frequents.
I'll not command you, the seeker, to put your sails to the wind,
 nor is it for you to find her by a long and wearying road.
Perseus bore Andromeda away from the black Indus,
 and the Greek maiden was carried off by the Phrygian man,
Rome will give you just as beautiful lasses, so that you'll say,
 'This city has whatever was in the world.'
As much grain that Gargara has, as many grapes in Methymna,
 as many fish in the sea, and birds in the bush,
as many stars in the sky, your Rome has that many lasses:
 Aeneas' mother (Venus) still lives in her son's city.


Seu caperis primis et adhuc crescentibus annis,
     Ante oculos veniet vera puella tuos:
Sive cupis iuvenem, iuvenes tibi mille placebunt.
     Cogeris voti nescius esse tui:
Seu te forte iuvat sera et sapientior aetas,               
     Hoc quoque, crede mihi, plenius agmen erit.
Tu modo Pompeia lentus spatiare sub umbra,
     Cum sol Herculei terga leonis adit:
Aut ubi muneribus nati sua munera mater
     Addidit, externo marmore dives opus.               
Nec tibi vitetur quae, priscis sparsa tabellis,
     Porticus auctoris Livia nomen habet:
Quaque parare necem miseris patruelibus ausae
     Belides et stricto stat ferus ense pater.
Nec te praetereat Veneri ploratus Adonis,               
     Cultaque Iudaeo septima sacra Syro.
Nec fuge linigerae Memphitica templa iuvencae:
     Multas illa facit, quod fuit ipsa Iovi.
Et fora conveniunt (quis credere possit?) amori:
     Flammaque in arguto saepe reperta foro:            


If you're captivated by the first growing years,
 a genuine girl will come before your eyes:
or if you long for a young adult, a thousand of them will please you.
 You'll have no idea how to make your choice:
or if by chance a later and wiser age delights you,
 there'll still be, believe me, a fuller band of them here.
Only amble slowly under Pompey's shadow,
 as the sun nears the back of Hercules' lion:
or where a mother has added her own gifts of those of her child,
 a work rich with foreign marble.
And don't forget the portico that's covered with ancient tablets,
 that holds its founder's name, Livia:
or where the Belides dare to prepare death for their wretched cousins
 and their father stands ready with his sword drawn.
And don't let Adonis, mourned by Venus, pass you by,
 nor the seventh day, revered as sacred by the Syrian Jew.
And don't avoid Memphis' temple for a heifer clothed in linen:
 she makes many women what she herself was for Jove.
Even the courts are suited (who could believe it?) for love:
 and a spark is often discovered in a noisy court.

Subdita qua Veneris facto de marmore templo
     Appias expressis aera pulsat aquis,
Illo saepe loco capitur consultus Amori,
     Quique aliis cavit, non cavet ipse sibi:
Illo saepe loco desunt sua verba diserto,               
     Resque novae veniunt, causaque agenda sua est.
Hunc Venus e templis, quae sunt confinia, ridet:
     Qui modo patronus, nunc cupit esse cliens.
Sed tu praecipue curvis venare theatris:
     Haec loca sunt voto fertiliora tuo.               
Illic invenies quod ames, quod ludere possis,
     Quodque semel tangas, quodque tenere velis.
Ut redit itque frequens longum formica per agmen,
     Granifero solitum cum vehit ore cibum,
Aut ut apes saltusque suos et olentia nactae               
     Pascua per flores et thyma summa volant,
Sic ruit ad celebres cultissima femina ludos:
     Copia iudicium saepe morata meum est.
Spectatum veniunt, veniunt spectentur ut ipsae:
     Ille locus casti damna pudoris habet.                    

Where, placed under the marble temple of Venus,
 the Appian nymph beats the air with splashing waters,
there the lawyer often is decieved by Love,
 and the one who defends others does not defend himself:
there his elegant words often fail him,
 and a new case comes, and his own suit must be brought.
Venus mocks him from her nearby temple:
 he who was recently the advocate, now wishes to be the client.
But you should particularly hunt in the curved theaters:
 these places are more fruitful to your desire.
There you will find what you can love, what you can trifle with,
 and also what you can touch, and what you'd want to hold.
Just as the ant returns along its long marching column,
 bearing its customary food in its grain-bearing mouth,
or as bees, having found their woodlands and scented pastures,
 fly through flowers and the tallest thyme,
so the most elegant woman runs to celebrated games:
 I often have to put off my judgment because of the wealth of choices.
They come to see, they come to be themselves seen:
 this place holds danger for chaste modesty.


Primus sollicitos fecisti, Romule, ludos,
     Cum iuvit viduos rapta Sabina viros.
Tunc neque marmoreo pendebant vela theatro,
     Nec fuerant liquido pulpita rubra croco;
Illic quas tulerant nemorosa Palatia, frondes               
     Simpliciter positae, scena sine arte fuit;
In gradibus sedit populus de caespite factis,
     Qualibet hirsutas fronde tegente comas.
Respiciunt, oculisque notant sibi quisque puellam
     Quam velit, et tacito pectore multa movent.               
Dumque, rudem praebente modum tibicine Tusco,
     Ludius aequatam ter pede pulsat humum,
In medio plausu (plausus tunc arte carebant)
     Rex populo praedae signa petita dedit.
Protinus exiliunt, animum clamore fatentes,               
     Virginibus cupidas iniciuntque manus.
Ut fugiunt aquilas, timidissima turba, columbae,
     Ut fugit invisos agna novella lupos:
Sic illae timuere viros sine more ruentes;
     Constitit in nulla qui fuit ante color.                                

You, Romulus, first upset the games,
 when the plundered Sabine women delighted unwed men.
No curtains hung from a marble theater then,
 nor was the stage reddened with pure saffron;
The stage was simply and artlessly strewn with leafy garlands,
 that had been brought from the wooded Palatine;
People sat on steps formed from turf,
 with leaves covering untrimmed hair every which way.
They look on, and with their eyes they mark for themselves whichever lass
 they desire, and are greatly stirred in their heart of hearts.
Meanwhile, with the Tuscan piper playing wild music,
 a dancer beats the level ground thrice with his foot,
Amidst the applause (at that time applause was lacking skill)
 the king gave the people the desired sign of plunder.
At once they leap up, acknowledging their hearts with a shout,
 and seize the maidens with lecherous hands.
As doves, in a fearful commotion, flee from eagles,
 as the young lamb flees the hateful wolf:
So those women feared the men who were lawlessly rushing at them;
 not one kept the color that she'd had before.


Nam timor unus erat, facies non una timoris:
     Pars laniat crines, pars sine mente sedet;
Altera maesta silet, frustra vocat altera matrem:
     Haec queritur, stupet haec; haec manet, illa fugit;
Ducuntur raptae, genialis praeda, puellae,               
     Et potuit multas ipse decere timor.
Siqua repugnarat nimium comitemque negabat,
     Sublatam cupido vir tulit ipse sinu,
Atque ita 'quid teneros lacrimis corrumpis ocellos?
     Quod matri pater est, hoc tibi' dixit 'ero.'               
Romule, militibus scisti dare commoda solus:
     Haec mihi si dederis commoda, miles ero.
Scilicet ex illo sollemnia more theatra
     Nunc quoque formosis insidiosa manent.
Nec te nobilium fugiat certamen equorum;               
     Multa capax populi commoda Circus habet.
Nil opus est digitis, per quos arcana loquaris,
     Nec tibi per nutus accipienda nota est:
Proximus a domina, nullo prohibente, sedeto,
     Iunge tuum lateri qua potes usque latus;


For they had a single fear, with more than one form:
 some tear their hair, some sit in a stupor;
one sorrowing woman is silent, another calls her mother in vain:
 this one protests, this one is stunned: this one tarries, that one flees;
the plundered lasses, the nuptial booty, are led away,
 and fear could itself befit many women.
If any fought too hard and refused her comrade,
 in a passion that man snatched her up against his breast,
and so 'Why do you ruin your tender eyes with tears?
 What your father is to your mother, this,' he said 'I'll be to you.'
O Romulus, you alone learned to give soldiers rewards:
 if you'll give me these rewards, I'll be a soldier.
Of course because of that custom solemn theaters
 are treacherous for beautiful women even now.
And don't let a contest of noble horses fly from you;
 the state's capacious race course holds many rewards.
There's no need for fingers for telling secrets,
 nor was the acceptance made known by you through nods:
Sit next to the lady, if no-one prevents it,
 side by side, as close as you can get;


Et bene, quod cogit, si nolis, linea iungi,
     Quod tibi tangenda est lege puella loci.
Hic tibi quaeratur socii sermonis origo,
     Et moveant primos publica verba sonos.
Cuius equi veniant, facito, studiose, requiras:               
     Nec mora, quisquis erit, cui favet illa, fave.
At cum pompa frequens caelestibus ibit eburnis,
     Tu Veneri dominae plaude favente manu;
Utque fit, in gremium pulvis si forte puellae
     Deciderit, digitis excutiendus erit:               
Etsi nullus erit pulvis, tamen excute nullum:
     Quaelibet officio causa sit apta tuo.
Pallia si terra nimium demissa iacebunt,
     Collige, et inmunda sedulus effer humo;
Protinus, officii pretium, patiente puella               
     Contingent oculis crura videnda tuis.
Respice praeterea, post vos quicumque sedebit,
     Ne premat opposito mollia terga genu.
Parva leves capiunt animos: fuit utile multis
     Pulvinum facili composuisse manu.

And that's OK, because you're forced, willing or not, to be crowded together,
 that by the rules of the place you need to touch the lass.
Here seek the start of a friendly conversation,
 and let public words commence your first sounds.
You should eagerly ferret out whose horses are running:
 and without delay whoever it is, favor those that she favors.
But as the regular procession passes, with the celestrial ivory statues,
 Applaud the Lady Venus with your favoring hand;
And as happens, if perchance dust fell into the lass's lap,
 With your fingers you must shake it off:
Even if there is no dust, nevertheless shake off that nothing:
 Let the chance fall to your service, however apt.
If her cloak falls down too low upon the ground,
 Painstakingly gather it, and lift it away from the foul dirt;
At once, as the reward your service, the lass permitting,
 Your eyes will light upon her shins.
Look behind you as well, whoever sits behind the two of you,
 To make sure he isn't pressing against her butt with his knee.
Little things capture trifling souls: arranging a cushion
 with an easy hand has been useful to many.
 

Profuit et tenui ventos movisse tabella,
     Et cava sub tenerum scamna dedisse pedem.
Hos aditus Circusque novo praebebit amori,
     Sparsaque sollicito tristis harena foro.
Illa saepe puer Veneris pugnavit harena,               
     Et qui spectavit vulnera, vulnus habet.
Dum loquitur tangitque manum poscitque libellum
     Et quaerit posito pignore, vincat uter,
Saucius ingemuit telumque volatile sensit,
     Et pars spectati muneris ipse fuit.               
Quid, modo cum belli navalis imagine Caesar
     Persidas induxit Cecropiasque rates?
Nempe ab utroque mari iuvenes, ab utroque puellae
     Venere, atque ingens orbis in Urbe fuit.
Quis non invenit turba, quod amaret, in illa?               
     Eheu, quam multos advena torsit amor!
Ecce, parat Caesar domito quod defuit orbi
     Addere: nunc, oriens ultime, noster eris.
Parthe, dabis poenas: Crassi gaudete sepulti,
     Signaque barbaricas non bene passa manus.

It was also useful to stir the breezes with a slender fan,
 and to put a concave stool under her tender foot.
And the Circus will offer these approaches to a new love,
 and the sad sand, scattered over the churned up Forum.
Venus' boy often did battle on that sand,
 and he who has observed wounds, has got them.
He speaks and touches her hand while asking for a program
 and asks, in placing his bet, whichever one wins,
a wounded man felt a flying dart and groaned,
 and was himself part of the observed spectacle.
What, did Caesar bring in Persian and Athenian ships
 in an imitation of a naval battle?
For sure, both lads and lasses came from every sea,
 and there was a vast world in the City.
Who couldn't find someone to love in that commotion?
 Alas! How a foreign love has so tormented many men!
Look, Caesar is ready to give the conquered world what it lacked:
 now, remotest East, you'll be ours.
O Parthian, you'll pay the penalty: rejoice, buried Crassuses,
 and standards that badly endured foreign hands.

Ultor adest, primisque ducem profitetur in annis,
     Bellaque non puero tractat agenda puer.
Parcite natales timidi numerare deorum:
     Caesaribus virtus contigit ante diem.
Ingenium caeleste suis velocius annis               
     Surgit, et ignavae fert male damna morae.
Parvus erat, manibusque duos Tirynthius angues
     Pressit, et in cunis iam Iove dignus erat.
Nunc quoque qui puer es, quantus tum, Bacche, fuisti,
     Cum timuit thyrsos India victa tuos?               
Auspiciis annisque patris, puer, arma movebis,
     Et vinces annis auspiciisque patris:
Tale rudimentum tanto sub nomine debes,
     Nunc iuvenum princeps, deinde future senum;
Cum tibi sint fratres, fratres ulciscere laesos:               
     Cumque pater tibi sit, iura tuere patris.
Induit arma tibi genitor patriaeque tuusque:
     Hostis ab invito regna parente rapit;
Tu pia tela feres, sceleratas ille sagittas:
     Stabit pro signis iusque piumque tuis.

The avenger is at hand. The boy declares himself leader in his youthful years,
  and doesn't wage wars like a boy.
Forbear, timid men, from counting the birthdays of the gods:
  valor came to the Caesars early.
A celestrial nature grows more swiftly than its years,
  and doesn't bear the harm of idle delay well.
Hercules was small, and crushed two serpents with his hands,
  and in his crib was already worthy of Jove.
So too, Bacchus, you who are still a boy, how great were you then,
  when the conquered Indies dreaded your batons?
With the auspices and years of your father, boy, you'll rattle your arms,
  and will conquer with the years and and auspices of your father:
Under such a great name you owe such a commencement,
  now the foremost of young men, and will be the first of old ones;
since you have brothers, you'll avenge your wronged brothers:
  and since you have a father, see to the rights of your father.
Your father and your country's father have armed you:
  the enemy seizes kingdoms from a reluctant parent;
you'll bear righteous spears, and he defiled arrows:
  righteous law will stand before your standards.


Vincuntur causa Parthi: vincantur et armis;
     Eoas Latio dux meus addat opes.
Marsque pater Caesarque pater, date numen eunti:
     Nam deus e vobis alter es, alter eris.
Auguror, en, vinces; votivaque carmina reddam,               
     Et magno nobis ore sonandus eris.
Consistes, aciemque meis hortabere verbis;
     O desint animis ne mea verba tuis!
Tergaque Parthorum Romanaque pectora dicam,
     Telaque, ab averso quae iacit hostis equo.               
Qui fugis ut vincas, quid victo, Parthe, relinquis?
     Parthe, malum iam nunc Mars tuus omen habet.
Ergo erit illa dies, qua tu, pulcherrime rerum,
     Quattuor in niveis aureus ibis equis.
Ibunt ante duces onerati colla catenis,               
     Ne possint tuti, qua prius, esse fuga.
Spectabunt laeti iuvenes mixtaeque puellae,
     Diffundetque animos omnibus ista dies.
Atque aliqua ex illis cum regum nomina quaeret,
     Quae loca, qui montes, quaeve ferantur aquae,

The Parthians are defeated in their casue: may they be defeated by arms as well;
  may my commander add eastern wealth to Rome.
Both Father Mars and Father Caesar, give divine will to those who are going:
  for one of you is a god, and the other will be one.
Look here! I predict that you'll conquer; and I'll render votive songs,
  and you'll be trumpeted by us in a great speech.
You'll stand and exhort your battle line with my words;
  Oh, let my words not fail your courage!
And I'll name the Parthian backs and the Roman breasts,
  and the spears that the enemy hurls from a retreating horse.
You who flee to conquer, what do you leave to the defeated, Parthian?
  Parthian, your Mars has an evil omen just now.
Therefore that day will come, when you, the handsomest of the republic,
  will ride, glittering like gold, behind four snowy steeds.
Generals will walk before you, necks laden with chains, and watched,
  lest they could take to their heels, as they did before.
The rich youths and intermingled lasses will observe,
  and that day will cheer the hearts of all.
And when any of these lasses asks the names of the kings,
  or which places, mountains, or waters are borne,

Omnia responde, nec tantum siqua rogabit;
     Et quae nescieris, ut bene nota refer.
Hic est Euphrates, praecinctus harundine frontem:
     Cui coma dependet caerula, Tigris erit.
Hos facito Armenios; haec est Danaeia Persis:               
     Urbs in Achaemeniis vallibus ista fuit.
Ille vel ille, duces; et erunt quae nomina dicas,
     Si poteris, vere, si minus, apta tamen.
Dant etiam positis aditum convivia mensis:
     Est aliquid praeter vina, quod inde petas.               
Saepe illic positi teneris adducta lacertis
     Purpureus Bacchi cornua pressit Amor:
Vinaque cum bibulas sparsere Cupidinis alas,
     Permanet et capto stat gravis ille loco.
Ille quidem pennas velociter excutit udas:               
     Sed tamen et spargi pectus amore nocet.
Vina parant animos faciuntque caloribus aptos:
     Cura fugit multo diluiturque mero.
Tunc veniunt risus, tum pauper cornua sumit,
     Tum dolor et curae rugaque frontis abit.

Answer everything, and not just what she asks;
  even what you don't know, repeat it as something well known.
This is the Euphrates, girdled with reeds at the brow:
  this, with azure hair hanging down, will be the Tigris.
Come up with these Armenians; this is the Persian Danaeia:
  it was a city in the Achaemenian valleys.
That man or that one, are commanders; and will have whatever names you say,
  their real ones, if you can, if you cannot, apt ones nonetheless.
Banquets laid on tables also give you an entrance:
  anything other than wine is what you might ask from there.
Wine-red Love often used his tender arms to bear down on
  seated Bacchus' frowning horns:
and when wine bedews Cupid's thirsty wings,
  he, laden, stops and stays in the seat he's taken.
Indeed he quickly shakes out his wet feathers:
  and yet it does him harm to bedew his breast with love.
Wine supplies courage and raises men with passion:
  worry flees and is washed away with much unwatered wine.
Then laughter comes, then the poor man takes up the horn,
  then sorrow and cares and wrinkles of the brow depart.


Tunc aperit mentes aevo rarissima nostro
     Simplicitas, artes excutiente deo.
Illic saepe animos iuvenum rapuere puellae,
     Et Venus in vinis ignis in igne fuit.
Hic tu fallaci nimium ne crede lucernae:               
     Iudicio formae noxque merumque nocent.
Luce deas caeloque Paris spectavit aperto,
     Cum dixit Veneri 'vincis utramque, Venus.'
Nocte latent mendae, vitioque ignoscitur omni,
     Horaque formosam quamlibet illa facit.               
Consule de gemmis, de tincta murice lana,
     Consule de facie corporibusque diem.
Quid tibi femineos coetus venatibus aptos
     Enumerem? numero cedet harena meo.
Quid referam Baias, praetextaque litora velis,               
     Et quae de calido sulpure fumat aqua?
Hinc aliquis vulnus referens in pectore dixit
     'Non haec, ut fama est, unda salubris erat.'
Ecce suburbanae templum nemorale Dianae
     Partaque per gladios regna nocente manu:

Then candor, so rare nowadays, lays our minds bare,
  after the god shakes off our artifices.
The lasses then often snatched the hearts of young men,
  and Venus was in wines, a flame in flames.
Don't put all your faith in deceitful lamplight now:
  night and wine harm your judgment of beauty.
Paris observed the goddesses by day, and in the open,
  when he said to Venus 'You vanquish them both, Venus.'
Faults lie hidden in the night, and every blemish is overlooked,
  and that hour makes any woman beautiful.
Consult the day on jewels, on purple-dyed wool,
  consult it on faces and bodies.
Why should I count up all the ways to meet women for you?
  the grains of sand give way before the number of ways that I know.
Why should I call Baia to mind, and its shore, bordered with sails,
  and the water that reeks of hot sulphur?
Whoever carries a broken heart back from here has said
  'Those waves weren't as healthful as they're said to be.'
Behold the temple of Diana, in a grove near the city,
  and kingdoms begot with swords and a harmful hand:


Illa, quod est virgo, quod tela Cupidinis odit,
     Multa dedit populo vulnera, multa dabit.
Hactenus, unde legas quod ames, ubi retia ponas,
     Praecipit imparibus vecta Thalea rotis.
Nunc tibi, quae placuit, quas sit capienda per artes,               
     Dicere praecipuae molior artis opus.
Quisquis ubique, viri, dociles advertite mentes,
     Pollicitisque favens, vulgus, adeste meis.
Prima tuae menti veniat fiducia, cunctas
     Posse capi; capies, tu modo tende plagas.               
Vere prius volucres taceant, aestate cicadae,
     Maenalius lepori det sua terga canis,
Femina quam iuveni blande temptata repugnet:
     Haec quoque, quam poteris credere nolle, volet.
Utque viro furtiva venus, sic grata puellae:               
     Vir male dissimulat: tectius illa cupit.
Conveniat maribus, ne quam nos ante rogemus,
     Femina iam partes victa rogantis agat.
Mollibus in pratis admugit femina tauro:
     Femina cornipedi semper adhinnit equo.

She, because she's a virgin, because she hates Cupid's darts,
  inflicted many wounds on the nation, and will inflict more.
Thus far, Thalea, borne on unequal wheels, has taught you where
  to pick the one to love, and where lay your nets.
Now I endeaver to describe a task of particular skill -
  how the woman who tickled your fancy might be taken through those arts.
Whoever and wherever you are, men, pay attention with tractable minds,
  and, you rabble, if you incline towards my promises, then stick around.
First let assurance come to your mind, they'll
  all be ripe for the plucking; you'll get her; only spread your nets.
Indeed, the birds would sooner fall silent, the cicadas in summer,
  Maenalus' dog would turn tail to a hare,
than would a tempted woman resist a flattering young man:
  she wants it too, though you can't let yourself believe it.
As pleasing a furtive sale is for a man, so it is for a lass:
  a man dissembles poorly: she desires more covertly.
Were it be meet for men, we'd ask for naught before,
  the conquered woman would still perform the asking role.
In pleasant meadows a cow lows to a bull:
  a mare always whinnies to a hoofed horse.


Parcior in nobis nec tam furiosa libido:
     Legitimum finem flamma virilis habet.
Byblida quid referam, vetito quae fratris amore
     Arsit et est laqueo fortiter ulta nefas?
Myrrha patrem, sed non qua filia debet, amavit,               
     Et nunc obducto cortice pressa latet:
Illius lacrimis, quas arbore fundit odora,
     Unguimur, et dominae nomina gutta tenet.
Forte sub umbrosis nemorosae vallibus Idae
     Candidus, armenti gloria, taurus erat,               
Signatus tenui media inter cornua nigro:
     Una fuit labes, cetera lactis erant.
Illum Cnosiadesque Cydoneaeque iuvencae
     Optarunt tergo sustinuisse suo.
Pasiphae fieri gaudebat adultera tauri;               
     Invida formosas oderat illa boves.
Nota cano: non hoc, centum quae sustinet urbes,
     Quamvis sit mendax, Creta negare potest.
Ipsa novas frondes et prata tenerrima tauro
     Fertur inadsueta subsecuisse manu.

Desire is more sparing in us, and not so frantic:
  the manly flame has a lawful limit.
Why should I recall Byblis, who blazed with forbidden love for her brother
  and bravely avenged her sin with a noose?
Myrrha loved her father, but not as a daughter ought,
  and now she lies hidden, squeezed tight by wrinkled bark:
with her tears, that pour out of the fragrant tree,
  we are anointed, and a drop holds its lady's names.
By chance, down in the shady valleys of wooded Mount Ida
  there was a white bull, the glory of the herd,
marked with a thin black spot between its horns:
  this was its only fault, the rest were like milk.
The heifers of both Cnosiades and Cydonia
  chose him to bear on their backs.
Pasiphae rejoiced to have lost her maidenhead to a bull;
  that jealous woman had hated the beautiful cows.
I sing of what's well known: Crete, that supports a hundred cities,
  although she is deceitful, can not deny this.
It's said that she cut fresh leaves and the tenderest meadow grass
  for the bull, with her own unaccustomed hand.


It comes armentis, nec ituram cura moratur
     Coniugis, et Minos a bove victus erat.
Quo tibi, Pasiphae, pretiosas sumere vestes?
     Ille tuus nullas sentit adulter opes.
Quid tibi cum speculo, montana armenta petenti?               
     Quid totiens positas fingis, inepta, comas?
Crede tamen speculo, quod te negat esse iuvencam.
     Quam cuperes fronti cornua nata tuae!
Sive placet Minos, nullus quaeratur adulter:
     Sive virum mavis fallere, falle viro!               
In nemus et saltus thalamo regina relicto
     Fertur, ut Aonio concita Baccha deo.
A, quotiens vaccam vultu spectavit iniquo,
     Et dixit 'domino cur placet ista meo?
Aspice, ut ante ipsum teneris exultet in herbis:               
     Nec dubito, quin se stulta decere putet.'
Dixit, et ingenti iamdudum de grege duci
     Iussit et inmeritam sub iuga curva trahi,
Aut cadere ante aras commentaque sacra coegit,
     Et tenuit laeta paelicis exta manu.

She goes, a companion of the herd, and no care for her spouse holds her back
  from going, and Minos was bested by a bull.
What's it to you, Pasiphae, to enjoy your costly gowns?
  Your paramour knows nothing of wealth.
What do you need with a mirror, seeking a mountain herd?
  Why do you so often, you silly thing, rearrange your hair?
But still, trust your mirror, that denies that you're a heifer.
  How badly do you wish horns to spring from your forehead!
If Minos pleases you, then let no paramour be sought:
  or if you'd rather deceive your husband, deceive him with a man!
From the the forsaken bedroom the queen is borne to the forest and woodland,
  as the roused Bacchanite to the Aonian god.
Ah! How often did she look at a cow with a hostile mien,
  and say 'Why does this animal please my lord?
Look, as she leaps about before him on the tender grass:
  and I have no doubt, that the foolish thing thinks herself becoming.'
She spoke, and at once ordered her to be led from the vast herd
  and to be dragged, all innocent, under a bent yoke,
or compeled her to fall before the altars and contrived sacred rites,
  and held the entrails of her rival in her joyful hand.


Paelicibus quotiens placavit numina caesis,
     Atque ait, exta tenens 'ite, placete meo!'
Et modo se Europen fieri, modo postulat Io,
     Altera quod bos est, altera vecta bove.
Hanc tamen implevit, vacca deceptus acerna,               
     Dux gregis, et partu proditus auctor erat.
Cressa Thyesteo si se abstinuisset amore
     (Et quantum est uno posse carere viro?),
Non medium rupisset iter, curruque retorto
     Auroram versis Phoebus adisset equis.               
Filia purpureos Niso furata capillos
     Pube premit rabidos inguinibusque canes.
Qui Martem terra, Neptunum effugit in undis,
     Coniugis Atrides victima dira fuit.
Cui non defleta est Ephyraeae flamma Creusae,               
     Et nece natorum sanguinolenta parens?
Flevit Amyntorides per inania lumina Phoenix:
     Hippolytum pavidi diripuistis equi.
Quid fodis inmeritis, Phineu, sua lumina natis?
     Poena reversura est in caput ista tuum.

How often has she placated divine wills with slaughtered concubines,
  and said, holding their entrails, 'go on then, please my lover!'
And claims that she has become now Europa, now Io,
  the one because she is a cow, the other because she was borne by one.
Nevertheless, the herd's commander, deceived by a cow carved from maple,
  impregnated her, and by the offspring was the father revealed.
If Crete had held back from her love for Thyestes
  (And how hard is it to live without a single man?),
she wouldn't have broken the middle journey, and with a chariot turned back
  Phoebus would have gone to dawn with turned horses.
Nisus' stolen daughter presses her father's frenzied purple hair
  in her crotch  and dogs/you will sing??.
He who fled Mars by land, fled Neptune on the waves,
  Atreus's wife was an awful victim.
who was not lamented by the flame of Creusa of Ephyra,
  and the parent by the bloody murder of the children?
Phoenix, son of Amyntor, wept with sightless eyes:
  panicked horses, y'all ripped Hippolytus to pieces.
Why do you wound innocent children, Phineus, of their eyes?
  the penalty will be repaid on that head of yours.
