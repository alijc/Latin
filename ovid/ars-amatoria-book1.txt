Siquis in hoc artem populo non novit amandi,
     Hoc legat et lecto carmine doctus amet.
Arte citae veloque rates remoque moventur,
     Arte leves currus: arte regendus amor.
Curribus Automedon lentisque erat aptus habenis,               
     Tiphys in Haemonia puppe magister erat:
Me Venus artificem tenero praefecit Amori;
     Tiphys et Automedon dicar Amoris ego.
Ille quidem ferus est et qui mihi saepe repugnet:
     Sed puer est, aetas mollis et apta regi.               
Phillyrides puerum cithara perfecit Achillem,
     Atque animos placida contudit arte feros.
Qui totiens socios, totiens exterruit hostes,
     Creditur annosum pertimuisse senem.
Quas Hector sensurus erat, poscente magistro               
     Verberibus iussas praebuit ille manus.
Aeacidae Chiron, ego sum praeceptor Amoris:
     Saevus uterque puer, natus uterque dea.
Sed tamen et tauri cervix oneratur aratro,
     Frenaque magnanimi dente teruntur equi;               

If anyone in this nation has not learned the art of loving,
 Let him read this poem and, instructed by reading it, love.
Swift boats are skillfully set in motion with sail and oar,
 fleet chariots by skill: love should be managed by skill.
Automedon was well suited for chariots and pliant reins,
 Tiphys was the master in the ship's stern in Thessaly:
Venus put me, an artist, in charge of tender Love:
 I will be called the Tiphys and Automedon of Love.
He is wild indeed, and often would resist me:
 But he's a child, an age that's tender and ought to be controlled.
Chiron polished the boy Achilles with a lyre,
 And subdued his untamed spirit with a gentle art.
He who frightened his companions as often as his foes,
 It's thought that he feared the old man, full of years.
And Hector would feel it, when, as his teacher demanded,
 he held out his hands, commanded for the lash.
Like Chiron to Achilles, I am Love's instructor:
 both boys wild, and the a goddess' child.
But even a bull's neck is burdened by the plow,
 And a bridle's bit is worn away by a noble horse's teeth;


Et mihi cedet Amor, quamvis mea vulneret arcu
Pectora, iactatas excutiatque faces.
Quo me fixit Amor, quo me violentius ussit,
Hoc melior facti vulneris ultor ero:
Non ego, Phoebe, datas a te mihi mentiar artes,
Nec nos aeriae voce monemur avis,
Nec mihi sunt visae Clio Cliusque sorores
Servanti pecudes vallibus, Ascra, tuis:
Usus opus movet hoc: vati parete perito;
Vera canam: coeptis, mater Amoris, ades!
Este procul, vittae tenues, insigne pudoris,
Quaeque tegis medios, instita longa, pedes.
Nos venerem tutam concessaque furta canemus,
Inque meo nullum carmine crimen erit.
Principio, quod amare velis, reperire labora,
Qui nova nunc primum miles in arma venis.
Proximus huic labor est placitam exorare puellam:
Tertius, ut longo tempore duret amor.
Hic modus, haec nostro signabitur area curru:
Haec erit admissa meta terenda rota.

And Love will yield to me, despite wounding my breast
with his bow, and flinging burning brands of love.
However much Love has transfixed me, however violently he's burned me,
I'll avenge myself the more for the injury that he has done me:
I won't pretend, Apollo, that you gave these skills to me,
nor was I advised by the song of a high-flying bird,
nor did Clio and her sisters appear to me
while I watched over the sheep in your valleys, Ascra.
Experience sets this work in motion: listen to the skilled poet;
I will sing the truth: aid me, mother of Love, with this undertaking!
Off with you, vestal fillets, emblems of chastity,
and you, the long gown that hides half of the feet.
We'll sing of protected venery and permitted dalliances,
don't tell me that any reproach will arise from my poem.
First, because you wish to love, take pains to learn,
you who are a soldier, coming into new arms.
Next, your task is to win over a lass who pleases you:
Thirdly, for Love to endure for a long time.
This way, this course will be marked by my chariot:
My grinding wheel will scrape this turning post.


Dum licet, et loris passim potes ire solutis,
     Elige cui dicas 'tu mihi sola places.'
Haec tibi non tenues veniet delapsa per auras:
     Quaerenda est oculis apta puella tuis.
Scit bene venator, cervis ubi retia tendat,               
     Scit bene, qua frendens valle moretur aper;
Aucupibus noti frutices; qui sustinet hamos,
     Novit quae multo pisce natentur aquae:
Tu quoque, materiam longo qui quaeris amori,
     Ante frequens quo sit disce puella loco.               
Non ego quaerentem vento dare vela iubebo,
     Nec tibi, ut invenias, longa terenda via est.
Andromedan Perseus nigris portarit ab Indis,
     Raptaque sit Phrygio Graia puella viro,
Tot tibi tamque dabit formosas Roma puellas,               
     'Haec habet' ut dicas 'quicquid in orbe fuit.'
Gargara quot segetes, quot habet Methymna racemos,
     Aequore quot pisces, fronde teguntur aves,
Quot caelum stellas, tot habet tua Roma puellas:
     Mater in Aeneae constitit urbe sui.                         

While it's allowed, and you can ride hither and yon with loosened reins,
 choose whom you would tell 'Only you please me.'
She won't flow down through gentle breezes to come to you:
 it's OK to spy out a suitable lass with your eyes.
The hunter well knows where to lay his nets for deer,
 he well knows which valley the tooth-gnashing boar waits in;
the shrubbery is known to fowlers; the man who set hooks
 has learned which waters are swum by a great fish:
likewise, you who seek the chance for lasting love,
 first off, learn what place the lass frequents.
I'll not command the seeker to give your sails to the wind,
 nor is it for you to find her by a long and wearying road.
Perseus bore Andromeda away from the black Indus,
 and the Greek maiden was carried off by the Phrygian man,
Rome will give you so many beautiful lasses that you will say,
 'This city has whatever was in the world.'
As many fields that Gargara has, as many bunches of grapes for Methymna,
 as many fish in the sea, and birds in the bush,
as many stars in the sky, your Rome has that many lasses:
 Aeneas' mother stays in her son's city.
