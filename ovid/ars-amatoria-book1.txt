Siquis in hoc artem populo non novit amandi,
     Hoc legat et lecto carmine doctus amet.
Arte citae veloque rates remoque moventur,
     Arte leves currus: arte regendus amor.
Curribus Automedon lentisque erat aptus habenis,               
     Tiphys in Haemonia puppe magister erat:
Me Venus artificem tenero praefecit Amori;
     Tiphys et Automedon dicar Amoris ego.
Ille quidem ferus est et qui mihi saepe repugnet:
     Sed puer est, aetas mollis et apta regi.               
Phillyrides puerum cithara perfecit Achillem,
     Atque animos placida contudit arte feros.
Qui totiens socios, totiens exterruit hostes,
     Creditur annosum pertimuisse senem.
Quas Hector sensurus erat, poscente magistro               
     Verberibus iussas praebuit ille manus.
Aeacidae Chiron, ego sum praeceptor Amoris:
     Saevus uterque puer, natus uterque dea.
Sed tamen et tauri cervix oneratur aratro,
     Frenaque magnanimi dente teruntur equi;               

If anyone in this nation has not learned the art of loving,
 Let him read this poem and, instructed by reading it, love.
Swift boats are skillfully set in motion with sail and oar,
 fleet chariots by skill: love should be managed by skill.
Automedon was well suited for chariots and pliant reins,
 Tiphys was the master in the ship's stern in Thessaly:
Venus put me, an artist, in charge of tender Love:
 I will be called the Tiphys and Automedon of Love.
He is wild indeed, and often would resist me:
 But he's a child, an age that's tender and ought to be controlled.
Chiron polished the boy Achilles with a lyre,
 And subdued his untamed spirit with a gentle art.
He who frightened his companions as often as his foes,
 It's thought that he feared the old man, full of years.
And Hector would feel it, when, as his teacher demanded,
 he held out his hands, commanded for the lash.
Like Chiron to Achilles, I am Love's instructor:
 both boys wild, and the a goddess' child.
But even a bull's neck is burdened by the plow,
 And a bridle's bit is worn away by a noble horse's teeth;


Et mihi cedet Amor, quamvis mea vulneret arcu
Pectora, iactatas excutiatque faces.
Quo me fixit Amor, quo me violentius ussit,
Hoc melior facti vulneris ultor ero:
Non ego, Phoebe, datas a te mihi mentiar artes,
Nec nos aeriae voce monemur avis,
Nec mihi sunt visae Clio Cliusque sorores
Servanti pecudes vallibus, Ascra, tuis:
Usus opus movet hoc: vati parete perito;
Vera canam: coeptis, mater Amoris, ades!
Este procul, vittae tenues, insigne pudoris,
Quaeque tegis medios, instita longa, pedes.
Nos venerem tutam concessaque furta canemus,
Inque meo nullum carmine crimen erit.
Principio, quod amare velis, reperire labora,
Qui nova nunc primum miles in arma venis.
Proximus huic labor est placitam exorare puellam:
Tertius, ut longo tempore duret amor.
Hic modus, haec nostro signabitur area curru:
Haec erit admissa meta terenda rota.

And Love yields to me, however much he might wound my breasts
with his bow, cast out flames of love that were thrown away.
By which Love shaped me, by which he violently burned me,
better than this/him of a wound that was made the avenger I will be:
Not I, Phoebe/Diana, having been given by you to me I would/will lie about the
arts,
and not we to an airy voice of a bird were advised/warned,
and not to me are the sisters Clio and Clius having been seen
by Ascra, watching over your sheep in the valleys:
experience moves this work: obey the expert prophet;
I will sing true words: from/to the undertakings, mother of Love, attend!
Be far off, delicate ribbons, the emblem of shame/honor/modesty,
and which you protect/cover the middle of the feet, with a long dress band/hem.
we sing >a safe/prudent Venus and pardoned/relinquished thefts ,
so tell my poem no reproach it will be.
from the beginning that/because you wish to love, take pains to learn,
and he who new now at first a soldier in arms you come.
Second, to this the work is to win over a pleasant maid:
Third, so that for a long time Love endures.
This way, with our chariout this space will be stamped:
This galloping goal will be rubbed away by the wheel.
