7. A HUMAN SACRIFICE

Tum rēx diem certam dīxit et omnia parāvit. Ubi ea diēs vēnit, 
Andromeda ad lītus dēducta est, et in cōnspectū omnium ad rūpem
alligāta est. Omnēs fatum eius deplōrābant, nec lacrimās tenēbant.
At subitō, dum mōnstrum exspectant, Perseus accurrit; et ubi
lacrimās vīdit, causam dolōris quaerit. Illī rem tōtam expōnunt et 
puellam demōnstrant. Dum haec geruntur, fremitus terribilis
audītur; simul mōnstrum horribilī speciē procul cōnspicitur. Eius
cōnspectus timōrem maximum omnibus iniēcit. Mōnstrum magnā
celeritāte ad lītus contendit, iamque ad locum appropinquābat ubi
puella stābat.

Then the king designated a day and prepared everything.  
When the day came, Andromeda was brought down to the shore, 
and in the sight of all was fettered to a rock.
Everyone mourned her fate, and didn't hold back their tears.
But suddenly, while they're waiting for the monster, Perseus 
rushes up.  And when he sees their tears, he inquires of the 
cause for their sorrow.  They set forth the whole affair to him
and show him the girl.  While these things are going on, a 
dreadful roar is heard.  At the same time a monster of a horrible sort
is spied off in the distance.  The sight of it struck horrible fear into
everyone's hearts. The monster hurled itself straight at the shore,
and was already near to where the girl stood.
