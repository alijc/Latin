8. THE RESCUE

At Perseus ubi haec vīdit, gladium suum ēdūxit, et postquam tālāria
induit, in āēra sublātus est. Tum dēsuper in mōnstrum impetum
subitō fēcit, et gladiō suō collum eius graviter vulnerāvit.
Mōnstrum ubi sēnsit vulnus, fremitum horribilem ēdidit, et sine
morā tōtum corpus in aquam mersit. Perseus dum circum lītus
volat, reditum eius exspectābat. Mare autem intereā undique
sanguine īnficitur. Post breve tempus belua rūrsus caput sustulit;
mox tamen ā Perseō ictū graviōre vulnerāta est. Tum iterum sē in
undās mersit, neque posteā vīsa est.

But when Perseus saw this, he drew his sword, donned the winged sandals,
and was lifted up into the air.  Then he suddenly launched an attack on the 
monster from above, and wounded its neck grievously with his sword.
When the monster felt the blow, it gave out a terrible bellow, and without
delay submerged its entire body into the water.  In the meantime
Perseus flies about the shore, awaiting its return.  But meanwhile
the sea all around turns red with blood.  After a short time the
beast again raised up its head; and was quickly injured by Perseus
with an even graver blow.  Then it sank into the waves a second
time, and was never seen again.
