100. AFLOAT AGAIN

Postrīdiē eius diēī Ulixēs ex hāc insulā quam celerrimē discēdere in
animō habēbat. Circē tamen cum haec cognōvisset, ex odiō ad amōrem
conversa omnibus precibus eum orāre et obtestārī coepit ut paucōs diēs
apud sē morārētur; quā rē tandem impetrātā, tanta beneficia in eum
contulit ut facile eī persuāsum sit ut diūtius manēret. Postquam tamen
tōtum annum apud Circēn cōnsūmpserat, Ulixēs magnō desideriō patriae
suae mōtus est. Sociīs igitur ad sē convocātīs quid in animō habēret
ostendit. Ubi tamen ad lītus descendit, nāvem suam tempestātibus tam
afflictam invēnit ut ad navigandum paene inūtilis esset. Hāc rē cognitā
omnia quae ad nāvēs reficiendās ūsuī essent comparārī iussit, quā in rē
tantam diligentiam omnēs adhibēbant ut ante tertium diem opus
perfēcerint. At Circē ubi omnia ad profectiōnem parāta esse vīdit, rem
aegrē ferēbat et Ulixem vehementer obsecrābat ut eō consiliō desisteret.
Ille tamen, nē annī tempore ā navigātiōne excluderētur, mātūrandum sibi
existimāvit, et tempestātem idōneam nactus nāvem solvit. Multa quidem
perīcula Ulixī subeunda erant antequam in patriam suam pervēnīret, quae
tamen hōc locō longum est perscrībere.

On the following day Ulysses had it in mind to leave that island as quickly
as he could.  But when Circe realized this, she was altered from hate to
love and started to beg and implore him with every request to linger at her
house for a few days.  When, this had finally been obtained, she bestowed
such great kindness on him that she easily persuaded him to remain for a
long time.  But after an entire year had been spent at Circe's house,
Ulysses was stirred with a great longing for his homeland.  And so he
called his companions together and revealed what he had in mind.  But when
he got down to the shore, he found that his ship had been so battered by
storms that it was practically useless for sailing.  When he found this
out, he ordered those with the skill to repair the ship, and everyone
employed such great diligence in the matter that the work was completed
before the third day.  But when Circe saw that everything was ready for
their departure, she could scarcely bear it and vigorously beseeched
Ulysses to give up his resolution. But he, lest he miss the season of year
for sailing, thought that he needed to hurry, and, after finding weather
fit for sailing, launched the ship.  Indeed, Ulysses had to undergo many
dangers before he reached his native land, which are too long to report
here.
