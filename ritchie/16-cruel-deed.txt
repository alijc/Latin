16. A CRUEL DEED

Herculēs iam adulēscēns Thēbīs habitābat. Rēx Thēbārum, vir 1
ignāvus, Creōn appellābātur. Minyae, gēns bellicōsissima,
Thēbānīs fīnitimī erant. Lēgātī autem ā Minyīs ad Thēbānōs
quotannīs mittēbantur; hī Thēbās veniēbant et centum bovēs
postulābant. Thēbānī enim ōlim ā Minyīs superātī erant; tribūta 5
igitur rēgī Minyārum quotannīs pendēbant. At Herculēs cīvēs suōs
hōc stipendiō līberāre cōnstituit; lēgātōs igitur comprehendit, atque
aurēs eōrum abscīdit. Lēgātī autem apud omnēs gentēs sānctī
habentur.

By the time Hercules was a young man he was living in Thebes.
The king of the Thebans, a lazy man, was called Creon. 
The Minyae, a most warlike clan, bordered the Thebans.
Now the Minyae would used to send ambassadors to the Thebans
once a year, these men would come to Thebes and demand 100
head of cattle.  For the Thebans had once been conquered by
the Minyae; and so they used to pay a yearly tribute to the
king of the Minyae.  But Hercules resolved to free his
countrymen from this tax; and so he seized the ambassadors
and cut off their ears.  Now among all nations ambassadors
are held as inviolable.
