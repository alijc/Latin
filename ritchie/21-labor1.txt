21. 1st LABOR: THE NEMEAN LION

Prīmum ab Eurystheō iussus est Herculēs leōnem occīdere quī illō
tempore vallem Nemeaeam reddēbat īnfestam. In silvās igitur in quibus
leō habitābat statim sē contulit. Mox feram vīdit, et arcum, quem sēcum
attulerat, intendit; eius tamen pellem, quae dēnsissima erat, trāicere non
potuit. Tum clāvā magnā quam semper gerēbat leonem percussit, frūstrā
tamen; neque enim hōc modō eum occīdere potuit. Tum dēmum collum
mōnstrī bracchiīs suīs complexus est et faucēs eius omnibus vīribus
compressit. Hōc modō leō brevī tempore exanimatus est; nulla enim
respīrandī facultās eī dabātur. Tum Herculēs cādaver ad oppidum in
umerīs rettulit; et pellem, quam dētrāxerat, posteā prō veste gerēbat.
Omnēs autem quī eam regiōnem incolēbant, ubi fāmam dē morte leōnis
accēpērunt, vehementer gaudēbant et Herculem magnō honōre habēbant.

First off, Hercules was ordered by Eurystheus to kill a lion that was
at the time rendering the vally of Nemea unsafe.  Therefore he immediately
betook himself into the woods in which the lion was living.  He soon saw
the beast, and drew the bow that he had brought with him; yet he could
not pierce the lion's hide, which was very thick.  Then he struck the
lion with the great big club that he always carried, but in vain;
for he couldn't kill it this way either.  Then at last he encircled
the monster's neck with his arms and squeezed its throat with all
his might.  In this way the lion was quickly killed; for it was given
no opportunity for breathing.  Then Hercules carried the corpse back 
to town on his shoulders; and the hide, which he had detached, he
afterwards wore for clothing.  Now everyone who inhabited that region,
when the report of the lion's death was received, rejoiced greatly
and held Hercules in great honor.
