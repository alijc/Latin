47. HERCULES BEARS UP THE HEAVENS

Atlās autem Herculī maximē prōdesse potuit; ille enim cum ipse
esset pater Hesperidum, certō scīvit quō in locō esset hortus.
Postquam igitur audīvit quam ob causam Herculēs vēnisset, "Ipse,"
inquit, "ad hortum ībō et filiābus meīs persuadēbō ut pōma suā
sponte trādant." Herculēs cum haec audīret, magnopere gāvīsus est;
vim enim adhibere nōluit, sī rēs aliter fierī posset. Cōnstituit igitur
oblātum auxilium accipere. Atlās tamen postulāvit ut, dum ipse
abesset, Herculēs caelum umerīs sustinēret. Hoc autem negōtium
Hercules libenter suscēpit, et quamquam rēs erat summī labōris,
totum pondus caelī continuōs complurēs diēs solus sustinēbat.

Now Atlas could be extremely useful to Hercules; for since he
himself was the father of the Hesperides, he knew for sure where
their garden was.  Therefore, after he'd heard why Hercules had
come, he said, "I myself will go to the garden and persuade my
daughters to voluntarily hand over their apples."  When Hercules
heard this, he rejoiced; for he didn't want to use force if the
thing could be otherwise done.  Therefore he decided to accept the
help that was offered.  But Atlas requested that, while he was
away, Hercules would support the sky on his own shoulders.
Hercules willingly accepted this job, and although the matter took
a tremendous effort, he held up the full weight of the sky, alone,
for several days in a row.
