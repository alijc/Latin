50. CHARON'S FERRY

Dē Orcō, quī īdem Hādēs appellābātur, haec trāduntur. Ut quisque
dē vītā dēcesserat, mānēs eius ad Orcum, sēdem mortuōrum, ā deō
Mercurio dēdūcēbantur. Huius regiōnis, quae sub terrā fuisse
dīcitur, rēx erat Plūtō, cui uxor erat Prōserpina, Iovis et Cereris
fīlia. Mānēs igitur ā Mercuriō dēductī prīmum ad rīpam veniēbant
Stygis flūminis, quō rēgnum Plūtōnis continētur. Hoc transīre
necesse erat antequam in Orcum venīre possent. Cum tamen in hōc
flūmine nūllus pōns factus esset, mānēs trānsvēhēbantur ā
Charonte quōdam, quī cum parvā scaphā ad rīpam exspectābat.
Charōn prō hōc officiō mercēdem postulābat, neque quemquam,
nisi hoc praemium prius dedisset, trānsvehere volēbat. Quam ob
causam mōs erat apud antiquōs nūmmum in ore mortuī pōnere eō
cōnsiliō, ut, cum ad Stygem vēnisset, pretium trāiēctus solvere
posset. Eī autem quī post mortem in terrā nōn sepultī erant Stygem
trānsīre nōn potuērunt, sed in rīpā per centum annōs errāre coāctī
sunt; tum dēmum Orcum intrāre licēbat.

About the Underworld, which is also called Hades, these things are
said. Whenever anyone had departed this life, their shades were
led to the Underworld by the god Mercury.  The king of this
region, which is said to be underground, was Pluto, whose wife was
Proserpina, the daughter of Jupiter and Ceres.  And so the shades
that were led by Mercury would first come to the shore of the
River Styx, which surrounded the kingdom of Pluto.  It was needful
to cross this before they could enter the Underground.  But since
no bridge had been built across this river, the shades were
carried across by a certain Charon, who would wait on the shore
with a small boat.  Charon would demand payment for this office,
and was unwilling to transport anyone if he hadn't paid this
price beforehand.  For which reason there was a custom among the
ancients to place a coin in the mouth of the deceased with this
purpose, so that when they came to the Styx, the transportee would
be able to pay the price.  But those who had not been buried in
the earth after death could not cross the Styx, but were compelled
to wander on the shore for a hundred years; then they were at last
permitted to enter the Underworld.
