51. THE REALM OF PLUTO

Ut autem mānēs Stygem hōc modō trānsierant, ad alterum
veniēbant flūmen, quod Lēthē appellābātur. Ex hōc flūmine aquam
bibere cogēbantur; quod cum fēcissent, rēs omnēs in vītā gestās ē
memoriā dēponēbant. Denique ad sedem ipsīus Plūtōnis veniēbant,
cuius introitus ā cane Cerberō custōdiēbatur. Ibi Plūtō nigrō vestītū
indūtus cum uxōre Proserpinā in soliō sēdēbat. Stābant etiam nōn
procul ab eō locō tria alia sōlia, in quibus sēdēbant Mīnōs,
Rhadamanthus, Aeacusque, iūdicēs apud īnferōs. Hī mortuīs iūs
dicēbant et praemia poenāsque cōnstituēbant. Bonī enim in
Campōs Elysiōs, sēdem beātōrum, veniēbant; improbī autem in
Tartarum mittēbantur ac multīs et variīs suppliciīs ibi
excruciābantur.

But when the shades had crossed the Styx in this way, they came to
another river, which was called the Lethe.  They were forced to drink
water from this river; because after they had done so, they would put aside
from their memory everything that they had borne in their lives.
Finally, they came to the abode of Pluto himself, the entrance of
which was guarded by the dog Cereberus.  There Pluto, dressed in a
black garment, sat on his throne with his wife Proserpina.  Three
other thrones also stood not far from that place, on which sat Minos,
Rhadamanthus, and Aeacus, the judges of the dead.  These would pronounce
the law to the dead and ordain their rewards and punishments.  For
the good would go to the Elysian Fields, a habitation of blessings;
but the wicked were sent to Tartarus and were tormented with many
various tortures there.
