53. THE LAST LABOR IS ACCOMPLISHED

Postquam flūmen Stygem hōc modō trānsiit, Herculēs in sēdem ipsīus
Plūtōnis vēnit; et postquam causam veniendī docuit, ab eō petivit ut
Cerberum auferre sibi licēret. Plūtō, quī dē Hercule fāmam acceperat,
eum benignē excēpit, et facultātem quam ille petēbat libenter dedit.
Postulāvit tamen ut Herculēs ipse, cum imperāta Eurystheī fēcisset,
Cerberum in Orcum rūrsus redūceret. Herculēs hoc pollicitus est, et
Cerberum, quem nōn sine magnō periculō manibus prehenderat, summō
cum labōre ex Orcō in lūcem et ad urbem Eurystheī trāxit. Eō cum
vēnisset, tantus timor animum Eurystheī occupāvit ut ex ātriō statim
refūgerit; cum autem paulum sē ex timōre recēpisset, multīs cum lacrimīs
obsecrāvit Herculem ut mōnstrum sine morā in Orcum redūceret. Sīc
contrā omnium opīniōnem duodecim illī labōrēs quōs Pythia praecēperat
intrā duodecim annōs confectī sunt; quae cum ita essent, Herculēs
servitūte tandem liberātus magnō cum gaudiō Thēbās rediit.


After he'd crossed the River Styx in this way, Hercules came to
the abode of Pluto himself; and after informing him of why he had
come, he asked that he might be allowed to carry Cerberus away.
Pluto, who had heard of Hercules' reputation, welcomed him
kindly, and freely gave him the opportunity that he was asking
for.  Nevertheless he asked that, after Hercules had accomplished
the commands of Eurystheus, he would bring Cerberus back to the
Underworld himself.  Hercules promised this, and with an
extraordinary effort dragged Cerberus, who he'd caught with his
own hands, and not without great peril, out of the Underworld and
into the light and to the city of Eurystheus.  After he'd got
there, such a dread seized Eurystheus' heart that he at once
bolted from his atrium; but after he'd recovered a bit from this
terror, he implored Hercules, with many tears, to immediately
return the monster to the Underworld. So against all
expectations, the twelve labors that Pythia had ordered were
completed within twelve years.  And with that being the case,
Hercules, liberated from servitude, returned to Thebes with great
joy.
