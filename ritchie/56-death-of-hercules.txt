56. THE DEATH OF HERCULES

Herculēs nihil malī suspicans vestem quam Lichās attulerat statim
induit; paulō post tamen dolōrem per omnia membra sēnsit, et quae
causa esset eius reī magnopere mirābātur. Dolōre paene
exanimātus, vestem dētrāhere cōnātus est; illa tamen in corpore
haesit, neque ūllō modō abscindī potuit. Tum dēmum Herculēs,
quasi furōre impulsus, in montem Octam sē contulit, et in rogum,
quem summā celeritāte exstruxit, sē impōsuit. Hoc cum fēcisset,
eōs quī circumstābant ōrāvit ut rogum quam celerrimē
succenderent. Omnēs diū recusābant; tandem tamen pāstor quīdam,
ad misericordiam inductus, ignem subdidit. Tum, dum omnia fūmō
obscurantur, Herculēs, dēnsā nūbe velātus ā Iove, in Olympum
abreptus est.

Hercules, suspecting no ill, at once donned the cloak that Lichas
had brought; but a little later pain coursed through all his
limbs, and he wondered greatly what the reason for this was.
Half dead from pain he tried to strip off the cloak, but it clung
to his body, and he couldn't tear it off by any means.  Then
finally Hercules, driven as if by madness, betook himself onto
Mount Octa, and threw himself onto a funeral pyre that he raised
as quickly as he could.  When he had done this, he begged those
who gathered around to quickly set the pyre on fire.  They all
refused for a long time; but in the end a certain shepherd, moved
to pity, applied a flame.  Then, while everything was obscured by
smoke, Hercules was wrapped in a dense cloud and carried away by
Jupiter to Olympus.
