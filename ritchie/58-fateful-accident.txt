58. A FATEFUL ACCIDENT

Post breve tempus Peliās, veritus nē regnum suum tantā vī et
fraude occupātum āmitteret, amīcum quendam Delphōs mīsit, quī
ōrāculum cōnsuleret. Ille igitur quam celerrimē Delphōs sē contulit
et quam ob causam vēnisset demōnstrāvit. Respondit ōrāculum
nūllum esse in praesentiā perīculum; monuit tamen Peliam ut sī
quis ūnum calceum gerens venīret, eum cavēret. Post paucīs annīs
accidit ut Peliās magnum sacrificium factūrus esset; nuntiōs in
omnēs partēs dīmīserat et certam diem conveniendī dīxerat. Diē
constitūtā magnus hominum numerus undique ex agrīs convēnit; in
hīs autem vēnit etiam Iāson, quī ā pueritiā apud centaurum
quendam habitāverat. Dum tamen iter facit, ūnum ē calceīs in
trānseundō nesciō quō flūmine āmīsit.

 Post breve tempus Pelias, veritus ne regnum suum tanta vi et
 fraude occupatum amitteret, amicum quendam Delphos misit, qui
 oraculum consuleret. Ille igitur quam celerrime Delphos se
 contulit et quam ob causam venisset demonstravit. Respondit
 oraculum nullum esse in praesentia periculum; monuit tamen Peliam
 ut si quis unum calceum gerens veniret, eum caveret. Post paucis
 annis accidit ut Pelias magnum sacrificium facturus esset; nuntios
 in omnis partis dimiserat et certam diem conveniendi dixerat. Die
 constituta magnus hominum numerus undique ex agris convenit; in
 his autem venit etiam Iason, qui a pueritia apud centaurum quendam
 habitaverat. Dum tamen iter facit, unum e calceis in transeundo
 nescio quo flumine amisit.

A little while later, Pelias, fearful that he might lose the
kingdom that he had seized through such force and deceit, sent one
of his friends to Delphi to consult the oracle.  And so this friend
betook himself to Delphi as quickly as possible and explained the
reason that he had come.  The oracle replied that there was no
danger at present; however it warned Pelias that if anyone arrived
wearing a single shoe, then he should be wary of him.  After a few
years it came about that Pelias was going to make a great
sacrifice, and had sent messengers out to all directions and had
named a fixed day for people to assemble.  On the appointed day a
great many people assembled from all parts of the country; and
among these was also Jason, who had been living with a certain
centaur.  But when he was making the journey, he lost one of his
shoes while crossing some river.
