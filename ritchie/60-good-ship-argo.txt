60. THE BUILDING OF THE GOOD SHIP ARGO

Cum tamen Colchis multōrum diērum iter ab eō locō abesset, sōlus
Iāsōn proficiscī nōluit. Dīmīsit igitur nuntiōs in omnēs partēs, quī
causam itineris docērent et diem certam conveniendī dīcerent.
Intereā, postquam omnia quae sunt ūsuī ad armandās nāvēs
comportārī iussit, negōtium dedit Argō cuidam, quī summam
scientiam nauticārum rērum habēbat, ut nāvem aedificāret. In hīs
rēbus circiter decem diēs consumptī sunt; Argus enim, quī operī
praeerat, tantam diligentiam adhibēbat ut nē nocturnum quidem
tempus ad labōrem intermitteret. Ad multitūdinem hominum
trānsportandam nāvis paulō erat lātior quam quibus in nostrō marī
ūtī consuēvimus, et ad vim tempestātum perferendam tōta ē rōbore
facta est.

However, since Colchis was a journey of many days away from there,
Jason didn't want to set out alone. And so he sent messengers in
every direction, to explain the reason for the journey and to fix a
day for assembling.  In the meantime, after he'd ordered everything
useful for arming ships to be amassed, he gave a task of building a
ship to a certain Argus, who had the most knowledge of nautical
matters.  About ten days were spent in these matters; for Argus, who
led the work, employed such great industry that not even night
interrupted the effort.  Built for transporting a host of men, the
ship was a little broader than the ones that we are accustomed to
see in our sea, and was built of oak to withstand the force of
storms.
