61. THE ANCHOR IS WEIGHED

Intereā is diēs appetēbat quem Iāsōn per nuntiōs ēdīxerat, et ex
omnibus regiōnibus Graeciae multī, quōs aut reī novitās aut spēs
glōriae movēbat, undique conveniēbant. Trāditum est autem in hōc
numerō fuisse Herculem, de quō suprā multa perscrīpsimus,
Orpheum, citharoedum praeclārissimum, Theseum, Castorem,
multōsque aliōs quōrum nōmina sunt nōtissima. Ex hīs Iāsōn quōs
arbitrātus est ad omnia perīcula subeunda parātissimōs esse, eōs ad
numerum quinquāginta dēlegit et sociōs sibi adiunxit; tum paucōs
diēs commorātus, ut ad omnēs cāsūs subsidia comparāret, nāvem
dēdūxit, et tempestātem ad nāvigandum idōneam nactus magnō
cum plausū omnium solvit.

In the meantime, the day that Jason had proclaimed drew near, and
from every part of Greece many men, stirred by either the novelty of
the affair or by their hope for glory, assembled from every direction.
Now it has been related that among this number was Hercules, of whom
we have already written much, Orpheus, the most famous singer,
Theseus, Castor, and many others whose names are very well known.
Of these Jason observed which were most ready to undergo extreme
danger, selected about 50, and joined forces with them.  Then,
remaining a few more days to set up emergency plans for every
contingency, he launched the ship, and after getting a fair wind
for sailing, set sail with the great applause of every man.
