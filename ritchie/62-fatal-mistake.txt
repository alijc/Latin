62. A FATAL MISTAKE

Haud multō post Argonautae (ita enim appellābantur quī in istā nāvī
vehēbantur) īnsulam quandam, nōmine Cyzicum, attigērunt; et ē nāvī
ēgressī ā rēge illīus regiōnis hospitiō exceptī sunt. Paucās
hōrās ibi commorātī ad sōlis occāsum rursus solvērunt; sed postquam
pauca mīlia passuum progressī sunt, tanta tempestās subitō coörta est ut
cursum tenēre nōn possent, et in eandem partem īnsulae unde nuper
profectī erant magnō cum perīculō dēicerentur. Incolae tamen, cum nox
esset obscūra, Argonautās nōn agnōscēbant, et nāvem inimīcam vēnisse
arbitrātī arma rapuērunt et eōs ēgredī prohibēbant. Ācriter in lītore
pugnātum est, et rēx ipse, quī cum aliīs dēcucurrerat, ab Argonautīs
occīsus est. Mox tamen, cum iam dīlucēsceret, sēnsērunt incolae sē errāre
et arma abiēcērunt; Argonautae autem cum rēgem occīsum esse vīdērent,
magnum dolōrem percēpērunt.

 Haud multo post Argonautae (ita enim appellabantur qui in ista navi
 vehebantur) insulam quandam, nomine Cyzicum, attigerunt; et e navi
 egressi a rege illius regionis hospitio excepti sunt. Paucas horas ibi
 commorati ad solis occasum rursus solverunt; sed postquam pauca milia
 passuum progressi sunt, tanta tempestas subito coorta est ut cursum
 tenere non possent, et in eandem partem insulae unde nuper profecti
 erant magno cum periculo deicerentur. Incolae tamen, cum nox esset
 obscura, Argonautas non agnoscebant, et navem inimicam venisse arbitrati
 arma rapuerunt et eos egredi prohibebant. Acriter in litore pugnatum
 est, et rex ipse, qui cum aliis decucurrerat, ab Argonautis occisus
 est. Mox tamen, cum iam dilucesceret, senserunt incolae se errare et
 arma abiecerunt; Argonautae autem cum regem occisum esse viderent,
 magnum dolorem perceperunt.

Not much later the Argonauts (for this was what the men who sailed in
that ship were called) reached the island of Cyzicus; and after they had
disembarked they were welcomed and entertained by the king of that
region.  They lingered there for a few hours and then set sail again at
sunset; but after they had gone a few miles, such a great storm suddenly
rose up that they could not hold to their course, and they were driven,
with great peril, onto the same part of the island that they had just
left. But the inhabitants didn't recognize the Argonauts, because the
night was dark, and, having decided that an enemy ship had arrived,
snatched up their weapons to keep them from disembarking.  They fought
fiercely on the shore, and the king himself ran down to the shore with
the others, and was cut down by the Argonauts.  But soon, when it grew
light, the inhabitants realized that they'd made a mistake and threw
their weapons aside; but when the Argonauts saw that the king had been
killed, they fell into a deep grief.
