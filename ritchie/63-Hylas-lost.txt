63. THE LOSS OF HYLAS

Postrīdiē eius diēī Iāsōn tempestātem satis idōneam esse arbitrātus
(summa enim tranquillitās iam cōnsecūta erat), ancorās sustulit, et
pauca mīlia passuum progressus ante noctem Mysiam attigit. Ibi
paucās hōrās in ancorīs exspectāvit; ā nautīs enim cognōverat
aquae cōpiam quam sēcum habērent iam dēficere, quam ob causam
quīdam ex Argonautīs in terram ēgressī aquam quaerēbant. Hōrum
in numerō erat Hylās quīdam, puer formā praestantissimā. Quī dum
fontem quaerit, ā comitibus paulum sēcesserat. Nymphae autem
quae fontem colēbant, cum iuvenem vīdissent, eī persuādēre
cōnātae sunt ut sēcum manēret; et cum ille negāret sē hoc factūrum
esse, puerum vī abstulērunt.

 Postridie eius diei Iason tempestatem satis idoneam esse
 arbitratus (summa enim tranquillitas iam consecuta erat), ancoras
 sustulit, et pauca milia passuum progressus ante noctem Mysiam
 attigit. Ibi paucas horas in ancoris exspectavit; a nautis enim
 cognoverat aquae copiam quam secum haberent iam deficere, quam ob
 causam quidam ex Argonautis in terram egressi aquam
 quaerebant. Horum in numero erat Hylas quidam, puer forma
 praestantissima. Qui dum fontem quaerit, a comitibus paulum
 secesserat. Nymphae autem quae fontem colebant, cum iuvenem
 vidissent, ei persuadere conatae sunt ut secum maneret; et cum
 ille negaret se hoc facturum esse, puerum vi abstulerunt.

 Comites eius postquam Hylam amissum esse senserunt, magno dolore
 adfecti diu frustra quaerebant. Hercules autem et Polyphemus, qui
 vestigia pueri longius secuti erant, ubi tandem ad litus
 redierunt, Iasonem solvisse cognoverunt.

The next day, when Jason judged that the weather was fair enough
(for a great calm had followed the storm), he raised the anchors
and sailed a few miles further on, reaching Mysia before
nightfall. There he anchored and waited a few hours, for he had
learned from the sailors that they were running short of water,
and for that reason some of the Argonauts had disembarked to look
for it.  Among these was a certain Hylas, a boy of extraordinary
beauty.  While seeking out a spring, he drew off a bit from his
companions. But when the nymphs who worshiped the spring saw the
youth, they tried to persuade him to stay with them; and when he
refused to do so, they carried the boy off by force.

After his companions realized that Hylas was missing, they were
struck with a great sorrow and searched for him at length, but to
no avail. But when Hercules and Polyphemus, who had followed the
boy's tracks for longer than anyone else, finally returned to the
shore, they found that Jason had set sail.
