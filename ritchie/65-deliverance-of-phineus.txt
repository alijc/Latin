65. THE DELIVERANCE OF PHINEUS

Rēs igitur male sē habēbat cum Argonautae nāvem appulērunt. Phīneus
autem simul atque audīvit eōs in suōs fīnēs ēgressōs esse, magnopere
gāvisus est. Sciēbat enim quantam opīniōnem virtūtis Argonautae
habērent, nec dubitābat quīn sibi auxilium ferrent. Nūntium igitur ad
nāvem mīsit, quī Iāsonem sociōsque ad rēgiam vocāret. Eō cum
vēnissent, Phīneus demōnstrāvit quantō in perīculō suae rēs essent, et
prōmīsit sē magna praemia datūrum esse, sī illī remedium repperissent.
Argonautae negōtium libenter suscēpērunt, et ubi hōra vēnit, cum rēge
accubuērunt; at simul ac cēna apposita est, Harpyiae cenāculum
intrāvērunt et cibum auferre cōnābantur. Argonautae prīmum gladiīs
volucrēs petiērunt; cum tamen vidērent hoc nihil prōdesse, Zētēs et
Calais, quī alīs erant instructī, in āëra sē sublevāvērunt, ut dēsuper
impetum facerent. Quod cum sēnsissent Harpyiae, reī novitāte perterritae
statim aufūgērunt, neque posteā umquam rediērunt.

And so things were going badly when the Argonauts put ashore.  But
as soon as Phineus heard that they had landed in his country he was
overjoyed. For he knew how great a reputation of the strength that
the Argonauts had, and had no doubts that they would be able to render
him aid.  And so he sent a messenger to the ship, to summon Jason and
his companions to court.  When they had come, Phineus showed them how
great was the danger that matters stood in, and promised to bestow a
vast reward on them if they could figure out a remedy.  The Argonauts
gladly undertook the task, and when the hour arrived, sat down to eat
with the king.  But as soon as the dinner was served, The Harpies
entered the dining hall and attempted to carry off the food.  The
Argonauts attacked the birds with their swords first; but when they saw
that didn't do anything, Zetes and Calais, who were equipped with wings,
launched themselves into the air to attack from above.  When the Harpies
realized this, they fled at once, terrified by this strange thing, and
never again returned.
