66. THE SYMPLEGADES

Hōc factō Phīneus, ut prō tantō beneficiō meritam grātiam referret, Iāsonī
demōnstrāvit quā ratiōne Symplēgadēs vitāre posset. Symplēgadēs autem
duae erant rūpēs ingentī magnitūdine, quae ā Iove positae erant eō
cōnsiliō, nē quis ad Colchida pervenīret. Hae parvō intervallō in marī
natābant, et sī quid in medium spatium vēnerat, incredibilī celeritāte
concurrēbant. Postquam igitur ā Phineō doctus est quid faciendum esset,
Iāsōn sublātīs ancorīs nāvem solvit, et lēnī ventō provectus mox ad
Symplēgadēs appropinquāvit. Tum in prorā stāns columbam quam in
manū tenēbat ēmīsit. Illa recta via per medium spatium volavit, et
priusquam rūpēs cōnflīxērunt, incolumis ēvāsit caudā tantum āmissā.
Tum rūpēs utrimque discessērunt; antequam tamen rursus concurrerent,
Argonautae, bene intellegentēs, omnem spem salūtis in celeritāte positam
esse, summā vī rēmīs contendērunt et nāvem incolumem perdūxērunt.
Hōc factō dīs grātiās maximās ēgerunt, quōrum auxiliō ē tantō perīculō
ereptī essent; omnēs enim sciēbant nōn sine auxiliō deōrum rem tam
fēlīciter ēvēnisse.

After this was done Phineus, in order to show the gratitude deserved
for such a great kindness, revealed to Jason a plan by which he might
evade the Symplegades.  Now the two Symplegades were rocks of an
enormous size, which had been placed by Jupiter so that no one could
reach Colchis.  They floated in the sea a little way apart, and if
anything came in between them, they crashed together with incredible
speed.  And so, after Phineus had shown him what had to be done, Jason
weighed anchor and, wafted by a gentle wind, soon drew near to the
Symplegades. Then, standing in the prow, he let go a dove that he was
holding in his hand.  It flew straight down the middle, and before
the rocks collided, it escaped alive, losing only its tail.  Then the
rocks both sprang back; but before they could crash together again, the
Argonauts, well understanding that all their hope of safety lay in
speed, bent the oars with all their might and brought the ship through
unscathed.  After accomplishing this they gave loud thanks to the gods,
by whose help they had been rescued from such peril; for everyone knew
that the business would not have come out so well without the gods'
help.
