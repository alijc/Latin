68. THE MAGIC OINTMENT

Medea, regis fīlia, Iāsonem adamāvit, et ubi audīvit eum tantum
perīculum subitūrum esse, rem aegrē ferēbat. Intellegēbat enim patrem
suum hunc labōrem propōsuisse eō ipsō consiliō, ut Iāsōn morerētur.
Quae cum ita essent, Medea, quae summam scientiam medicīnae habēbat,
hoc cōnsilium iniit. Mediā nocte, insciente pātre, ex urbe ēvāsit, et
postquam in montēs fīnitimōs vēnit, herbās quāsdam carpsit; tum sūcō
expressō unguentum parāvit quod vī suā corpus aleret nervōsque
confirmāret. Hōc factō Iāsonī unguentum dedit; praecēpit autem ut eō diē
quō istī labōrēs conficiendī essent corpus suum et arma mānē oblineret.
Iason etsī paene omnibus hominibus magnitūdine et vīribus corporis
antecellēbat (vīta enim omnis in venātiōnibus atque in studiō reī militāris
cōnsumēbatur), tamen hoc cōnsilium nōn neglegendum esse censēbat.

Medea, the king's daughter fell in love with Jason and bore it ill when
she heard that he was about to be placed in such peril.  For she
understood that her father had proposed this labor in order for Jason to
die.  As a result, Medea, who had the utmost knowledge of medicine,
undertook this plan.  In the middle of the night, without her father's
knowledge, she slipped out of the city, and after going to the nearby
mountains, picked certain herbs.  Then she squeezed out the sap and
prepared an ointment that by its own power would nourish the body and
support the sinews.  When she'd finished this she gave the ointment to
Jason; and she warned him that he should smear it on his body and weapons
on the morning that those labors were to be done.  Even though Jason excelled
nearly every other man in the size and strength of his body (for his whole
life was spent in the chase and in military affairs), nonetheless he
reckoned that this advice should not be ignored.
