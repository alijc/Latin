69. THE SOWING OF THE DRAGON'S TEETH

Ubi is diēs vēnit quem rēx ad arandum agrum ēdīxerat, Iāsōn ortā
lūce cum sociīs ad locum constitūtum sē contulit. Ibi stabulum
ingēns repperit, in quō taurī erant inclusī; tum portīs apertīs taurōs
in lūcem trāxit, et summā cum difficultāte iugum impōsuit. At
Aeëtes cum vidēret taurōs nihil contrā Iāsonem valēre, magnopere
mirātus est; nesciēbat enim fīliam suam auxilium eī dedisse. Tum
Iāsōn omnibus aspicientibus agrum arāre coepit, quā in rē tantam
diligentiam praebuit ut ante meridiem tōtum opus confēcerit. Hōc
factō ad locum ubi rēx sēdēbat adiit et dentēs dracōnis postulāvit;
quō ubi accēpit, in agrum quem arāverat magnā cum dīligentiā 
sparsit. Hōrum autem dentium natūra erat tālis ut in eō locō ubi
sēmentēs factae essent virī armātī mīrō quōdam modō gīgnerentur.

 Ubi is dies venit quem rex ad arandum agrum edixerat, Iason orta luce
 cum sociis ad locum constitutum se contulit. Ibi stabulum ingens
 repperit, in quo tauri erant inclusi; tum portis apertis tauros in
 lucem traxit, et summa cum difficultate iugum imposuit. At Aeetes cum
 videret tauros nihil contra Iasonem valere, magnopere miratus est;
 nesciebat enim filiam suam auxilium ei dedisse. Tum Iason omnibus
 aspicientibus agrum arare coepit, qua in re tantam diligentiam
 praebuit ut ante meridiem totum opus confecerit. Hoc facto ad locum
 ubi rex sedebat adiit et dentis draconis postulavit; quos ubi
 accepit, in agrum quem araverat magna cum diligentia sparsit. Horum
 autem dentium natura erat talis ut in eo loco ubi sementes factae
 essent viri armati miro quodam modo gignerentur.

At daybreak on the day that the king had proclaimed for plowing the
field, Jason and his companions gathered at the appointed place. There
he discovered a huge stable that the bulls were shut up in.  Then he
opened the doors and dragged the bulls into the light, and with the
utmost difficulty put on the yoke.  But when Aeetes saw that the bulls
could not prevail against Jason, he marvelled very much; for he did
not know that his daughter had offered him aid.  Then Jason began to
plow the field, with everyone looking on, in which matter he showed so
much industry that the whole job was completed before noon.  When this
was done he approached the spot where the king was sitting and
demanded the dragon's teeth; when he got them, he scattered them onto
the field that he had plowed with great industry.  Now the nature of
these teeth was such that wherever they were planted armed men would
spring forth in some miraculous way.
