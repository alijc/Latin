70. A STRANGE CROP

Nōndum tamen Iāsōn tōtum opus confēcerat; imperāverat enim eī
Aeëtes ut armātōs virōs quī ē dentibus gīgnerentur sōlus
interficeret. Postquam igitur omnēs dentēs in agrum sparsit, Iāsōn
lassitudine exanimātus quietī sē trādidit, dum virī istī gīgnerentur.
Paucās horās dormiēbat, sub vesperum tamen ē somnō subitō
excitātus rem ita ēvēnisse ut praedictum esset cognōvit; nam in
omnibus agrī partibus virī ingentī magnitūdine corporis gladiīs
galeīsque armātī mīrum in modum ē terrā oriēbantur. Hōc cognitō
Iāsōn cōnsilium quod dedisset Medea nōn ōmittendum esse
putābat. Saxum igitur ingēns (ita enim Medea praecēperat) in
mediōs virōs coniēcit. Illī undique ad locum concurrērunt, et cum
quisque sibi id saxum habēre vellet, magna contrōversia orta est.
Mox strictīs gladiīs inter sē pugnāre coepērunt, et cum hōc modō
plurimī occīsī essent, reliquī vulneribus confectī ā Iāsone nūllō
negōtiō interfectī sunt.

But Jason hadn't yet completed the whole job; for Aeetes had
commanded him to, by himself, kill the armed men who were brought
forth from the teeth.  And so, after all the teeth had been
strewn onto the field, Jason, faint with weariness, gave himself
to rest while those men sprang up.  He slept for a few hours, but
when he was suddenly roused from his sleep towards evening, he
found that the matter had turned out as had been predicted; for
in all parts of the field men of an enormous size, armed with
swords and helmets, were emerging out of the earth in a marvelous
manner.  When he perceived this Jason reflected that the plan that
Medea had given him should not be disregarded.  And so he cast a
huge rock (for Medea had so instructed) into the middle of the
men.  They hastened to the spot from every side, and since each
one wanted, I know not why, to have this rock, a great argument
sprang up.  Soon they began to fight among themselves with drawn
swords, and when most of them had been killed in this way, the
rest, reduced by their wounds, were killed by Jason with no
effort.
