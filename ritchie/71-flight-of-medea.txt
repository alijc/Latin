71. THE FLIGHT OF MEDEA

Rēx Aeëtēs ubi Iāsonem labōrem prōpositum confēcisse cognōvit, īrā
graviter commōtus est; id enim per dolum factum esse intellegēbat; nec
dubitābat quīn Medea eī auxilium tulisset. Medea autem cum intellegeret
sē in magnō fore perīculō sī in rēgiā manēret, fuga salūtem petere
constituit. Omnibus rēbus igitur ad fugam parātīs mediā nocte,
insciente pātre, cum frātre Absyrtō ēvāsit, et quam celerrimē ad locum
ubi Argō subducta erat sē contulit. Eō cum vēnisset, ad pedēs Iāsonis
sē proiēcit, et multīs cum lacrimīs eum obsecrāvit nē in tantō
discrīmine mulierem dēsereret quae eī tantum prōfuisset. Ille quod
memoriā tenēbat sē per eius auxilium ē magnō periculō ēvāsisse,
libenter eam excēpit, et postquam causam veniendī audīvit, hortātus est
nē patris īram timēret. Prōmīsit autem sē quam prīmum eam in nāvī suā
āvectūrum.

 Rex Aeetes ubi Iasonem laborem propositum confecisse cognovit, ira
 graviter commotus est; id enim per dolum factum esse intellegebat; nec
 dubitabat quin Medea ei auxilium tulisset. Medea autem cum
 intellegeret se in magno fore periculo si in regia maneret, fuga
 salutem petere constituit. Omnibus rebus igitur ad fugam paratis media
 nocte insciente patre cum fratre Absyrto evasit, et quam celerrime ad
 locum ubi Argo subducta erat se contulit. Eo cum venisset, ad pedes
 Iasonis se proiecit, et multis cum lacrimis eum obsecravit ne in tanto
 discrimine mulierem desereret quae ei tantum profuisset. Ille quod
 memoria tenebat se per eius auxilium e magno periculo evasisse,
 libenter eam excepit, et postquam causam veniendi audivit, hortatus
 est ne patris iram timeret. Promisit autem se quam primum eam in navi
 sua avecturum.

When King Aeetes found out that Jason had brought off the job that he
had proposed, he was seized with a violent rage; for he realized that
it had been done by means of trickery; and had no doubt that Medea had
borne him aid.  But Medea, when she realized that she would be in great
peril if she remained in the kingdom, decided to make for safety
through flight.  And so, when she had readied everything for her
flight, she escaped in the middle of the night with her brother
Absyrtus, unbeknownst to her father, and betook herself, as fast as she
could go, to the place where the Argo had been hauled up.  When she
made it there, she threw herself to the feet of Jason, and with many
tears beseeched him to not leave a woman who had been so useful to him
when she was in such a fix.  Because he remembered that he had avoided
a great danger because of her help, he gladly welcomed her, and after
hearing why she had come, encouraged her to have no fear for her
father's anger.  But he promised to carry her away in his ship as soon
as he could.
