73. THE RETURN TO THE ARGO

Dum autem ea geruntur, Argonautae, quī ad mare relictī erant, anxiō
animō reditum Iāsonis exspectābant; id enim negōtium summī esse
periculī intellegēbant. Postquam igitur ad occāsum sōlis frustrā
exspectāverunt, de eius salūte dēspērāre coeperunt, nec dubitābant quīn
aliquī cāsus accidisset. Quae cum ita essent, mātūrandum sibi censuērunt,
ut ducī auxilium ferrent; sed dum proficiscī parant, lūmen quoddam
subitō conspiciunt mīrum in modum intrā silvās refulgēns, et magnopere
mīrātī quae causa esset eius reī ad locum concurrunt. Quō cum vēnissent,
Iāsonī et Mēdēae advenientibus occurrērunt, et vellus aureum lūminis
eius causam esse cognōvērunt. Omnī timōre sublātō magnō cum gaudiō
ducem suum excēpērunt, et dīs grātiās maximās ēgērunt quod rēs tam
feliciter ēvēnisset.

 Dum autem ea geruntur, Argonautae, qui ad mare relicti erant, anxio
 animo reditum Iasonis exspectabant; id enim negotium summi esse
 periculi intellegebant. Postquam igitur ad occasum solis frustra
 exspectaverunt, de eius salute desperare coeperunt, nec dubitabant quin
 aliqui casus accidisset. Quae cum ita essent, maturandum sibi
 censuerunt, ut duci auxilium ferrent; sed dum proficisci parant, lumen
 quoddam subito conspiciunt mirum in modum intra silvas refulgens, et
 magnopere mirati quae causa esset eius rei ad locum concurrunt. Quo cum
 venissent, Iasoni et Medeae advenientibus occurrerunt, et vellus aureum
 luminis eius causam esse cognoverunt. Omni timore sublato magno cum
 gaudio ducem suum exceperunt, et dis gratias maximas egerunt quod res
 tam feliciter evenisset.

But while these things were being carried out, the Argonauts, who had
been left on the shore, awaited the return of Jason with anxious hearts;
for they realized that this task was one of the greatest peril.  And so,
after they waited until sundown to no purpose, they began to despair of
his safety, and had no doubt that some misfortune had befallen him.   
As a result, they reckoned that they needed to make haste and bear aid
to their leader; but while they were getting ready to set out, they
observed some light shining among the trees in an extraordinary manner,
and marvelling at what caused this this thing, come running up to the
spot. When they got there, they met with Jason and Medea, coming towards
them, and learned that the golden fleece was the cause of the light.
With their fear gone, everyone received their leader with great
rejoicing, and gave loud thanks to the gods that the matter had come out
so happily.
