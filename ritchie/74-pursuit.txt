74. THE PURSUIT

Hīs rēbus gestīs omnēs sine morā nāvem rūrsus conscenderunt, et
sublātīs ancorīs prīmā vigiliā solvērunt; neque enim satis tūtum
esse arbitrātī sunt in eō locō manēre. At rēx Aeëtēs, quī iam ante
inimīcō in eōs fuerat animō, ubi cognōvit fīliam suam nōn modō ad
Argonautās sē rēcēpisse sed etiam ad vellus auferendum auxilium
tulisse, hōc dolōre gravius exārsit. Nāvem longam quam celerrimē
dēdūcī iussit, et mīlitibus impositīs fugientēs insecūtus est.
Argonautae, quī rem in discrīmine esse bene sciēbant, omnibus
vīribus rēmīs contendēbant; cum tamen nāvis quā vehēbantur
ingentī esset magnitūdine, nōn eādem celeritāte quā Colchī
prōgredī poterant. Quō factum est ut minimum abesset quīn ā
Colchīs sequentibus caperentur, neque enim longius intererat quam
quō tēlum adicī posset. At Mēdēa cum vīdisset quō in locō rēs
essent, paene omnī spē dēpositā, infandum hoc cōnsilium cēpit.


 His rebus gestis omnes sine mora navem rursus conscenderunt, et
 sublatis ancoris prima vigilia solverunt; neque enim satis tutum
 esse arbitrati sunt in eo loco manere. At rex Aeetes, qui iam
 ante inimico in eos fuerat animo, ubi cognovit filiam suam non
 modo ad Argonautas se recepisse sed etiam ad vellus auferendum
 auxilium tulisse, hoc dolore gravius exarsit. Navem longam quam
 celerrime deduci iussit, et militibus impositis fugientis
 insecutus est. Argonautae, qui rem in discrimine esse bene
 sciebant, omnibus viribus remis contendebant; cum tamen navis
 qua vehebantur ingenti esset magnitudine, non eadem celeritate
 qua Colchi progredi poterant. Quo factum est ut minimum abesset
 quin a Colchis sequentibus caperentur, neque enim longius
 intererat quam quo telum adici posset. At Medea cum vidisset quo
 in loco res essent, paene omni spe deposita infandum hoc
 consilium cepit.

After these things had been carried out, everyone climbed back
into the ship without delay, and after weighing anchor they set
sail at first light; for they judged that remaining in that place
was not sufficiently safe.  But King Aeetes was already in a
hostile mind against them, and when he learned that his own
daughter had not only taken herself to the Argonauts but had also
aided in carrying off the fleece, he raged more strongly due to
this anguish. He commanded that a long boat be launched as
quickly as possible, and, after putting soldiers on board,
pursued the fugitives.  The Argonauts, who well knew that a
crisis had come, bent to the oars with all their might; but since
the ship in which they were borne was of a great size, they could
not advance with the same speed as the Colchians.  Due to that
they came close to being captured by the pursuing Colchians, for
the distance between them was less than that which a man can hurl
a spear.  But when Medea saw how things lay, she lost all hope
and seized on an unspeakable plan.
