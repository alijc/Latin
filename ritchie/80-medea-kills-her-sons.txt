80. MEDEA KILLS HER SONS

Vix vestem induerat Glaucē cum dolōrem gravem per omnia membra
sēnsit, et paulō post crūdēlī cruciātū affecta ē vītā excessit. Hīs rēbus
gestīs Mēdēa furōre atque āmentiā impulsa fīliōs suōs necāvit; tum
magnum sibi fore perīculum arbitrāta sī in Thessaliā manēret, ex eā
regiōne fugere cōnstituit. Hōc cōnstitutō Sōlem orāvit ut in tantō perīculō
auxilium sibi praebēret. Sōl autem hīs precibus commōtus currum mīsit
cui erant iunctī dracōnēs alīs instructī. Mēdēa nōn omittendam tantam
occāsiōnem arbitrāta currum ascendit, itaque per āëra vecta incolumis ad
urbem Athēnās pervēnit. Iāsōn ipse brevī tempore mīrō modō occīsus est.
Accidit sīve cāsū sīve cōnsiliō deōrum ut sub umbrā nāvis suae, quae in
lītus subducta erat, dormīret. Mox nāvis, quae adhuc ērēcta steterat, in
eam partem ubi Iāsōn iacēbat subitō dēlāpsa virum īnfēlīcem oppressit.

Glauce had scarcely put the garment on before she felt a fierce pain
through all her limbs, and a little later, afflicted with merciless pain,
passed out of life.  After Medea had carried out these events, driven by
fury and madness, she murdered her own sons; then, deciding that she
would be in grave danger if she remained in Thessaly, resolved to
flee the country. Having so resolved, she entreated the sun to provide her
aid in such great danger.  Now the sun, moved by this prayer, sent a
chariot to which were yoked winged dragons.  Medea, deciding that such a
chance should not be ignored, mounted the chariot, and so, borne through
the air, came safely to the city of Athens.  Jason himself was killed soon after
in a remarkable way. It happened, either by chance or by the gods' will,
that he fell asleep in the shade of his ship, which had been drawn up onto
the shore.  Then the ship, which had stood upright up to then, suddenly
fell onto the side where Jason was sleeping, crushing the unhappy man.
