81. HOMEWARD BOUND

Urbem Troiam ā Graecīs decem annōs obsessam esse satis cōnstat; dē
hōc enim bellō Homerus, maximus poētārum Graecōrum, Iliadem, opus
nōtissimum, scrīpsit. Troiā tandem per īnsidiās captā, Graecī longō bellō
fessī domum redīre mātūrāvērunt. Omnibus rēbus igitur ad profectiōnem
parātīs, nāvēs dēdūxērunt, et tempestātem idōneam nactī magnō cum
gaudiō solvērunt. Erat inter primōs Graecōrum Ulixēs quīdam, vir
summae virtūtis ac prudentiae, quem dicunt nōnnullī dolum istum
excōgitāsse quō Troiam captam esse cōnstat. Hic rēgnum īnsulae Ithacae
obtinuerat, et paulō antequam cum reliquīs Graecīs ad bellum profectus
est, puellam formōsissimam, nōmine Pēnelopēn, in mātrimōnium
dūxerat. Nunc igitur cum iam decem annōs quasi in exsiliō
consumpsisset, magnā cupiditāte patriae et uxōris videndae ārdēbat.

It is well-known that the city of Troy was besieged by the Greeks for 
ten years; indeed Homer, the greatest of the Greek poets, wrote his 
masterpiece, the Illiad, about this war.  When Troy was finally
captured by means of a subterfuge, the Greeks, wearied by the long
war, hastened to return home.  And so, after readying their ships in
every way for departure, they launched them, and, meeting with a fair
wind, set sail with great joy.  There was among the foremost of the
Greeks a certain Ulysses, a man of great virtue and wisdom, who
some say devised the trick through which Troy was captured, as
everyone knows.  He held the kingdom of the island of Ithica, and a
little before he had set out to war along with the rest of the Greeks,
he had married a most beautiful lass, named Penelope.  And so now,
since ten years had been wasted in what seemed like exile, he burned
with a great desire to see his native land and his wife.
