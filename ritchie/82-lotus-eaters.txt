82. THE LOTUS-EATERS

Postquam tamen pauca milia passuum ā litōre Troiae progressī sunt, tanta
tempestās subitō coörta est ut nūlla nāvium cursum tenēre posset, sed
aliae aliās in partēs disicerentur. Nāvis autem, quā ipse Ulixēs vehēbātur,
vī tempestātis ad meridiem dēlāta decimō diē ad lītus Libyae appulsa est.
Ancorīs iactīs, Ulixēs cōnstituit nōnnullōs ē sociīs in terram expōnere, quī
aquam ad nāvem referrent et quālis esset natūra eius regiōnis
cognōscerent. Hī igitur ē nāvī ēgressī imperāta facere parābant. Dum
tamen fontem quaerunt, quibusdam ex incolīs obviam factī ab eīs hospitiō
acceptī sunt. Accidit autem ut maior pars victus eōrum hominum in mīrō
quōdam fructū quem ‘lōtum’ appellābant consisteret. Quam cum Graecī
gustāssent, patriae et sociōrum statim oblītī confirmāvērunt sē semper in
eā terrā mansūrōs, ut dulcī illō cibō in perpetuum vēscerentur.

But after they had advanced a few miles from the shores of Troy, such a
great storm suddenly rose up that no ship could hold to its course, but
they were all scattered far and wide.  And the ship on which Ulysses
himself sailed was carried by the force of the storm and driven south
to the shore of Libya ten days later. After dropping anchor Ulysses
decided to land a few of his companions, so that they could bring water
back to the ship and learn the nature of that region.  And so these men
disembarked and prepared to follow these orders.  But while they
searched for a spring, they ran into some of the inhabitants and were
received with hospitality.  Now it happened that the greater part of
the sustenance of these people consisted of a certain remarkable fruit
that they called the lotus.  After the Greeks had tasted this, they
straightway forgot their fatherland and companions and declared that
they would abide forever in that land, in order to eat that sweet food
for eternity.
