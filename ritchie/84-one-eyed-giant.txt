84. THE ONE-EYED GIANT

Postquam eā tōtā nocte rēmīs contendērunt, postrīdiē ad terram
ignōtam nāvem appulērunt. Tum, quod natūram eius regiōnis
ignorābat, ipse Ulixēs cum duodecim ē sociīs in terram ēgressus
loca explōrāre cōnstituit. Paulum ā lītore progressī ad spēluncam
ingentem pervēnērunt, quam habitārī sēnsērunt; eius enim
introitum et natūrā locī et manū munītum esse animadvertērunt.
Mox, etsī intellegēbant sē nōn sine perīculō id factūrōs, spēluncam
intrāvērunt; quod cum fēcissent, magnam cōpiam lactis in vāsīs
ingentibus condītam invēnērunt. Dum tamen mīrantur quis in eā
sēde habitāret, sonitum terribilem audīvērunt, et oculīs ad portam
tortīs mōnstrum horribile vīdērunt, hūmānā quidem speciē et
figūrā, sed ingentī magnitūdine corporis. Cum autem
animadvertissent mōnstrum ūnum oculum tantum habēre in mediā
fronte positum, intellexērunt hunc esse ūnum ē Cyclōpibus, dē
quibus fāmam iam accēperant.

 Postquam ea tota nocte remis contenderunt, postridie ad terram
 ignotam navem appulerunt. Tum, quod naturam eius regionis
 ignorabat, ipse Ulixes cum duodecim e sociis in terram egressus
 loca explorare constituit. Paulum a litore progressi ad speluncam
 ingentem pervenerunt, quam habitari senserunt; eius enim
 introitum et natura loci et manu munitum esse
 animadverterunt. Mox, etsi intellegebant se non sine periculo id
 facturos, speluncam intraverunt; quod cum fecissent, magnam
 copiam lactis in vasis ingentibus conditam invenerunt. Dum tamen
 mirantur quis in ea sede habitaret, sonitum terribilem
 audiverunt, et oculis ad portam tortis monstrum horribile
 viderunt, humana quidem specie et figura, sed ingenti magnitudine
 corporis. Cum autem animadvertissent monstrum unum oculum tantum
 habere in media fronte positum, intellexerunt hunc esse unum e
 Cyclopibus, de quibus famam iam acceperant.

After they had bent to the oars the whole night, they put ashore
the next day in an unknown land.  Then, since he didn't know the
nature of the region, Ulysses himself disembarked with twelve of
his companions, resolved to explore the place.  After they'd
advanced a little ways from the shore they came upon an enormous
cave, that they saw was inhabited; for they noticed that its
entrance had been fortified by both nature and by hand.  Then,
even though they realized that it would not be without danger,
they entered the cave; when they had done so, they found a great
deal of milk stored in enormous vessels.  But while they wondered
who might live in this abode, they heard a frightful noise, and,
turning their eyes to the entrance, saw a terrifying monster,
certainly human in form and shape, but of an immense size.  But
when they had observed that the monster had only a single eye
placed in the middle of his forehead, they realized that this was
one of the Cyclops, whose reputation they had already heard about.
