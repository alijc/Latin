89. THE BLINDING OF POLYPHEMUS

Hāc oratiōne habitā, postquam extrēmum palum ignī calefēcit, oculum
Polyphemī dormientis ferventī lignō perfōdit; quō factō omnēs in
diversās spēluncae partēs sē abdidērunt. At ille subitō illō dolōre oculī ē
somnō excitātus clāmōrem terribilem sustulit, et dum per spēluncam
errat, Ulixem manū prehendere cōnābātur; cum tamen iam omnīnō caecus
esset, nūllō modō hoc efficere potuit. Intereā reliquī Cyclōpēs, clāmōre
audītō, undique ad spēluncam convēnērunt, et ad introitum adstantēs quid
Polyphēmus ageret quaesīverunt, et quam ob causam tantum clāmōrem
sustulisset. Ille respondit sē graviter vulnerātum esse et magnō dolōre
adficī. Cum tamen posteā quaesīvissent quis ei vim intulisset, respondit
ille Neminem id fēcisse; quibus rēbus auditīs ūnus ē Cyclōpibus: “At sī
nēmō,” inquit, “tē vulnerāvit, haud dubium est quīn cōnsiliō deōrum,
quibus resistere nec possumus nec volumus, hōc suppliciō adficiāris.”
Hoc cum dīxisset, abiērunt Cyclōpēs eum in insāniam incidisse arbitrātī.

 Hac oratione habita, postquam extremum palum igni calefecit, oculum
 Polyphemi dormientis ferventi ligno perfodit; quo facto omnes in
 diversas speluncae partis se abdiderunt. At ille subito illo dolore
 oculi e somno excitatus clamorem terribilem sustulit, et dum per
 speluncam errat, Ulixem manu prehendere conabatur; cum tamen iam omnino
 caecus esset, nullo modo hoc efficere potuit. Interea reliqui Cyclopes
 clamore audito undique ad speluncam convenerunt, et ad introitum
 adstantes quid Polyphemus ageret quaesiverunt, et quam ob causam tantum
 clamorem sustulisset. Ille respondit se graviter vulneratum esse et
 magno dolore adfici. Cum tamen postea quaesivissent quis ei vim
 intulisset, respondit ille Neminem id fecisse; quibus rebus auditis
 unus e Cyclopibus: "At si nemo," inquit, "te vulneravit, haud dubium
 est quin consilio deorum, quibus resistere nec possumus nec volumus,
 hoc supplicio adficiaris." Hoc cum dixisset, abierunt Cyclopes eum in
 insaniam incidisse arbitrati.

After this speech was over, and after he'd heated the end of the stake
in the fire, Ulysses stabbed the sleeping Polyphemus in the eye with
the burning wood. While this took place everyone hid in different
parts of the cave.  But Polyphemus, jerked from sleep by the pain in
his eye, raised a frightful roar, and blundering through the cave,
tried to catch Ulysses in his fist; but since he was already
completely blind, he couldn't accomplish this no how.  In the meantime
the rest of the Cyclopes heard the uproar and converged on the cave
from every direction, and, standing at the entrance, asked Polyphemus
what was going on and what he was raising such a ruckus for. He
answered that he was gravely wounded and afflicted with great
pain. But when they then asked who had offered him violence, he
replied that Nobody had done it.  When they heard this, one of the
Cyclopes said, "But if nobody has wounded you, then doubtless it was
the decision of the gods.  And opposing them, who are afflicting you
with this punishment, is something we neither can or wish to do."
After he'd said this, the Cyclopes left, having decided that he had
fallen into insanity.
