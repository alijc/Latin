90. THE ESCAPE

Polyphēmus, ubi sociōs suōs abiisse sēnsit, furōre atque āmentiā
impulsus Ulixem iterum quaerere coepit; tandem cum portam
invēnisset, saxum quō obstructa erat āmovit, ut pecus in agrōs
exīret. Tum ipse in introitū cōnsēdit, et ut quaeque ovis ad hunc
locum vēnerat, eius tergum manibus tractābat, nē virī inter ovēs
exīre possent. Quod cum animadvertisset Ulixēs, intellēxit omnem
spem salūtis in dolō magis quam in virtūte ponī. Itaque hoc
cōnsilium iniit. Prīmum trēs quās vīdit pinguissimās ex ovibus
dēlēgit, quās cum inter sē vīminibus coniūnxisset, ūnum ex sociīs
suīs ventribus eārum ita subiēcit ut omnīnō latēret; deinde ovēs
hominem sēcum ferentēs ad portam ēgit. Id accidit quod fore
suspicātus erat. Polyphēmus enim postquam terga ovium manibus
tractāvit, eās praeterīre passus est. Ulixēs ubi rem tam fēlīciter
ēvēnisse vīdit, omnēs sociōs suōs ex ōrdine eōdem modō ēmīsit;
quō factō ipse nōvissimus ēvāsit.

 Polyphemus ubi socios suos abiisse sensit, furore atque amentia
 impulsus Ulixem iterum quaerere coepit; tandem cum portam
 invenisset, saxum quo obstructa erat amovit, ut pecus in agros
 exiret. Tum ipse in introitu consedit, et ut quaeque ovis ad hunc
 locum venerat, eius tergum manibus tractabat, ne viri inter ovis
 exire possent. Quod cum animadvertisset Ulixes, intellexit omnem
 spem salutis in dolo magis quam in virtute poni. Itaque hoc
 consilium iniit. Primum tris quas vidit pinguissimas ex ovibus
 delegit, quas cum inter se viminibus coniunxisset, unum ex sociis
 suis ventribus earum ita subiecit ut omnino lateret; deinde ovis
 hominem secum ferentis ad portam egit. Id accidit quod fore
 suspicatus erat. Polyphemus enim postquam terga ovium manibus
 tractavit, eas praeterire passus est. Ulixes ubi rem tam
 feliciter evenisse vidit, omnis socios suos ex ordine eodem modo
 emisit; quo facto ipse novissimus evasit.

When Polyphemus realized that his companions had gone away, he again
began, driven by rage and frenzy, to search for Ulysses.  Finally,
when he'd reached the entrance, he moved the stone that it was
blocked up with so his flock could go out into the fields.  Then
he settled himself in the entrance and drew his hands along each
sheep's back as passed him, so that the men could not get out
among the sheep.  When Ulysses noticed this, he realized that
their only hope of salvation lay in trickery rather than in
courage. And so he undertook this plan.  First off, he picked out
the three fattest sheep that he saw, and after he had bound them
together with withies, stuck one of his companions under their
bellies so that he was entirely concealed.  Next he drove the
sheep that carried the man with them to the entrance.  It happened
that that man mistrusted the door.  In fact, after Polyphemus drew his
hands over the sheep's back, he allowed them to pass by.  When
Ulysses saw that the thing had turned out so happily, he sent all
of his companions out, one by one.  He was the last to escape in
this fashion.
