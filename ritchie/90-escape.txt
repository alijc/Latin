90. THE ESCAPE

Polyphēmus, ubi sociōs suōs abiisse sēnsit, furōre atque āmentiā
impulsus Ulixem iterum quaerere coepit; tandem cum portam
invēnisset, saxum quō obstructa erat āmovit, ut pecus in agrōs
exīret. Tum ipse in introitū cōnsēdit, et ut quaeque ovis ad hunc
locum vēnerat, eius tergum manibus tractābat, nē virī inter ovēs
exīre possent. Quod cum animadvertisset Ulixēs, intellēxit omnem
spem salūtis in dolō magis quam in virtūte ponī. Itaque hoc
cōnsilium iniit. Prīmum trēs quās vīdit pinguissimās ex ovibus
dēlēgit, quās cum inter sē vīminibus coniūnxisset, ūnum ex sociīs
suīs ventribus eārum ita subiēcit ut omnīnō latēret; deinde ovēs
hominem sēcum ferentēs ad portam ēgit. Id accidit quod fore
suspicātus erat. Polyphēmus enim postquam terga ovium manibus
tractāvit, eās praeterīre passus est. Ulixēs ubi rem tam fēlīciter
ēvēnisse vīdit, omnēs sociōs suōs ex ōrdine eōdem modō ēmīsit;
quō factō ipse nōvissimus ēvāsit.

When Polyphemus realized that his companions had gone away, he again
began, driven by rage and frenzy, to search for Ulysses.  Finally,
when he'd reached the entrance, he moved the stone that it was
blocked up with so his flock could go out into the fields.  Then
he settled himself in the entrance and drew his hands along each
sheep's back as passed him, so that the men could not get out
among the sheep.  When Ulysses noticed this, he realized that
their only hope of salvation lay in trickery rather than in
courage. And so he undertook this plan.  First off, he picked out
the three fattest sheep that he saw, and after he had bound them
together with withies, stuck one of his companions under their
bellies so that he was entirely concealed.  Next he drove the
sheep that carried the man with them to the entrance.  It happened
just as he'd supposed.  In fact, after Polyphemus drew his
hands over the sheep's back, he allowed them to pass by.  When
Ulysses saw that the thing had turned out so happily, he sent all
of his companions out, one by one.  He was the last to escape in
this fashion.
