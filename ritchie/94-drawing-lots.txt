94. A DRAWING OF LOTS

Brevī spatiō intermissō, Graecī īnsulae cuidam appropinquāvērunt
in quā Circē, fīlia Sōlis, habitābat. Quō cum nāvem appulisset,
Ulixēs in terram frumentandī causā ēgrediendum esse statuit; nam
cognōverat frūmentum quod in nāvī habērent iam dēficere. Sociīs
igitur ad sē convocātīs quō in locō rēs esset et quid fierī vellet
ostendit. Cum tamen omnēs memoriā tenērent quam crudelī morte
necātī essent eī quī nuper ē nāvī ēgressī essent, nēmō repertus est
quī hoc negōtium suscipere vellet. Quae cum ita essent, rēs ad
contrōversiam dēducta est. Tandem Ulixēs consensū omnium
sociōs in duās partēs divīsit, quārum alterī Eurylochus, vir summae 
virtūtis, alterī ipse praeesset. Tum hī inter sē sortītī sunt ūter in
terram ēgrederētur. Hōc factō, Eurylochō sorte ēvēnit ut cum
duōbus et vigintī sociīs rem susciperet.

 Brevi spatio intermisso Graeci insulae cuidam appropinquaverunt
 in qua Circe, filia Solis, habitabat. Quo cum navem appulisset,
 Ulixes in terram frumentandi causa egrediendum esse statuit;
 nam cognoverat frumentum quod in navi haberent iam
 deficere. Sociis igitur ad se convocatis quo in loco res esset
 et quid fieri vellet ostendit. Cum tamen omnes memoria tenerent
 quam crudeli morte necati essent ii qui nuper e navi egressi
 essent, nemo repertus est qui hoc negotium suscipere
 vellet. Quae cum ita essent, res ad controversiam deducta
 est. Tandem Ulixes consensu omnium socios in duas partis
 divisit, quarum alteri Eurylochus, vir summae virtutis, alteri
 ipse praeesse. Tum hi inter se sortiti sunt uter in terram
 egrederetur. Hoc facto, Eurylocho sorte evenit ut cum duobus et
 viginti sociis rem susciperet.

After a short stretch of time the Greeks approached a certain
island on which Circe, the daughter of the Sun, lived.  When the
ship put ashore there, Ulysses decided that they had to
disembark in order to forage; for he'd realized that the
foodstuffs that they had onboard were running low.  Therefore he
assembled his comrades and pointed out how the matter lay and
what he wanted to be done.  But since everyone held in memory
how those who disembarked from the ship had not long before had
been murdered by a cruel death, no one was found who wanted to
undertake this task.  Because of this, the matter turned into a
quarrel. At last Ulysses, with the consent of everyone, divided
his companions into two parts, one of which was to be led by
Eurylochus, a man of great courage, and the other by himself.
Then they cast lots among themselves for which group would
disembark.  When this was done, it came out that the fate fell
to Eurylochus to undertake the business with two and twenty of
their companions.
