96. THE CHARM

Tum Circē, quae artis magicae summam scientiam habēbat, baculō
aureō quod gerēbat capita eōrum tetigit; quō factō omnēs in porcōs
subitō conversī sunt. Intereā Eurylochus ignārus quid in aedibus
agerētur ad ōstium sedēbat; postquam tamen ad sōlis occāsum
anxiō animō et sollicitō exspectāvit, sōlus ad nāvem regredī
constituit. Eō cum vēnisset, sollicitūdine ac timōre tam perturbātus
fuit ut quae vīdisset vix dīlūcidē narrāre posset. Ulixēs autem satis
intellēxit sociōs suōs in periculō versārī, et gladiō correptō
Eurylochō imperāvit ut sine morā viam ad istam domum
dēmōnstrāret. Ille tamen multīs cum lacrimīs Ulixem complexus
obsecrāre coepit nē in tantum periculum sē committeret; sī quid
gravius eī accidisset, omnium salūtem in summō discrīmine
futūram. Ulixēs autem respondit sē nēminem invītum sēcum
adductūrum; eī licēre, sī mallet, in nāvī manēre; sē ipsum sine ūllō
praesidiō rem susceptūrum. Hoc cum magnā vōce dīxisset, ē nāvī
dēsiluit et nūllō sequente sōlus in viam sē dedit.

 Tum Circe, quae artis magicae summam scientiam habebat, baculo aureo
 quod gerebat capita eorum tetigit; quo facto omnes in porcos subito
 conversi sunt. Interea Eurylochus ignarus quid in aedibus ageretur
 ad ostium sedebat; postquam tamen ad solis occasum anxio animo et
 sollicito exspectavit, solus ad navem regredi constituit. Eo cum
 venisset, sollicitudine ac timore tam perturbatus fuit ut quae
 vidisset vix dilucide narrare posset. Ulixes autem satis intellexit
 socios suos in periculo versari, et gladio correpto Eurylocho
 imperavit ut sine mora viam ad istam domum demonstraret. Ille tamen
 multis cum lacrimis Ulixem complexus obsecrare coepit ne in tantum
 periculum se committeret; si quid gravius ei accidisset, omnium
 salutem in summo discrimine futuram. Ulixes autem respondit se
 neminem invitum secum adducturum; ei licere, si mallet, in navi
 manere; se ipsum sine ullo praesidio rem suscepturum. Hoc cum magna
 voce dixisset, e navi desiluit et nullo sequente solus in viam se
 dedit.

Then Circe, who had the ultimate knowledge of the art of magic,
struck them with the golden staff that she was carrying.  After this
they were all suddenly transformed into pigs.  In the meantime
Eurylochus was sitting by the front door, unaware of what was
happening inside the house; but after he had waited until sundown
with an anxious and a worried heart, he decided to go back to the
ship by himself.  When he got there, he was so alarmed with anxiety
and dread that he could barely relate the things that he had seen in
a lucid way.  But Ulysses understood well enough that his companions
were in danger, and, seizing his sword, commanded Eurylochus to show
them the way to the house without delay.  But he, with many tears,
clung to Ulysses and began to beseech him not to entrust himself to
such danger; if anything more serious were to happen to him, the
well-being of everyone would be in a most acute crisis.  But Ulysses
replied that he wasn't about to take anyone with him against their
will.  Eurylochus would be allowed, if he wished, to remain on the
ship.  He himself would undertake the matter without any help.  After
he said this in a loud voice, he leapt down from the ship and, with
no one following, applied himself to the road.
