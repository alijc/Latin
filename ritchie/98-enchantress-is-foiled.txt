98. THE ENCHANTRESS IS FOILED

Brevī intermissō spatiō Ulixēs ad omnia perīcula subeunda parātus
iānuam pulsāvit, et foribus patēfactīs ab ipsā Circē benignē
exceptus est. Omnia eōdem modō atque anteā facta sunt. Cēnam
magnificē instrūctam vīdit et accumbere iussus est. Mox, ubi famēs
cibō depulsa est, Circē pōculum aureum vīnō replētum Ulixī dedit.
Ille etsī suspicātus est venēnum sibi parātum esse, pōculum
exhausit; quō factō Circē postquam caput eius baculō tetigit, ea
verba locūta est quibus sociōs eius anteā in porcōs converterat. Rēs
tamen omnīnō aliter ēvēnit atque illa sperāverat. Tanta enim vīs
erat eius herbae quam Ulixī Mercūrius dederat ut neque venēnum
neque verba quicquam efficere possent. Ulixēs autem, ut eī
praeceptum erat, gladiō strictō impetum in eam fēcit et mortem
minitābātur. Circē cum artem suam nihil valēre sēnsisset, multīs
cum lacrimīs eum obsecrāre coepit nē sibi vītam adimeret.

Ulysses stopped briefly, then, ready to undergo all perils, pounded
on the entrance. After Circe herself had thrown open the doors, he
was courteously received.  Everything happened in the same way as
before.  He saw a splendidly laid out dinner and was ordered to sit
down. Soon, when his hunger had been dispelled by the food, Circe
gave Ulysses a gold cup that was filled with wine.  Even though he
suspected that a drug had been prepared for him, he drained the
cup. When this was done Circe next struck his head with her wand,
and spoke the words with which she had transformed his companions
into pigs.  But the matter turned out entirely otherwise than she
had hoped. For such was the power of the herb that Mercury had given
to Ulysses that neither drug nor words were able to accomplish
anything.  But Ulysses, as he had been instructed, launched an
assault on her with his drawn sword and threatened her with death.
When Circe realized that her wiles had availed her nothing, she
began to tearfully entreat him not to take away her life.
