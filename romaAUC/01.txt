Aeneas Arrives in Italy

After Troy was betrayed to the Greeks by Antenore and other leaders,
Aeneas got out of the city by night,
carrying the household gods and his father Anchises in his arms
and leading his little son by the hand,
At daybreak he made for Mount Ida.
Then he built ships and left Troy with great wealth and many companions,
and after a long sea voyage through the shores of many lands, came to Italy.
