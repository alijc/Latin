Roma condita

Proca, rex Albanorum, duos filios habuit, Amulium et Numitorem,
quibus regnum annuis vicibus habendum reliquit. Sed Amulius fratri
imperium non dedit; et, ut eum subole privaret, filiam eius, Rheam
Silviam, Vestae sacerdotem praefecit, ut virginitate perpetua teneretur.
Quae, a Marte compressa, Remum et Romulum edidit. Amulius
ipsam in vincula compegit; parvulos in Tiberim abiecit. Quos aqua
in sicco reliquit. Ad vagitum lupa accurrit eosque uberibus suis aluit.
Mox Faustulus pastor eos collectos Accae Larentiae coniugi educandos
dedit. Qui postea, Amulio interfecto, Numitori avo regnum
restituerunt; ipsi, pastoribus contractis, civitatem condiderunt, quam
Romulus augurio victor, quod ipse duodecim, Remus sex vultures
viderat, Romam vocavit. Et, ut eam potius legibus muniret quam
moenibus, edixit ne quis vallum transiliret. Quod Remus inridens
transiluit et a Celere centurione rastro fertur occisus esse.‚Äù

Rome preserved

Proca, the king of the Albians, had two sons, Amulius and Numitore,
to whom he had relinguished his realm in alternating years.  But Amulius
didn't yield the kingdom to his brother; and to deprive him of progeny,
made his daughter, Rhea Silvia, a priestess of Vesta, to keep her a virgin
forever. But she was raped by Mars, and gave birth to Remus and Romulus.
Amulius bound her in chains and threw the little boys into the Tiber.
And the water left them on dry land.  A she-wolf rushed to the crying,
and fed them from her own teats.  Soon the shepherd Faustulus gathered
them up and gave them to his wife Acca Larentia to be brought up.
And later, after killing Amulius, they restored his kingdom to their
grandfather Numitore; then they gathered up the shepherds and built a
city, which Romulus, given the victory by an augury in which he'd seen
twelve vultures to Remus' six, named Rome.  And, in order to defend it
with laws more than with walls, he proclaimed that no-one was permitted
to jump over the wall.  Which Remus jumped over, laughing, and is said
to have been killed by the centurion Celere with a mattock.
