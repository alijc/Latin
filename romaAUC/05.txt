Tarquinii expelluntur

Cum Tarquinius Superbus, ultimus rex Romanorum, Ardeam obsideret,
Tarquinius Collatinus, consobrino regis genitus, in contubernio
filiorum regiorum erat. Cum forte in liberiore convivio coniugem suam
unus quisque laudaret, placuit eis experiri.  Itaque equis Romam
petunt.  Regias nurus in convivio et luxu deprehendunt.  Inde
Collatiam petunt.  Lucretiam inter ancillas in lanificio offendunt.
Itaque ea pudicissima iudicatur.  Ad quam corrumpendam Tarquinius
Sextus noctu Collatiam rediit et iure propinquitatis domum Collatini
venit et, in cubiculum Lucretiae inrumpens, pudicitiam expugnavit.
Illa igitur postero die, advocatis Tricipitino patre et Collatino
coniuge, rem exposuit et se cultro, quem veste texerat, occidit.
Deinde Tricipitinus et Collatinus cum Iunio Bruto, sorore regis
genito, in exitium Tarquiniorum coniuraverunt, eorumque exsilio
mortem Lucretiae vindicaverunt.  Tarquinius Superbus ad Porsennam
Etruriae regem confugit, cuius ope regnum recuperare tentavit.  Roma
pulsus, Cumas concessit, ubi per summam ignominiam reliquum vitae
tempus exegit.  Tarquiniis in exsilium actis Brutus Collatinus primi
consules creati sunt.


The Tarquini are expelled

When Tarquinius The Proud, the last king of the Romans, was besieging
Ardea, Tarquinius Collatinius, the king's cousin by birth, was mates
with the king's sons. When, in the course of a pretty rollicking
banquet, someone or other chanced to praise his own wife, it struck
their fancy to put it to the test.  And so they made for Rome on
horseback.  They caught the royal daughters-in-law red-handed at a
luxurious banquet.  From there they made for Collatia.  They came
upon Lucretia, working wool with her maids.  And so this woman was
judged to be very virtuous.  Tarquinius Sextus returned to Collatia
by night to violate her.  He came, by right of his relationship with
Collatinius, to his house, and forcing himself into Lucretia's bed,
assaulted her chasity.  Therefore on the next day she related the
affair to witnesses - her father Tricipitinus and her husband
Collatinius - and killed herself with a knife that she had hidden in
her clothing.  Then Tricipitinus and Collatinius, with Junius Brutus,
the king's sister's son, formed an alliance to destory the Tarquini
and with their exile they avenged the death of Lucretia.  Tarquinius
the Proud fled to King Porsenna of Etruria, and attempted to use his
influence to recover his kingdom.  Driven out of Rome, he departed
for Cumae, where he passed the remainder of his life in the utmost
disgrace.  With the Tarquini driven into exile, Brutus and
Collatinius were the first men to be elected consuls.
