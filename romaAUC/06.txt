Horatii atque Mucii res fortiter gestae

Cum Porsenna, rex Etruscorum, Tarquinios in urbem restituere temptaret
et primo impetu Ianiculum cepisset, Horatius Cocles
(illo cognomine, quod in alio proelio oculum amiserat)
pro Ponte Sublicio stetit et aciem hostium, primo cum duobus aliis,
tunc, illis regressis, solus sustinuit, donec pons a tergo interruptus est.
Cum quo in Tiberim decidit et armatus ad suos tranavit.
Ob hoc ei tantum agri publici datum est,
quantum uno die ambire vomere potui.
Statua quoque in Vulcanali posita est.

Deinde dum Porsenna urbem obsidet, Mucius Cordus, vir Romanae constantiae,
senatum adiit et veniam transfugiendi petiit, necem regis promittens.
Accepta potestate, in castra Porsennae venit
ibique aliquem purpuratum pro rege deceptus occidit.
Apprehensus et ad regem pertractus, dextram arae flammis imposuit.
Unde cum misericordia regis abstraheretur,
quasi beneficium referens, ait trecentos adversus eum similes coniurasse.
Qua re ille territus, bellum, acceptis obsidibus, deposuit.
Mucio prata trans Tiberim data sunt, ab eo Mucia appellata.
Statua quoque ei honoris causa constituta est.


The brave deeds of Horatius and Mucius

When Porsenna, the king of the Etruscans, was trying to restore the Tarquins
to Rome and and had seized the gates in his first assault, Horatius the One-eyed
(so named, because he had lost an eye in another battle)
stood firm before the Pile Bridge and the enemy's front line,
with two others at first, then after the others retreated, held them back alone,
until the bridge behind him was broken up.
At which point he dropped into the Tiber and swam across to his own side,
with his arms.
On account of this he was given as much land as he could plow around in one day.
Likewise, a statue was placed in Vulcan's temple in his honor.

Then, while Porsenna was besieging Rome, Mucius Cordus,
a man of Roman steadfastness,
went to the senate and requested permission to go over to the enemy,
promising the death of the king.
After he received this power, he entered Porsenna's camp and,
deceived, there killed someone dressed in purple in place of the king.
Caught and dragged before the king, he put his right hand into the flame of the
altar. 
When he was dragged away from it, by the mercy of the king,
he said, as if returning a kindness,
that three hundred men had sworn to do the same to him.
At which the king, terrified, called off the war, after accepting hostages.
Meadows on the other side of the Tiber were given to Mucius,
called Mucia, after his name.
A statue was likewise erected in his honor.
