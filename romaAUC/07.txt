Facinus Appii Claudii

Populus Romanus cum seditiosos magistratus ferre non posset,
decemviros legibus scribendis creavit,
qui eas ex libris Solonis translatas duodecim tabulis exposuerunt.
Sed cum pacto dominationis magistratum sibi prorogarent,
unus ex his Appius Claudius Virginiam,
Virginii centurionis filiam in Algido monte militantis, amare coepit.
Quam cum corrumpere non posset, clientem subornavit,
qui eam in servitium deposceret,
facile victurus cum ipse esset et accusator et iudex.
Pater, re cognita,
cum ipso die iudicii supervenisset et filiam iam addictam videret,
ultimo eius colloquio impetrato,
eam in secretum abduxit et occidit,
et corpus eius umeris gerens ad exercitum profugit
et milites ad vindicandum facinus accendit.
Qui, creatis decem tribunis, Aventinum occuparunt, 
decemviros abdicare se magistratu coegerunt,
eosque omnes aut morte aut exsilio punierunt.
Appius Claudius in carcere necatus est.


The crime of Appius Claudius

When the magistrate could no longer deal with quarrelsome men,
the Roman people elected a commission of ten to write down the laws,
and they published twelve tablets of laws translated from the books of Solon.
But when by agreement of power they extended the magistracy to themselves,
one of them, Appius Claudius fell in love with Virginia,
the daughter of the centurion Virginius, who was serving on Mount Algidus.
And when he could not seduce her, he suborned one of his dependents
to demand her as his slave. And he'd easily succeed at this,
since he himself would be both prosecutor and judge.
When her father learned of the business
and had arrived on the very day of the trial,
he saw that his daughter had already been sentenced.
He asked for one last conversation with her and took her aside and killed her,
and fled to the army carrying her body in his arms
and roused the soldiers to avenge the crime.
And they, after electing ten tribunes, seized the Aventine hill,
forced the commission of ten to resign the magistracy,
and punished them all with either death or exile.
Appius Claudius was put to death in prison.
