Roma a Gallis capta

Cum Galli Senones, relictis ob sterilitatem agris suis,
Clusium Italiae oppidum obsiderent,
missi sunt Roma tres Fabii qui Gallos monerent ut ab oppugnatione desisterent.
Ex his unus contra ius gentium in aciem processit et ducem Senonum interfecit.
Quo commoti Galli, petitis in deditionem legatis nec impetratis,
Romam petierunt et exercitum Romanum apud Alliam fluvium ceciderunt,
die xvi ante Kalendas Augustas,
qui dies inter nefastos relatus est, "Alliensis" dictus.
Victores Galli urbem intraverunt,
ubi nobilissimos senum in sellis curulibus et honorum insignibus primo
ut deos venerati sunt;
deinde ut homines despicientes interfecerunt.
Iuventus cum Manlio in Capitolium fugit,
ubi quadam nocte, clangore anseris excitata, Gallos ascendentes deiecit.
Tunc Camillus, absens dictator dictus,
collectis reliquis Romanis, Gallos improviso impetu occidit.
Populum Romanum, migrare Veios nuper captos volentem, retinuit.
Sic et oppidum civibus et cives oppido reddidit.

 
Rome captured by the Gauls

After the Senones of Gaul, leaving their own fields on account of barrenness,
besieged the town of Clusium in Italy,
three Fabii were sent from Rome to warn the Gauls to stop their assault.
One of these, contrary to the law of nations, advanced with a drawn sword
and killed the leader of the Senones.
Now the Gauls were upset by this and,
after asking for the envoys to be surrendered and not getting them, 
attacked Rome and slaughtered the Roman army by the River Allia
on the 16th day before the August Kalends.
This day is reputed to be cursed - called the "Day of the River Allia".
The Gallic conquerors entered the city,
where they at first venerated, like gods,
the most noble of old men on curules' chairs with marks of honor;
then, like contemptuous men, they killed them.
The youth fled with Manlius to the Capitoline hill,
where one night, woken by the honking of a goose,
he knocked down the climbing Gauls.
Then Camillus, appointed dictator in his absence,
gathered up the rest of the Romans and
slaughtered the Gauls in an unexpected attack.
He restrained the Roman people,
who wished to move to the recently captured town of Veii.
Thus he restored both the town to the citizens and the citizens to the town.
