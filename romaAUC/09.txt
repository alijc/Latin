A. Victoria Pyrrhi

Pyrrhus, rex Epirotarum, Apollinem de bello cum Romanis gerendo consuluit.
Deus ei ambigue respondit: "Aio te, Aeacida, Romanos vincere posse."
Hoc dicto incitatus, auxilio Tarentinorum bellum Romanis intulit,
eosque apud Heracleam elephantorum novitate turbavit.
Victor tandem, cum Romanos adversis vulneribus occisos videret,
"Ego," inquit, "talibus militibus brevi orbem terrarum subigere potuissem."
Amicis autem gratulantibus,
"Quid mihi cum tali victoria," inquit, "ubi exercitus robur amittam?"
Postea, viso altero exercitu Romano, eandem sibi ait fuisse fortunam
adversum Romanos quam Herculi adversum Hydram.

B. Fortitudo Reguli

Marcus Atilius Regulus consul, fusis Sallentinis, triumphavit 
primusque Romanorum ducum in Africam classem traiecit.
Ibi de Hamilcare naves longas tres et sexaginta et oppida ducenta et hominum
ducenta milia cepit.
Absente eo, coniugi eius et liberis ob paupertatem sumptus publice dabantur.
Mox, arte Xanthippi Lacedaemonii mercenarii militis captus,
in carcerem ductus est.
Tunc legatus de permutandis captivis Romam missus,
dato iureiurando ut, si non impetrasset, Carthaginem rediret,
in senatu condicionem dissuasit, reiectisque ab amplexu coniuge et liberis,
Carthaginem regressus est,
ubi in arcam ligneam coniectus, clavis introrsum adactis,
vigiliis ac dolore punitus est.


A. Pyrrhus' Victory

Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, consulted Apollo about waging war on the Romans.
The god answered him ambiguously:
"I tell you, son of Aeacides, with the Romans, victory is a possibility."
Urged on this this speech, he brought war to the Romans with the aid of
the Tarentinians, and threw them in confusion at Heraclea with the novelty
of elephants.
He won in the end, and said, after seeing dead Romans with wounds on their
fronts, "With such soldiers I could subjugate the whole world in short order."
But when friends offered congratulations he said,
"What is such a victory to me, when I have lost the might of an army."
Later, after seeing another Roman army,
he said to himself that fortune against the Romans was the same as
Hercules against the Hydra.

B. The Courage of Regulus

The consul Marcus Atilius Regulus
celebrated a triumph after routing the Sallentines,
and was first Roman general to transport a fleet to Africa.
There he captured sixty-three galleys, two hundred towns and two hundred
thousand men from Hamilcar.
In Regulus' absence, public funds were given to his wife and children
on account of their poverty.
Then, through the skill of the Spartan mercenary Xanthippius, he was captured
and conducted to prison.
Later, he was sent to Rome as an ambassador for the exchange of captives,
after swearing an oath that, if he didn't succeed, he would return to Carthage.
He advised against the terms in the senate,
and, after refusing to embrace his wife and children,
went back to Carthage,
where he was thrown into a wooden chest with spikes driven into it,
and punished with wakefulness and pain.
