Hannibalis virtutes et vitia

A. Quis Carthaginiensium pluris fuit Hannibale consilio, virtute, rebus
gestis, qui unus cum tot imperatoribus nostris, per tot annos, de imperio et
de gloria decertavit?  Hunc sui cives e civitate eiecerunt; nos etiam hostem
litteris nostris et memoria videmus esse celebratum.  Nam callidissimum
Hannibalem ex Poenorum ducibus, ut Quintum Maximum ex nostris, accepimus,
celare, tacere, dissimulare, insidiari, praeripere hostium consilia.  Sed
Hannibalem propter crudelitatem semper haec civitas oderit.

B.  Numquam ingenium idem ad res diversissimas, parendum atqve imperandum,
habilius fuit.  Itaque haud facile discerneres utrum imperatori Hasdrubali
an exercitui carior esset.  Plurimum audaciae ad pericula capessenda,
plurimum consilii inter ipsa pericula ei erat; nullo labore aut corpus
fatigari aut animus vinci poterat; caloris ac frigoris patientia par.
Equitum peditumque idem longe primus erat; princeps in proelium ibat;
ultimus, conserto proelio, excedebat.  Has tantas viri virtutes ingentia
vitia aequabant: inhumana crudelitas, perfidia plus quam Punica, nihil veri,
nihil sancti, nullus deum metus, nullum ius iurandum, nulla religio.14


Hannibal's virtues and faults

A. Who of the Carthaginians was greater than Hannibal in planning, in
courage, in his deeds, who single-handly fought with so many of our
generals, for so many years, for power and fame.  His fellow citizens
threw this man out of his city; but we see him, although our enemy, as an
honored man in our records and memory.  For we held Hannibal to be the most
skillful of Carthage's commanders, as Quintus Maximus is of our own, in
keeping secrets, silence, concealment, plotting, in preempting the choices
of the enemy.  But this city will always hate Hannibal on account of his
cruelty.

B. There was never anyone like him who was so fit for obeying and
commanding.  And so it was extremely hard to tell whether he was dearer to
General Hasdrubal or to the army.  He had the greatest boldness for
undertaking danger, the best planning in the midst of danger.  There was no
toil that could either weary his body or overcome his mind; he had equal
endurance to heat and cold.  Likewise, he was far and away the foremost of
calvary and infantry; He would be the first to advance into battle; and the
last to withdraw after the fight had been joined.  The man's remarkable faults
were the equal of these great virtues; inhuman cruelty, treachery even more
than Carthagian, nothing just, nothing sacred, fearing no god, obeying no law,
honoring no religion.
