Catonis ingenium

M. igitur Cato idem summus imperator, idem sapiens, idem orator,
idem historiae conditor, idem iuris, idem rerum rusticarum peritissimus
fuit. 
Quem virum, di boni! 
Quis illo gravior in laudando, acerbior in vituperando,
in sententiis argutior, in docendo edisserendoque subtilior?
In omnibus rebus singulari fuit industria.
Inter tot operas militiae, tantas domi contentiones, rudi saeculo,
litteras Graecas, aetate iam declinata, didicit.
Quarum studium etsi senior adripuerat,
tamen tantum progressum fecit, ut nihil facile reperiri possit, neque de
Graecis neque de Italicis rebus, quod ei fuerit incognitum.
Ab adulescentia confecit orationes, quae refertae sunt et verbis et rebus
illustribus.
Senex historias scribere instituit; earum sunt libri septem.
Liber primus continet res gestas regum populi Romani, secundus et
tertius unde quaeque civitas orta sit Italica,
ob quam rem omnes Origines videtur appellasse.
In quarto autem est bellum Punicum primum, in quinto secundum;
atque haec omnia capitulatim sunt dicta.
In iisdem exposuit quae in Italia Hispaniisque aut fierent aut viderentur
admiranda; in quibus multa industria et diligentia comparet, nulla doctrina.

Reliqua quoque bella pari modo persecutus est usque ad praeturam Servii Galbae,
qui diripuit Lusitanos.12

Atque horum bellorum omnium duces non nominavit,
sed sine nominibus ræ notavit.
Elephantum tamen, qui fortissime proeliatus æset in Punica acie,
Surum tradidit vocatum, altero dente mutilato.13

 
The character of Cato

M. Cato was, therefore, at once an outstanding commander, a wise man, an orator,
an author of histories, a justice, and most experienced in rural matters.
Good gods! but what a man!
Who was more serious than he in praise, harsher in reproach,
more eloquent in opinions, more thorough in teaching and explaining?
in all matters he had a unique diligence.
In the midst of such great military service and domestic strife, in a rough age,
in the decline of his life, he learned Greek.
Although he had taken up this study as a senior citizen,
nevertheless he made so much progress that nothing can be easily found,
either about Greek or Italian matters, that he didn't know about.
From his youth he prepared speeches, filled with brilliant words and matters.
As an old man he decided to write histories; there were seven books of them.
The first book contains the military deeds of the kings of the Roman people,
and the second and third on whichever city Italy must have risen from,
on account of which he seems to have called the whole work "Origins".
But in fourth is the First Punic Way, int the fifth the second;
and all these things are stated by headings.
In the same books he set forth what was or seemed remarkable in Italy and Spain;
in which much purposefulness and diligence appears, but no education.
