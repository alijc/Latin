Cato senex

Quartum ago annum et octogesimum; et hoc queo dicere, non me quidem
eis esse viribus, quibus aut miles bello Punico aut quaestor eodem
bello aut consul in Hispania fuerim aut quadriennio post, cum
tribunus militaris depugnavi apud Thermopylas, M. Glabrione
consule, sed tamen, ut vos videtis, non plane me enervavit, non
adflixit senectus, non curia vires meas desiderat, non rostra, non
amici, non clientes, non hospites.

Non enim viribus aut velocitate aut celeritate corporum res magnae
geruntur, sed consilio, auctoritate, sententia; quibus non modo non
orbari, sed etiam augeri senectus solet.  Nisi forte ego, qui et
miles et tribunus et legatus et consul versatus sum in vario genere
bellorum, vobis cessare nunc videor, cum bella non gero.  At
senatui, quae sint gerenda, praescribo, et quo modo.  Carthagini
male iam diu cogitanti bellum multo ante denuntio; de qua vereri
non ante desinam quam illam excisam esse cognovero.  Quam palmam
utinam di immortales, Scipio, tibi reservent, ut avi reliquias
persequare!

Septimus mihi liber Originum est in manibus; omnia antiquitatis
monumenta colligo; causarum illustrium, quascumque defendi, nunc
conficio Orationes; ius augurium, pontificium, civile tracto;
multum etiam Graecis litteris utor.  Itaque corporis vires non
magno opere desidero.  Adsum amicis, venio in senatum frequens
ultroque adfero res multum et diu cogitatas easque tueor animi, non
corporis, viribus.  Ita sensim sine sensu aetas senescit nec subito
frangitur, sed diuturnitate exstinguitur.

 
Cato as an old man

I am in my eighty-fourth year; and I can say this, that I certainly
don't have the strength that I had as soldier in the Punic War, or
quartermaster in the same war, or consul in Spain, or for four
years afterwards.  I did battle at Thermopylae with the military
tribunes when M. Glabrion was consul, but nevertheless, as you see,
it clearly did not weaken me, nor has old age afflicted me, nor
does the senate miss my strength, nor the rostra, nor my friends,
nor my clients, nor my guests.

For is not by bodily strength or swiftness or speed that a great
thing is done, but by planning, authority, and thought.  Not only
are the aged not generally deprived of these things, but they are
even enriched in them.  Unless perhaps I, who have been soldier and
tribune and legate and consul in different sorts of wars, now seem
to you to be remiss, because I do not wage wars.  But for the
senate, these things must be done, I will prescribe what is to be
done, and how.  I declare war against Carthage, which has beening
contemplating an unjust war for ages.  I won't stop fearing it
until I've learned that it has been destroyed.  Scipio, if only the
immortal gods would save this victory for you, so that you might
accomplish what your grandfather left to be done.

I'm working on the seventh book of my "Origins"; I assemble all the
records of antiquity; of illustrious subjects, whichever I support.
I'm now completing "Orations"; I discuss augural, pontifical and
civil law; I also make great use of Greek literature.  And so I
don't want a great labor from bodily strength.  I am at hand for my
friends, I frequently come into the senate and besides I have long
brought proposals to be deliberated and I see them with the
strength of my mind, not my body.  So, slowly, without being
noticed, one's life declines.  It doesn't suddenly break, but is
extinguished over a long time.
