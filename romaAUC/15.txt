Graecia liberata

Philippo Macedoniae rege superato, cum ad Isthmicum spectaculum
tota Graecia convenisset, T. Quinctius Flamininus, tubae signo
siientio facto, per praeconem haec verba recitari iussit: "Senatus
Populusque Romanus et Titus Quinctius Flamininus imperator omnes
Graeciae urbes, quae sub dicione Philippi regis fuerunt, liberas
atque immunes esse iubet."  Quibus auditis, maximo et inopinato
gaudio homines perculsi primo, velut non audisse se quae audierant
credentes, obticuerunt.  Iterata deinde pronuntiatione praeconis,
caelum tanta clamoris alacritate compleverunt, ut certe constet
aves, quae supervolabant, attonitas paventesque decidisse.


Greece is liberated

After King Philip of Macedonia was conquered, when all of Greece
had gathered at the Isthmus spectacle, T. Quinctius Flamininus, at
a signal from the trumpet, ordered these words to be read aloud by
a herald: "The Roman Senate and People and Commander Titus
Quinctius Flamininus commands that all the cities of Greece that
were under the rule of King Philip are independent and free from
taxes."  And after they heard this, the people, overcome with
great and unexpected joy, were at first dumbstruck, as if not
believing what they had heard.  Then after the herald repeated the
proclamation they filled the sky with such a great clamor of
excitement that it is firmly held that the birds that were flying
overhead fell out of the sky, stunned and terrified.
