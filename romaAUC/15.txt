Graecia liberata

Philippo Macedoniae rege superato, cum ad Isthmicum spectaculum
tota Graecia convenisset, T. Quinctius Flamininus, tubae signo
silentio facto, per praeconem haec verba recitari iussit: "Senatus
Populusque Romanus et Titus Quinctius Flamininus imperator omnes
Graeciae urbes, quae sub dicione Philippi regis fuerunt, liberas
atque immunes esse iubet."  Quibus auditis, maximo et inopinato
gaudio homines perculsi primo, velut non audisse se quae audierant
credentes, obticuerunt.  Iterata deinde pronuntiatione praeconis,
caelum tanta clamoris alacritate compleverunt, ut certe constet
aves, quae supervolabant, attonitas paventesque decidisse.


Greece is liberated

After King Philip of Macedonia was conquered, when all of Greece
had gathered at the Isthmian games, T. Quinctius Flamininus, in the silence
caused by a signal from a trumpet, ordered these words to be read aloud by
a herald: "The Roman Senate and People and Commander Titus
Quinctius Flamininus commands that all the cities of Greece that
were under the rule of King Philip are independent and free from
taxes."  And after they heard this, the people, overcome with
great and unexpected joy, were at first dumbstruck, as if not
believing what they had heard.  Then after the herald repeated the
proclamation they filled the sky with such a great clamor of
excitement that it is firmly held that the birds that were flying
overhead fell out of the sky, stunned and terrified.


Paulli victoria et triumphus

Perses biennium tali fortuna cum consulibus Romanis conflixerat ut
plerumque superior fuerit magnamque partem Graeciae in societatem
suam perduceret.  Tum senatus populusque Romanus L. Aemilium
Paullum consulem iterum creavit.  Filius erat eius Paulli, qui ad
Cannas invitus perniciosam rei publicae pugnam inierat, fortiter
in ea mortem obierat.  Is Persam ingenti proelio apud urbem nomine
Pydnam in Macedonia devicit.  Ita Paullus maximum nobilissimumque
regem in triumpho duxit.

Paullo autem quattuor filii fuere; ex iis duos natu maiores, unum
P. Scipioni, Africani filio, in adoptionem dederat, alterum Fabio
Maximo.  Duos minores natu praetextatos, quo tempore victoriam
adeptus est, habuit.  Is, cum in contione extra urbem more maiorum
ante triumphi diem ordinem actorum suorum commemoraret, deos
immortalis precatus est, ut, si quis eorum invideret operibus ac
fortunae suae, in ipsum potius saeviret quam in rem publicam.
Quae vox, veluti oraculo emissa, magna parte eum spoliavit
sanguinis sui; nam alterum ex suis liberis quos in familia
retinuerat intra paucos dies ante triumphum, alterum paucioribus
post, amisit.


The victory and triumph of Paullus

For two years Perseus had clashed with the consuls of Rome with
such fortune that he generally prevailed, and induced a great part
of Greece into his alliance.  Then the Roman senate and people
made L. Aemilius Paullus consul again.  He was the son of the
Paullus who had reluctantly undertaken a hazardous battle for the
republic at Cannae and had bravely met his death in it.  He
defeated Perseus decisively in a huge battle at the city named
Pydna in Macedonia.  Thus Paullus led the greatest and most noble
king in his triumph.

Now Paullus had four sons.  He had given the two elder of these
into adoption, one to P. Scipio, the son of Scipio Africanus and
the other to Fabius Maximus.  He had two younger sons, who were
still underage when he gained the victory.  When, before the day
of the triumph, he gave an account of his deeds in an assembly
outside the City, according to the custom of our ancestors, he
prayed to the immortal gods that, if any of them begrudged him his
works and his fortune, they should vent their rage at him, rather
than on the republic.  And this voice, like one discharged by an
oracle, deprived him of a great part of his family; for he lost
one of his children whom he retained in his household a few days
before the triumph, and the other a few days after it.
