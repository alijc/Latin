A. Carthago Numantiaque a Scipione deletae

Eodem tempore statuit senatus Carthaginem exscindere.  Itaque
Publius Cornelius Scipio, naturalis consulis Aemilii Pauli filius,
adoptione Scipionis Africani Maioris nepos, aedilitatem petens,
consul creatus est.  Bellum Carthagini, iam biennio ante a
prioribus consulibus inlatum, maiore vi intulit; eamque urbem,
invisam Romanis magis invidia imperii quam ullius eius temporis
noxiae gratia, funditus sustulit.  Qua re fecit suae virtutis
monumentum, quod fuerat avi eius clementiae, et ipse Africanus
Minor appellatus est.

Deinde tredecim annis post, multis acceptis circa Numantiam
cladibus, Scipio, creatus iterum consul missusque in Hispaniam,
fortunae virtutique expertae in Africa respondit in Hispania, et
intra annum ac tres menses, circumdatam operibus Numantiam
excisamque aequavit solo.  Sic nomen suum perpetuae commendavit
memoriae; quippe, excisis Carthagine ac Numantia, ab alterius nos
metu, alterius vindicavit contumeliis.8


A. Carthage and Numantia wiped out by Scipio

At that time the senate decided to destroy Carthage.  And so
Publius Cornelius Scipio, the biological son of the consul Aemilius
Paulus, and the grandson by adoption of the elder Scipio Africanus,
sought an aedileship, but was made consul instead.  The war with
Carthage had already been waged for two years by the previous
consuls.  He came in with a greater force, and utterly destroyed the
city, which was detested by Rome more from envy of their rule than for the sake
of any crime of the time.  By this deed he turned a memorial of his
grandfather's mercy into one of his own worth, and was himself
called Africanus the younger.

Then thirteen years later, after many defeats were suffered around
Numantia, Scipio was again made consul and sent to Spain.  The
fortune that he'd experienced and the courage that he'd shown in
Africa were repeated in Spain, and within a year and three months,
after surrounding Numantia with siegeworks, he likewise razed the
city.  Thus he entrusted his name to everlasting memory; naturally,
with Carthage and Numantia destroyed.  He delivered us from the
first out of fear, and the other out of contumely.
