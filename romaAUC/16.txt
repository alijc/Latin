A. Carthago Numantiaque a Scipione deletae

Eodem tempore statuit senatus Carthaginem exscindere.  Itaque
Publius Cornelius Scipio, naturalis consulis Aemilii Pauli filius,
adoptione Scipionis Africani Maioris nepos, aedilitatem petens,
consul creatus est.  Bellum Carthagini, iam biennio ante a
prioribus consulibus inlatum, maiore vi intulit; eamque urbem,
invisam Romanis magis invidia imperii quam ullius eius temporis
noxiae gratia, funditus sustulit.  Qua re fecit suae virtutis
monumentum, quod fuerat avi eius clementiae, et ipse Africanus
Minor appellatus est.

Deinde tredecim annis post, multis acceptis circa Numantiam
cladibus, Scipio, creatus iterum consul missusque in Hispaniam,
fortunae virtutique expertae in Africa respondit in Hispania, et
intra annum ac tres menses, circumdatam operibus Numantiam
excisamque aequavit solo.  Sic nomen suum perpetuae commendavit
memoriae; quippe, excisis Carthagine ac Numantia, ab alterius nos
metu, alterius vindicavit contumeliis.8


A. Carthage and Numantia wiped out by Scipio

At that time the senate decided to destroy Carthage.  And so
Publius Cornelius Scipio, the biological son of the consul Aemilius
Paulus, and the grandson by adoption of the elder Scipio Africanus,
sought an aedileship, but was made consul instead.  The war with
Carthage had already been waged for two years by the previous
consuls.  He came in with a greater force, and utterly destroyed the
city, which was detested by Rome more from envy of their rule than for the sake
of any crime of the time.  By this deed he turned a memorial of his
grandfather's mercy into one of his own worth, and was himself
called Africanus the younger.

Then thirteen years later, after many defeats were suffered around
Numantia, Scipio was again made consul and sent to Spain.  The
fortune that he'd experienced and the courage that he'd shown in
Africa were repeated in Spain, and within a year and three months,
after surrounding Numantia with siegeworks, he likewise razed the
city.  Thus he entrusted his name to everlasting memory; naturally,
with Carthage and Numantia destroyed.  He delivered us from the
first out of fear, and the other out of contumely.


B. Scipionis virtus et humanitas

Quorum vero patres aut maiores aliqua gloria praestiterunt, ii
student plerumque eodem in genere laudis excellere, ut hic Paulli
filius, Africanus Minor, in re militari.  Quidam autem ad eas
laudes quas a patribus acceperunt, addunt aliquam suam, ut hic idem
Africanus eloquentia cumulavit bellicam gloriam.  Nam, vir omnibus
bonis artibus atque omni virtute praeditus, omnium aetatis suae
purissime locutus est.  Et certe non tulit ullos haec civitas aut
gloria clariores aut auctoritate graviores aut humanitate
politiores Publio Africano et amico eius Gaio Laelio, qui secum
eruditissimos homines ex Graecia palam semper habuerunt.  Scipio
enim tam elegans liberalium studiorum omnisque doctrinae et auctor
et admirator fuit ut Polybium Panaetiumque, praecellentis ingenio
viros, domi militiaeque secum habuerit.  Semper aut belli aut pacis
artibus serviit; semper inter arma ac studia versatus, aut corpus
periculis aut animum disciplinis exercuit.

Scipio's character and nature

Truly, of those whose fathers or ancestors excelled in any
particular glory, they strive to excel mostly in the same way in a
sort of renown, as does this son of Paullius, Africanus the
younger, in military affairs.  But some added their own renown to
what they received from their fathers, as this same Africanus
accumulated military glory with his eloquence.  For, a man gifted
with every good quality and virtue, of all the men of his
generation he spoke most clearly.  And surely this city hasn't
produced anyone either brighter in glory, or more serious in
judgment, or more refined in courtesy then Publius Africanus and
his friend Gaius Laelius, who have always openly held themselves to
be the best educated men from Greece.  For Scipio was so elegant an
patron and admirer of liberal studies and of all learning, that he
kept Polybius and Panaetius, distinguished men by nature, with him,
both at home and in the field.  He always served the arts of either
of war or of peace, always shifting between arms and his studies;
he either trained his body with danger, or his mind with learning.
