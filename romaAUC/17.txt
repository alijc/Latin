Rei publicae Romanae vitia

The defects of the Roman republic


A. Igitur ante bella Punica domi militiaeque boni mores colebantur;
concordia maxima, minim avaritia erat; ius bonumque apud eos non
legibus magis quam natura valebat.  Iurgia, discordias, simultates
cum hostibus exercebant, cives cum civibus de virtute certabant.
In suppliciis deorum magnifici, domi parci, in amicos fideles
erant.  Duabus his artibus, audacia in bello, ubi pax evenerat
aequitate, seque remque publicam curabant.

Sed ubi labore atque iustitia res publica crevit, reges magni bello
domiti, nationes ferae et populi ingentes vi subacti, Carthago
aemula imperi Romani, ab stirpe interiit, cuncta maria terraeque
patebant, saevire fortuna ac miscere omnia coepit.  Qui labores,
pericula, dubias atque asperas res facile toleraverant, eis otium,
divitiae, optanda alias, oneri miseriaeque fuere.  Igitur primo
imperi, deinde pecuniae cupido crevit; ea quasi materies omnium
malorum fuere.  Namque avaritia fidem, probitatem, ceterasque artis
bonas subvertit; pro his superbiam, crudelitatem, deos neglegere,
omnia venalia habere edocuit.  Haec primo paulatim crescere,
interdum vindicari; post, ubi contagio quasi pestilentia invasit,
civitas immutata, imperium ex iustissimo atque optimo crudele
intolerandumque factum.


And so good character was honored in war and peace before the Punic
Wars; there was the greatest harmony, and the least avarice;
justice and good prevailed there not so much from laws as from
nature.  They carried out quarrels, disagreements, and enmities
with their enemies, while citizens vied in virtue with their fellow
citizens.  They were magnificant in their supplications of the
gods, sparing at home, and faithful to their friends.  With both of
these arts, boldness in war, and justice in times of peace, they
took care of both themselves and the republic.

But when the republic thrived through labor and justice, great
kings were conquered in war, savage nations and unnatural peoples
were subjugated by force, Carthage, a rival of Roman power,
utterly perished, all the seas and lands lay open, fortune began to
rage and to throw everything into confusion.  Those who had endured
toils, dangers, and uncertain and rough affairs with ease, for them leisure
and riches were, on the contrary, a burden and a misery.  And so
the desire, first for power, and then for money, increased.
These were like the substance of all evils.  Indeed, avarice subverted
faith, honesty, and the rest of the noble arts; instead of these it
taught arrogance, cruelty, neglect of the gods, and putting a price
on everything.  At first these increased little by little, and
were occasionally punished; later, when the infection invaded
like a plague, the city was altered, and the state, once the fairest
and noblest, became cruel and unbearable.


B. Potentiae Romanorum prior Scipio viam aperuerat, luxuriae
posterior aperuit.  Quippe, remoto Carthaginis metu, sublataque
imperii aemula, non gradu sed praecipiti cursu a virtute descitum
est, ad vitia transcursum.  Vetus disciplina deserta, nova inducta;
in somnum a vigiliis, ab armis ad voluptates, a negotiis in otium
conversa civitas.

The elder Scipio had revealed the path to Roman power, the younger
one revealed the way to extravagance.  Naturally, with the fear of
Carthage removed and their rival to power destroyed, they deserted
virtue and crossed over to vices, not gradually but head-over-heels.
The ancient training was abandoned, and the new way introduced; The
city converted from wakefulness to sleep, from arms to pleasure,
from work to leisure.


C. Vetus ac iam pridem insita mortalibus potentiae cupido cum imperii
magnitudine adolevit erupitque.
Nam rebus modicis aequalitas facile habebatur 
sed ubi, subacto orbe et aemulis urbibus regibusve excisis,
securas opes concupiscere vacuum fuit,
prima inter patres plebemque certamina exarsere.
Modo turbulenti tribuni, modo consules praevalidi,24
et in urbe ac foro temptamenta civilium bellorum.


The ancient lust for power, long since implanted in mortals,
increased and erupted along with the magnitude of their rule.
For equality was easily held to in moderate circumstances,
but when, after the world was subjugated and rival cites or kings
destroyed, it was possible to covet undisturbed wealth,
and for the first struggles between fathers and the common people to flare up.
Sometimes there were riotous tribunes, and sometimes powerful consuls,
and in the city and forum were the trials of civil wars.
