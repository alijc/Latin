Tiberii Gracchi vita et mors

Tiberius Gracchus, Tiberii Gracchi clarissimi atque eminentissimi
viri filius, P. Africani ex filia nepos, tribunus plebis creatus est.
Vir erat vita innocentissimus, ingenio florentissimus, proposito
sanctissimus, tantis denique adornatus virtutibus, quantas mortalis
condicio recipit.  P. Mucio Scaevola L. Calpurnio consulibus,
descivit a bonis; promulgatisque agrariis legibus, summa imis miscuit
et in praeruptum atque anceps periculum adduxit rem publicam.
Octavioque collegae pro bono publico rogationi intercedenti
tribunatum abrogavit.  Tunc triumviros agris dividendis coloniisque
deducendis creavit se socerumque suum, consularem Appium, et Gaium
fratrem admodum iuvenem.

Deinde senatus a consule Mucio Scaevola convocatus censuit ut consul
armis rem publicam tueretur, sed Scaevola negavit se quicquam vi esse
acturum.  At P. Scipio Nasica, pontifex maximus, cum esset
consobrinus Ti. Gracchi, patriam cognationi praeferens, omnes
hortatus est, qui salvum esse vellent rem publicam, ut se
sequerentur.  Tum optimates, senatus atque equestris ordinis pars
melior et maior, et intacta perniciosis consiliis plebs inruere in
Gracchum stantem in area Capitolii cum catervis suis.  Is, fugiens
decurrensque clivo Capitolino, fragmine subsellii ictus, vitam, quam
gloriosissime degere potuerat, immatura morte finivit.  Postea Scipio
Aemilianus a tribuno Carbone interrogatus quid de Ti. Gracchi caede
sentiret, respondit si is occupandae rei publicae animum habuisset,
iure caesum.  Nihilominus hoc initium in urbe Roma civilis sanguinis
gladiorumque impunitatis fuit.


The life and death of Tiberius Gracchus

Tiberius Gracchus, the son of the renowned and eminent man Tiberius
Gracchus and the grandson of P. Africanus by way of his daughter, was
made tribune of the plebs.  The man was virtuous in life, shining in
nature, pious in conduct, and finally as well endowed in courage as
is permitted to mortals.  He deserted the conservatives during the
consulship of P. Mucius Scaevola and L. Calpurnius, and, pushing
through agrarian laws, turned everything topsy turvy and led the
republic into a precipitous and doubtful danger.  Intervening, for
the public good, against a proposed law, he stripped the office of
tribune from his colleague Octavius.  Then he created a triumvirate
for dividing properties and settling colonies - himself, his
father-in-law, the former consul Appius, and his brother Gaius, even
though he was very young.

Then the senate convened by the consul Mucius Scaevola, resolved that
the consul could protect the republic with arms, but Scaevola said
that he wouldn't resort to force.  But P. Scipio Nasica, the high
priest, giving preference to his country over his kin, despite being
Ti. Gracchus' cousin, urged everyone who wanted the republic to be
safe to follow him.  Then the aristicrats, the senate and the better
and greater part of the equestrian class, along with those plebs who
hadn't been tainted by his pernicious plans, rushed Gracchus, who was
standing in the open space of the Capitoline Hill with his entourage.
He, fleeing and running down by way of the Capitaline slope, was
struck by a chunk of a bench, which put an end, with an untimely
death, to the life that he could have lived in glory.  Afterwards
Scipio Aemilianus, when asked by the tribune Carbonus what he thought
about the slaughter of Ti. Gracchus, he replied if he had intended to
seize the republic, then his killing was lawful.  Nevertheless this
was the beginning of civil bloodshed and unpunished murder in the
city of Rome.
