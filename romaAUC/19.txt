Gaii Gracchi tribunatus et exitus

Decem deinde interpositis annis, qui Ti. Gracchum, idem Gaium
fratrem eius occupavit furor, tam virtutibus eius omnibus quam
huic errori similem, ingenio etiam eloquentiaque longe
praestantiorem.  Qui cum, summa quiete animi, civitatis princeps
esse posset, vel vindicandae fraternae mortis gratia vel
praemuniendae regalis potentiae, eiusdem exempli tribunatum
ingressus est.  Sed longe maiora et acriora petens, dabat
civitatem omnibus Italicis, dividebat agros, novis coloniis
replebat provincias, iudicia a senatu transferebat ad equites,
frumentum plebi dari instituebat.  Nihil immotum, nihil
tranquillum, nihil quietum, nihil denique in eodem statu
relinquebat; quin alterum etiam continuavit tribunatum.

Hunc L. Opimius consul, persecutus armis, morte adfecit.  Nam
Gracchus profugiens, cum iam comprehenderetur ab iis, quos
Opimius miserat, cervicem Euporo servo praebuit, qui non segnius
se ipse interemit quam domino succurrerat.  Ut Ti. Gracchi antea
corpus, ita Gaii, mira crudelitate victorum, in Tiberim deiectum
est; crudelesque mox quaestiones in amicos clientesque Gracchorum
habitae sunt.

Hunc Ti. Gracchi liberi, P. Scipionis Africani nepotes, viva
adhuc matre Cornelia, Africani filia, viri optimis ingeniis male
usi, vitae mortisque habuere exitum.  Qui si civilem dignitatis
concupissent modum, quidquid tumultuando adipisci gestierunt,
quietis obtulisset res publica.


The tribuneship and death of Gaius Gracchus

Ten years later, the same madness that had seized Tiberius
Gracchus also caught his brother Gaius.  He was like his brother
in both his virtues and his error, but his error was far
outstripped by his cleverness and eloquence.  And although he
could have been, with the utmost peace of mind, the leader of the
city, either from vindicating his brother's death or fortifying
the royal power, he entered into the same sort of tribuneship as
his brother had.  But he sought far greater and bitterer things,
trying to give citizenship to all Italians, breaking up farms,
filling the provinces with new colonies, transferring the legal
process from the senate to the equestrian class, and arranging
for grain to be given to the common people.  He sought to leave
nothing unchanged, nothing calm, nothing peaceful, and finally,
nothing in its former condition; and yet he continued as a
tribune for a second term.

The consul L. Optimis, accomplished in arms, afflicted this man
with death.  For when Gracchus was in flight, and about to be
captured by those whom Optimis had sent, he stretched out his
neck to his slave Euporus, who was as quick to kill himself as he
had aided his master.  As before, the corpse of Gaius, like that
of Ti. Gracchus, was thrown into the Tiber, through the
extraordiny barbarity of the victors.  And soon harsh
investigations against the friends and clients of the Gracchi
were held.

Ti. Gracchus' children, the grandsons of P. Scipio Africanus by
their still-living mother, Cornelia, Africanus' daughter, these
ill-used men of good nature, had this sort of exit of life and
death.  Whoever desired a civil manner of dignity, whatever they
were eager to secure through an armed uprising, the republic
would have bestowed in peace time.
