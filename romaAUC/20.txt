A. Ciceronis de Gracchis sententia

Tiberius Gracchus, Publi filius et Tiberi Gaique pater, tam diu
laudabitur dum memoria rerum Romanarum manebit.  At eius filli
nec vivi probabantur a bonis, et mortui numerum obtinent iure
caesorum.  Tiberius enim convellit statum civitatis; sed qua
gravitate vir! qua eloquentia! qua dignitate!  Nihil ut a patris
avique Africani praestabili insignique virtute, praeterquam quod
a senatu desciverat, deflexisset.  Secutus est Gaius; quo
ingenio! quanta vi! quanta gravitate dicendi!  Ut dolerent boni
non illa tanta ornamenta ad meliorem mentem voluntatemque esse
conversa.

Hi duo clarissimi, ingeniosissimi, amantissimi plebis Romanae
viri plebem in agris publicis constituere conati sunt, qui agri a
privatis antea possidebantur.  Nam agrariam Tiberius legem
ferebat.  Grata erat populo; fortunae constitui tenuiorum
videbantur.  Nitebantur contra optimates, quod et discordiam
excitari videbant et, cum locupletes possessionibus diuturnis
moverentur, spoliari rem publicam propugnatoribus arbitrabantur.
Postea frumentariam legem Gaius ferebat; iucunda res plebi;
victus enim suppeditabatur large sine labore.  Repugnabant boni,
quod et ab industria plebem ad desidiam avocari putabant et
aerarium exhauriri videbant.


A. Cicero's opinion on the Gracchi

Tiberius Gracchus, the son of Publius and the father of Tiberius
and Gaius, will be praised as long as the memory of Roman affairs
remains.  But his sons, alive, were not approved of by honest
men, and, dead, were numbered among those justly killed.  For
Tiberius shattered the conditions of the city; but what gravitas
he had! what eloquence! what dignity!  Would that he had not
turned aside from his father's and his grandfather Africanus'
distinguished and eminent character, and stayed true to the
senate.  Gaius followed in his tracks; what a nature we must
declare for him! what strength! what gravitas!  Which causes good
men to grieve that such adornments were not turned to better a
mind and purpose.

This pair of men, illustrious, talented and beloved by the common
people of Rome, attempted to dispose commoners on state-owned
farms, farms that had previously been seized by private citizens.
For Tiberius was trying to pass laws in agrarian reform, which
was welcome to the people, for their fortunes seemed to be made
of rather poor stuff.  The aristocrats strove against the laws,
both because they thought that it would stir up discord and,
since wealthy men would be removed from the property that they'd
long held, they believed that the republic would be despoiled by
its champions.  Later, Gaius tried to pass a grain law; an
agreeable thing for the common people; for food was supplied
largely without labor.  Honest men opposed this, because they
thought that the common people would be diverted from industry to
idleness and that the treasury would be exhausted.


B. Sallustii de Gracchis sententia

Ubi primum ex nobilitate reperti sunt, qui veram gloriam iniustae
potentiae anteponerent, moveri civitas et dissensio civilis,
quasi permixtio terrae, oriri coepit.  Nam postquam Ti. et
C. Gracchus, quorum maiores Punico atque aliis bellis multum rei
publicae addiderant, vindicare plebem in libertatem et paucorum
scelera patefacere coepere, nobilitas — noxia atque eo perculsa —
Gracchorum actionibus obviam iit; et primo Tiberium, dein paucos
post annos eadem ingredientem Gaium ferro necavit.  Et sane
Gracchis cupidine victoriae haud satis moderatus animus fuit.
Sed bono vinci satius est quam malo more iniuriam ulcisci.17


B. Sallust's opinion on the Gracchi

When it was first found that some of the nobility preferred true
glory over unjust power, it began to emerge that the citizens and
civil dissension were stirred up, just like an earthquake.  For
after Ti. and C. Gracchus, whose ancestors had added much to the
republic in the Punic and other wars, began to set the common
people at liberty and to expose the crimes of the nobles, the
nobility - guilty, and for that reason in a panic - went against
the actions of the Gracchi.  And they put Tiberius to the sword
first, then after a few years, Gaius, who'd proceeded in the same
way.  The Gracchi had an unreasonable desire for victory, and
insuffiently restrained spirits.  But it is better for a good man
to be overcome than for a bad man to disturb in a manner to
avenge an injury.
