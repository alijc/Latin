Marii consulatus multiplicati

Iugurtha Sullae vinctus traditur, et ab eo ad Marium deductus est.
Per idem tempus adversum Gallos ab ducibus nostris, Q. Caepione et
Cn. Manlio, male pugnatum.  Itaque metu Italia omnis contremuit.
Nam usque ad nostram memoriam Romani sic habuere alia omnia
virtuti suae prona esse, se cum Gallis pro salute, non pro gloria,
certare.  Sed postquam bellum in Numidia confectum esse et
Iugurtham Romam Vinctum adduci nuntiatum est, Marius consul absens
factus est, et ei decreta provincia Gallia.  Isque Kalendis
Ianuariis magna gloria consul triumphavit.  Et ea tempestate spes
atque opes civitatis in illo sitae.

Nam cum Germanae gentes, quibus nomen Cimbris ac Teutonis erat,
complures consules fudissent fugassentque atque multos celeberrimi
nominis viros trucidassent, populus Romanus non alium repellendis
tantis hostibus magis idoneum imperatorem quam Marium ratus est.
Tum multiplicati consulatus eius.  Tertius in apparatu belli
consumptus; quarto trans Alpis circa Aquas Sextias cum Teutonis
conflixit; quinto citra Alpis ad Vercellas in campis, quibus nomen
erat Raudiis, ipse consul et proconsul Q. Lutatius Catulus
fortunatissimo decertavere proelio; caesa aut capta amplius centum
milia hominum.  Hac victoria videtur meruisse Marius, ne eius nati
rem publicam paeniteret, ac mala bonis repensasse.  Sextus
consulatus veluti praemium ei meritorum datus, quo Servilii
Glauciae Saturninique Apuleii furorem, rem publicam lacerantium
atque gladiis et caede comitia discutientium, consul armis
compescuit, hominesque exitiabilis morte multavit.


The multiple consulships of Marius

Jugurtha was handed over to Sulla in chains, and passed from him
to Marius.  Meanwhile the fight against the Gauls by our leaders,
Quintus Caepio and Gnaus Manlius, was going badly.  And so all
Italy trembled with dread.  For throughout our memory the Romans
have so held that everything else bends to their own might, that they
fought with the Gauls for safety, not for glory.  But after it
was reported that the war in Numidia was successfully concluded
and Jugurtha was led to Rome in chains, Marius was made consul,
even though he wasn't in Rome, and the province of Gaul was
settled on him.  And he celebrated his triumph, as consul, on
January 1, with great glory.  And in this crisis, the hope and
resources of the citizens rested with him.

For after the German tribes that were called the Cimberi and the
Teutoni had routed and put to flight a number of consuls and had
slaughtered many men of renowned name, the Roman people reckoned
that there was no other general more able to repel such an enemy
than Marius.  Then his consulship was repeated.  The third was
taken up in preparing for war; during the fourth he fought against
the Teutoni on the other side of the Alps near Aix-en-Provence; in
the fifth on this side of the Alps at Vercellae on the Raudine
plains; he, as consul, and proconsul Q. Lutatius Catulus fought a
fortuitous battle, with more than a hundred thousand men cut down
or captured.  By this victory Marius seemed to have earned the
right for the republic to not regret his birth, and for his evil
deeds to be counterbalanced by these good ones.  His sixth
consulship was granted him as if a reward for what was due him,
during which the consul resorted to arms to check the frenzy of
Servilius Glaucia and Saturninius Apuleius, who had slashed at the
republic with swords and shaken the Comitia with bloodshed, and
he punished death-dealing men with death.
