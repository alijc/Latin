Bellum Sociale vel Italicum

Sociale bellum vocetur licet, ut extenuemus invidiam, si verum
tamen volumus, illud civile bellum fuit.  Quippe cum populus
Romanus Etruscos et Latinos Sabinosque sibi miscuerit, corpus
fecit ex membris et ex omnibus unus est.  Itaque cum ius
civitatis, quam viribus auxerant, socii iustissime postularent,
quam in spem eos cupidine dominationis Drusus erexerat,
postquam ille domestico scelere oppressus est, eadem fax, quae
illum cremavit, socios in arma et expugnationem urbis accendit.
Quid hac clade tristius? Quid calamitosius?
Quippe, L. Caesare et P. Rutilio consulibus, abhinc annos
centum viginti, universa Italia arma adversus Romanos cepit.
Quorum ut fortuna atrox, ita causa fuit iustissima; petebant
enim eam civitatem, cuius imperium armis tuebantur.  Id bellum
amplius trecenta milia iuventutis Italicae abstulit.
Clarissimi autem imperatores fuerunt Romani eo bello
Cn. Pompeius, Cn. Pompeii Magni pater; C. Marius, de quo
praediximus; L. Sulla, anno anto praetura functus; Q. Metellus,
Numidici filius, qui meritum cognomen Pii consecutus erat.

Tam varia atque atrox fortuna Italici belli fuit,
ut per biennium continuum duo Romani consules,
Rutilius ac deinde Cato Porcius, ab hostibus occiderentur,
exercitus populi Romani multis in locis funderentur,
utque ad saga iretur diuque in eo habitu maneretur.
Paulatim deinde,
recipiendo in civitatem qui arma non ceperant aut deposuerant maturius,
vires refectae sunt,
Pompeio Sullaque et Mario fluentem
procumbentemque rem populi Romani restituentibus.


The Social, or Italian, War

Although it may be called the Social War, to let us lessen the
ill will, nevertheless, if the truth be told, that war was a
civil war.  Of course, when the Roman people joined with
the Etruscans and the Sabines, they made a single body from all
the limbs.  And so the allies quite rightly demanded the rights
of citizenship, seeing that they had increased the state with
their strength.  Drusus had roused them to that hope with a
desire for dominion, and after he was done in in a personal
crime, the same torch that lit his funeral pyre kindled the
allies to arms and to attack the City.  What was more sorrowful
than this disaster?  What was more ruinous?

Of course, in the time of the consuls L. Caesar and P. Rutillo,
a hundred and twenty years ago, all of Italy took up arms
against the Romans.  Despite their dreadful fortune, their
cause was justified; for they were asking for citizenship of
the state that they had protected with arms.  That war carried
off more than three hundred thousand young men of Italy.
Now the most illustrious Roman generals in that war were
Cn. Pompey, the father of Cn. Pompey the Great; C. Marius, whom
we've written about already; L. Sulla, in the year before he
held the praetorship; Q. Metellus, the son of Numidius, who
earned the well-deserved epithet of Pius.

The fortune of the Italian War was so changeable and bloody,
that in two consecutive years two Roman consuls, Rutilius and
then Cato Porcius, were killed by the enemy, the armies of the
Roman people were routed in many places, and the country went
to war and endured in that condition for a long time.  Little
by little then, as those who not had taken up arms, or had laid
them down fairly early, withdrew into the city, their forces
were rebuilt, restoring the fluid and sinking affair of the
Roman people to Pompey and Sulla and Marius.
