Marii at Cinnae dominatio

Non erat Mario Sulpicioque Cinna temperantior.  Itaque cum ita
civitas Italiae data esset, ut in octo tribus contribuerentur novi
cives, ne potentias eorum et multitudo veterum civium dignitatem
frangeret, Cinna in omnibus tribubus eos se distributurum pollicitus
est.  Qua de causa ex urbe pulsus est collegae optimatiumque
viribus, et ex auctoritate senatus consulatus ei abrogatus est.  Tum
Cinna, retinens insignia consulatus, patriae bellum intulit, fretus
ingenti numero novorum civium, e quibius amplius trecentas cohortes
conscripserat.  Opus erat partibus auctoritate, cuius augendae
gratia C. Marium cum filio de exsilio revocavit.

Rediit ab Africa Marius clade maior, si quidem carcer,
catenae, fuga, exsilium horrificaverant dignitatem.
Itaque ad nomen tanti viri late concurritur,
et facile invenit exercitum imperator.
Nihil vero illa Marii victoria fuisset crudelius,
nisi mox Sullana esset secuta.

Non modo mediocres verum excelsissimi atque eminentissimi civitatis viri
variis suppliciorum generibus adfecti sunt.
In iis consul Octavius, vir lenissimi animi, iussu Cinnae interfectus est.
M. Antonius, princeps civitatis atque eloquentiae,
gladiis militum iussu Marii Cinnaeque confossus est.
Q. Catulus, cum ad mortem conquireretur,
conclusit se loco nuper calce harenaque perpolito,
inlatoque igni, qui vim odoris excitaret,
simul exitiali hausto spiritu, simul incluso suo mortem obiit.
Omnia erant praecipitia in re publica.

Secundum deinde consulatum Cinna et septimum Marius,
in priorum dedecus, iniit,
cuius initio morbo oppressus decessit - vir in bello hostibus,
in otio civibus infectissimus quietisque impatientissimus.
Dominante in Italia Cinna,
maior pars nobilitatis ad Sullam in Achaiam ac deinde post in Asiam perfugit.
Antequam Sulla, compositis transmarinis rebus, in Italiam rediret,
Cinna, seditione orta, ab exercitu interemptus est -
vir dignior qui arbitrio victorum moreretur quam iracundia militum.16


The rule of Marius and Cinna

Cinna was not more restrained than Marius and Sulpicius.  And so
although citizenship had been so granted to Italy on the
understanding that the new citizens be incorporated into eight
tribes, to keep their political power and great numbers from
overwhelming the eminence of the original citizens, Cinna promised
to distribute them into all of the tribes.  For this reason he was
driven out of the city by his colleagues and the optimates, and his
consulship was revoked by the authority of the senate.  Then Cinna,
holding onto the insignia of the consulship, brought war upon his
native land, supported by the huge number of new citizens, from
which he'd raised more than three hundred cohorts.  His party was in
need of authority, so for sake of increasing it he called C. Marius
and his son back from exile.

Marius returned from Africa made greater by his defeat, as if
prison, chains, flight, and exile had made his standing more
awesome.  And so, far and wide, they flocked to the name of such a
man, and the general found an army with no difficulty.  Indeed
nothing could have been crueler than Marius' victory, except for
Sulla's, which would follow soon after.

Not only the commoners, but in truth the most noble and
distinguished men of the state were afflicted with varying torments.
Among these the consul Octavius, a man of the gentlest soul, was
killed by the order of Cinna.  M. Antonius, foremost of citizenship
and eloquence, was run through with the soldiers' swords by order of
Marius and Cinna.  When Q. Catulus was being hunted down, marked for
death, he shut himself up in a room that had just been plastered,
carrying in a fire, to increase the power of the odor, and first
breathing in the deadly fumes, then stopping up his own breath, he
met his death.  Everything in the republic was precarious.

Then Cinna and Marius entered into the consulship.  It was the
seventh for Marius, to the disgrace of his previous ones.  From the
start he waned, pressed down by illness - a man at war to his
enemies, at peace most corrupt to the citizens and most intolerant
of calm.  With Cinna in control of Italy, most of the nobles fled to
Sulla in Achaia and then afterwards to Asia.  Before Sulla could
arranged the affairs overseas and return to Italy, a rebellion
sprang up there and Cinna was done away with by the army.  It would
have been more meet for the man to die by the decision of his
conquerors than by the resentment of his soldiers.
