Sullana victoria et dictatura

Putares Sullam venisse in Italiam non belli vindicem sed pacis
auctorem: tanta cum quiete exercitum per Calariam Apuliamque cum
singulari cura frugum, agrorum, hominum, urbium perduxit in
Campaniam; temptavitque iustis legibus et aequis condicionibus bellum
componere.  Sed iis, quibus pessima et immodica cupiditas erat, non
poterat pax placere.  Crescebat interim in dies Sullae exercitus,
confluentibus ad eum optimo quoque et sanissimo.  Felici deinde circa
Capuam eventu Scipionem Norbanumque consules superavit, quorum
Norbanus acie victus; Scipio, ab exercitu suo desertus ac proditus,
inviolatus a Sulla dimissus est.  Adeo enim Sulla dissimilis fuit
bellator ac victor, ut, dum vincit mitis ac lenis, post victoriam
fuerit crudelissimus.  Nam et consulem, ut praediximus, exarmatum
Quintumque Sertorium (pro quanti mox belli facem!)  et multos alios,
potitus eorum, dimisit incolumis, credo, ut in eodem homine duplicis
ac diversissimi animi conspiceretur exemplum.

Occiso demum Mario Marii filio, Felicis nomen Sulla, adsumpsit, quod
quidem usurpasset iustissime, si eundem et vincendi et vivendi finem
habuisset.  Nam videbantur finita belli civilis mala, cum Sullae
crudelitate aucta sunt.  Quippe dictator creatus, imperio quo
priores ad vindicandam maximis periculis rem publicam olim usi
erant, eo in immodicae crudelitatis licentiam usus est.  Primus ille
(et utinam ultimus) exemplum proscriptionis invenit.  Nec tantum in
eos, qui contra arma tulerant, sed in multos insontis saevitum.
Adiectum etiam, ut bona proscriptorum venirent exclusique paternis
opibus liberi etiam petendorum honorum iure prohiberentur.


Sulla's victory and dictatorship

You may have thought that Sulla had come to Italy not as a champion
of war but as a supporter of peace: so peacefully did he lead his army
though Calaria and Apulia, with remarkable care for the crops, the
fields, the men, the cities in Campania; and he tried to settle the
war with just laws and fair agreements.  But peace could not satisfy
those with the worst and most immoderate greed.  Meanwhile Sulla's
army increased day by day, because the best and most reasonable men
flocked to him.  Then, near Capua, he defeated the consuls Scipio and
Norbanus by sheer luck, of these Norbanus was defeated in battle;
Scipio, deserted and betrayed by his army, was released, unharmed,
by Sulla.  For indeed Sulla was unlike a warrior or victor, that while
he was meek and gentle until he won, he was very cruel after his
victory.  For he even sent away, unharmed, as we said before, the
disarmed consul Quintus Sertorius (alas, soon to be the torch of such
a war!)  and many others, after he captured them so that, I suppose,
he'd appear as an example of a divided and opposing soul in the same
man.

Finally, when Marius the younger was killed, Sulla assumed the name
of Felix, which he would have been more justified in using, had he
only come to his victory and the end of his life at the same time.
For the evils of the civil war seemed to be ending, until they were
increased by Sulla's cruelty.  For you see, after he was made
dictator, the power that his predessors had once used to deliver the
republic from its greatest perils, was used by him to plunge it into
the chaos of excessive barbarity.  The first thing he did (and would
that it were the last) was to create a pattern of proscription.  He
raged, not only against those who bore arms against him, but against
many innocent men.  In addition, the goods of the proscribed people
were sold, and their children too, excluded from their father's
wealth, were also enjoined from the right of asking for their
offices.
