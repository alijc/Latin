Ciceronis de Mario, Cinna, et Sulla duae sententiae

A. Neque enim ullus alius discordiarum solet esse exitus inter
claros et potentes viros nisi aut universus interitus aut
victoris dominatus vel regnum. Dissensit cum Mario, clarissimo
cive, consul nobilissimus et fortissimus, L. Sulla; horum
uterque ita cecidit victus, ut victor idem regnaverit. Cum
Octavio collega Cinna dissedit; utrique horum secunda fortuna
regnum est largita, adversa mortem. Idem iterum Sulla
superavit; tum sine dubio habuit regalem potestatem, quamquam
rem publicam recuperarat.

B. Etenim recordamini, Quirites, omnis civilis dissensiones, non
solum eas quas audistis sed eas quas vosmet ipsi meministis atque
vidistis. L. Sulla P. Sulpicium oppressit; eiecit ex urbe
C. Marium, custodem huius urbis, multosque fortes viros partim
eiecit ex civitate, partim interemit.  Cn. Octavius consul armis
ex urbe expulit collegam; omnis hic locus acervis corporum et
civium sanguine redundavit.  Superavit postea Cinna cum Mario;
tum vero, clarissimis viris interfectis, lumina civitatis
extincta sunt.  Ultus est huius victoriae crudelitatem postea
Sulla â€” ne dici quidem opus est quanta deminutione civium et
quanta calamitate rei publicae.  L. Cinna crudelis, C. Marius in
iracundia perseverans, L. Sulla vehemens; atque quid eorum
victoria crudelius, quid funestius?


Two opinions of Cicero on Marius, Cinna, and Sulla

A. For disagreements between famous and powerful men are wont to
end in nothing except either universal destruction or the tyrany
or rule of a victor.  Sulla, the noble and powerful consul,
disagreed with Marius, the illustrious citizen; each of them was
thus conquered and toppled, for the other to rule as victor.
Cinna disagreed with his colleague Octavius; to each of them
favorable fortune granted a kingdom, and adverse fortune - death.
The same Sulla was again victorious; then without doubt he had the
power of a king, even though he had restored the republic.

B.  And indeed, Romans, keep all the civil dissensions in mind,
not just the ones that you heard about, but also those that you
yourselves paid attention to and considered.  L. Sulla overthrew
P. Sulpicius; he drove C. Marius, the city's guardian, out of the
city; he drove out many strong men and killed others.  The consul
Cn. Octavius drove his colleague from the city by force; this
very spot overflowed with piles of corpses and the blood of our
fellow citizens.  After that, Cinna had the upper hand with with
Marius; then truly, after the most illustrious men were killed,
the lights of the city were quenched.  And then Sulla avenged the
barbarity of that victory - there is no need either to say how
great was the loss to the citizens and how great a disaster to
the republic.  Hard-harded L. Cinna, long-raging C. Marius,
severe L. Sulla; and what is crueler than their victory, was is
more deadly?
