Pompeius, imperator eximius, praedones superat

Quis igitur hoc homine scientior umquam aut fuit aut esse debuit?
Qui saepius cum hoste conflixit quam quisquam cum inimico
concertavit, plura bella gessit quam ceteri legerunt, plures
provincias confecit quam alii concupiverunt.  Cuius adulescentia
ad scientiam rei militaris non alienis praeceptis sed suis
imperiis, non offensionibus belli sed victoriis, non stipendiis
sed triumphis est erudita.  Quod denique genus esse belli potest,
in quo illum non exercuerit fortuna rei publicae?  Civile
Africanum, Transalpinum, Hispaniense, servile, navale bellum,
varia et diversa genera et bellorum et hostium non solum gesta ab
hoc uno sed etiam confecta nullam rem esse declarant in usu
positam militari, quae huius viri scientiam fugere possit.

Testes vero virtutum eius imperatoriarum iam omnes sunt orae
atque omnes exterae gentes ac nationes, denique maria omnia,
omnes sinus atque portus.  Quis enim toto mari locus per hos
annos aut tam firmum habuit praesidium ut tutus esset, aut tam
fuit abditus ut lateret?  Quis navigavit qui non se aut mortis
aut servitutis periculo committeret, cum aut hieme aut referto
praedonum mari navigaret?  Quam provinciam tenuistis a
praedonibus liberam per hosce annos?  Quod vectigal vobis tutum
fuit? Quem socium defendistis?  Cui praesidio classibus vestris
fuistis?

Tum unius hominis incredibilis ac divina virtus brevi tempore
lucem rei publicae attulit.  Atque haec qua celeritate gesta
sint, quamquam videtis, tamen a me in dicendo praetereunda non
sunt.  Cn. Pompeius, nondum tempestivo ad navigandum mari,
Siciliam adiit, Africam exploravit, in Sardiniam cum classe
venit, atque haec tria frumentaria subsidia rei publicae
firmissimis praesidiis classibusque munivit.  Omnes qui ubique
praedones fuerunt partim capti interfectique sunt, partim unius
huius se imperio ac potestati dediderunt.  Ita tantum bellum, tam
diuturnum, tam longe lateque dispersum, quo bello omnes gentes ac
nationes premebantur, Cn. Pompeius extrema hieme apparavit,
ineunte vere suscepit, media aestate confecit.



Pompey, an extraordinary commander, conquers the pirates

So, who was ever more skillful than this man, or should have been?
He who clashed with the state's enemies more often than anyone
fought with a personal one, waged more wars than other men have
read about and subdued and established more provinces than other men
coveted.  Whose youth was educated in the skill of military
affairs, not by the lessons of others but by commands of his own,
not by the misfortunes of war but by victories, not by campaigns
but by triumphs.  Finally, what sort of war can there be in which
the fortune of the republic did not train him.  The Civil, the
African, the Transalpine, the Spanish, the slave and naval wars,
various and diverse sorts of both wars and enemies, not only waged
but even brought to completion by this man alone, declare that
there is nothing that lies in the military realm that can escape
this man's skill.

Indeed, even now the witnesses of his powers of command are all
the coasts and all the foreign tribes and nations, and then all
the seas, all the bays and harbors.  For during these years, what
spot in the entire sea either had a strong enough defense to
protect it or was hidden enough to escape notice?  Did not
whoever sailed, either in winter or in a sea filled with pirates,
entrust himself to the danger of either death or slavery?  Did
you keep this province free from pirates during these years?
What tribute protected you?  Which ally did you defend?  For
whose protection were you with your fleets?

Then the courage of a single extraordinary and godlike man
shortly brought safety to the republic.  And these things,
speedily accomplished, although you see them, nevertheless must
not be neglected by me in speaking.  Before the sea was calm
enough to sail on, Cn. Pompey attacked Sicily, reconnoitered
Africa, and came to Sardinia with a fleet, and safeguarded these
three sources of grain for the republic with the strongest
garrisons and fleets.  Everywhere, of all the pirates, some were
captured and killed, while the others gave themselves up to the
authority and power of this one man.  So, such a war it was,
lasting so long, spread so far and wide, overwhelming all
nations, that Cn. Pompey prepared for at the end of winter, took
up at the beginning of spring, and finished in the middle of the
summer.
