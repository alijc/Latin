Pompeii extraordinaria imperia

At enim "ne quid novi fiat contra exempla atque instituta maiorum."
Non dicam hoc loco maiores nostros semper in pace consuetudini,
in bello utilitati paruisse, semper ad novos casus
temporum novorum consiliorum rationes accommodasse.
Non dicam duo bella maxima, Punicum atque Hispaniense, ab
uno imperatore esse confecta duasque urbes potentissimas,
quae huic imperio maxime minitabantur, Carthaginem atque Numantiam,
ab eodem Scipione esse deletas.
Non commemorabo nuper ita vobis patribusque vestris esse visum
ut in uno C. Mario spes imperi poneretur, ut idem cum Iugurtha,
idem cum Cimbris, idem cum Teutonis bellum administraret.
In ipso Cn. Pompeio, in quo novi constitui nihil vult Q. Catulus,
quam multa sint nova, summa Q. Catuli voluntate, constituta recordamini.

Quid tam novum quam adulescentulum privatum exercitum
difficili rei publicae tempore conficere?  Confecit.
Huic praeesse? Praefuit.
Rem optime ductu suo gerere? Gessit.
Quid tam praeter consuetudinem quam homini peradulescenti,
cuius aetas a senatorio gradu longe abesset,
imperium atque exercitum dari,
Siciliam permitti atque Africam bellumque in ea provincia administrandum?
Fuit in his provinciis singulari innocentia, gravitate, virtute;
bellum in Africa maximum confecit; victorem exercitum deportavit.
Quid vero tam inauditum quam equitem Romanum triumphare?
At eam quoque rem populus Romanus non modo vidit,
sed omnium etiam studio visendam et concelebrandam putavit.
Quid tam inusitatum,
quam ut, cum duo consules clarissimi fortissimique essent,
eques Romanus ad bellum maximum formidolosissimumque pro consule mitteretur?
Missus est.
Quid tam singulare, quam ut, ex senatus consulto legibus solutus,
consul ante fieret quam ullum alium magistratum per leges capere licuisset?

Quid tam incredibile,
quam ut iterum eques Romanus ex senatus consulto triumpharet?19


Pompey's special powers

But then
"let nothing new be done contrary to the examples and customs of the ancestors."
I will not say at this point that our ancestors have always adhered to
convention in peace, and to pragmatism in war,
that they have always adapted new plans to new emergencies.
I will not say that two great wars, the Punic and Spanish,
were carried out by a single general and that two powerful cities,
Carthage and Numantia, which were greatly threatening to this general,
were destroyed by this same Scipio.
I will not mention what so recently was seen by you and your fathers,
that the hope of rule was placed in C. Marius alone,
to manage wars with Jugurtha, then with the Cimbri, then with the Teutons.
In the case of Cn. Pompey himself,
for whom Q. Catulus wishes to establish nothing new,
how many innovations, with the full approval of Q. Catulus,
might we call to mind.

What was more novel than for a young man to raise a private army
for the republic in a difficult time? He raised one.
To command it?  He commanded it.
To manage the affair so well by his leadership?  He managed it.
What was more extraordinary than for a very young man,
whose age was far from senatorial rank,
to be given a command and an army,
to be entrusted with administering Sicily and Africa and the war in that province?
It was in these provinces that, by singular integrety, dignity, and courage,
that he pursued the greatest war in Africa to victory
and brought the triumphant army home.
Indeed, what was more unheard of than a Roman knight celebrating a triumph?
But the Roman people not only watched this event,
but they all thought that it should even be seen over and over and celebrated
with enthusiasm.
What was more uncommon,
than, when the two consuls were so very renowned and powerful,
that a Roman knight be sent as proconsul to a great and formidable war?
He was sent.
What was more remarkable than, exempted from the laws by a decree of the senate,
that he be made a consul earlier than it had been permitted for
any other magistrate to legally accept the post?
What was more unbelievable than a Roman knight, by decree of the
senate, celebrating a second triumph.
