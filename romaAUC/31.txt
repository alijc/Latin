Cicero fabulam de quaestura sua narrat

Ita multa Romae geruntur ut vix ea quae fiunt in provinciis audiantur.
Non vereor ne mihi aliquid, iudices, videar adrogare, si de quaestura
mea dixero.  Vere me hercule hoc dicam: sic tum existimabam, nihil
homines aliud Romae nisi de quaestura mea loqui.  Frumenti in summa
caritate maximum numerum miseram; negotiatoribus comis, mercatoribus
iustus, mancipibus liberalis, sociis abstinens; omnibus eram visus in
omni officio diligentissimus, excogitati quidam erant a Siculis
honores in me inauditi.  Itaque hac spe decedebam, ut mihi populum
Romanum ultro omnia delaturum putarem.

At ego, cum decedens e provincia Puteolos forte venissem diebus iis
cum plurimi et lautissimi um solent esse in iis locis, concidi paene,
iudices, cum ex me quidam quaesisset quo die Roma exissem et num
quidnam esset novi.  Cui cum respondissem me e provincia decedere,
"Etiam me hercule," inquit, "ut opinor, ex Africa."  Huic ego, iam
stomachans, fastidiose, "Immo, ex Sicila," inquam.
....
Tum quidam quasi qui omnia sciret,
"Quid? tu nescis," inquit, "hunc Syracusis quaesturem fuisse?"
Quid multa?
Destiti stomachari, et me unum ex iis feci, qui ad aquas venisset.

Cicero tells a story about his quaestorship

So many things happen in Rome that they hardly hear tell of what
happens in the provinces.  I have no fear that I might seem to claim
aught for myself, jurors, if I speak about my quaestorship.  Truly, by
Hercules, I'll say this: I then thought thus, that men in Rome spoke
of nothing other than my quaestorship.  I had sent a huge amount of
grain in a time of high prices; I was courteous to traders, fair to
merchants, generous to agents, restrained to allies; in every duty I
seemed to all to be the most diligent, and certain unheard of honors
had been invented by Sicilians about me.  And so I left office in the
hope that the Roman people were going to grant me everything else besides.

But in leaving the province I had by chance come to Puteli during the
days when very many fashionable people were wont to be there.  I
nearly fell over, jurors, after some man asked me when I'd left Rome
and if there was any news.  And when I answered him that I was
returning from a province, he said, "Indeed, by Hercules, as I
suppose, from Africa."  And already boiling with rage, I disdainfully
told him, "On the contrary, from Sicily."

.....
Then someone, like a man who knows everything, said,
"What? Don't you know that this man was quaestor to Syracuse?"
In short?
I stopped being angry, and made myself one of those who had come for the waters.
