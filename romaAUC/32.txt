Cicero de consulatu suo

M. TULLIUS M. F. CICERO S. D. CN. POMPEIO CN. F. MAGNO IMPERATORI.
S.T.E.Q.V.B.E.  Ex litteris tuis, quas publice misisti, cepi una
cum omnibus incredibilem voluptatem; tantam enim spem oti
ostendisti, quantam ego semper omnibus, te uno fretus, pollicebar.
Ad me autem litteras quas misisti, quamquam exiguam
significationem tuae erga me voluntatis habebant, tamen mihi scito
iucundas fuisse.  Illud enim non dubito quin, si te mea summa erga
te studia parum mihi adiunxerint, res publica nos inter nos
conciliatura coniuncturaque sit.

Ne ignores quid ego in tuis litteris desiderarim, scribam aperte,
sicut et mea natura et nostra amicitia postulat.  Res eas gessi,
quarum aliquam in tuis litteris et nostrae necessitudinis et rei
publicae causa gratulationem exspectavi; quam ego abs te
praetermissam esse arbitror, quod vererere ne cuius animum
offenderes?  Sed scito ea, quae nos pro salute patriae gessimus,
orbis terrae iudicio ac testimonio comprobari.  Quae, cum veneris,
tanto consilio tantaque animi magnitudine a me gesta esse
cognosces, ut tibi (multo maiori quam Africanus fuit) me (non
multo minorem quam Laelium) facile et in re publica et in amicitia
adiunctum esse patiare.


Cicero on his consulship

M. Tullius Cicero greets General Cn. Pompey the Great

If you and the army prevail, it is good.  I took, along with
everyone else, incredible delight in your public missive; for you
have shown as much hope of peace as I, relying on you alone, have
always promised everyone.  But be assured that the letter that you
sent to me pleased me, even though it held little indication of
your favor towards me.  For this I do not doubt that if my
enthusiastic support for you hadn't sufficiently attached you to
me, the republic is going to unite us and join us together.

In case you don't know what I wanted from your letter, I'll write
openly, as both my nature and our friendship demands.  I expected
some congratulations in your letter for what I did, for the sake
of both our friendship of the republic.  But you seemed to have
left that out, maybe because you were afraid of hurting someone's
feelings?  But rest assured that what we have done for the
country's security is sanctioned by the verdict and testimony of
the world.  But, after you come, you will learn what I did with
such resolution and heroism, so that you'll readily allow yourself
(much more than Africanus was) to be joined to me (not much less
than Laelius) and in both the republic and in friendship.



CICERO ATTICO SAL.

Putavi mihi maiores quasdam opes et firmiora praesidia esse
quaerenda.  Itaque primum eum qui nimium diu de rebus nostris
tacuerat, Pompeium, adduxi in eam voluntatem ut in senatu non
semel sed saepe multisque verbis huius mihi salutem imperi atque
orbis terrarum adiudicarit.  Cum hoc ego me tanta familiaritate
coniunxi ut uterque nostrum in sua ratione munitior et in re
publica firmior hac coniunctione esse possit.

Commentarium consulatus mei Graece compositum misi ad te.  Latinum
si perfecero, ad te mittam.  Tertium poema exspectato, ne quod
genus a me ipso laudis meae praetermittatur.


Cicero greets Atticus

I thought that some greater resources and firmer aid needs be
sought out for me.  And so I first persuaded the man who had too
long been silent about our matters, Pompey, into such good will
that in the senate he attributed, not just once but often and in
many speeches, the security of both the state and the world to me.
I connected myself with him in such familiarity that through this
union each of us could be more secure and steadier in his own
policy and in his political position.

I've sent you an outline of my consulship, written in Greek.  If I
finish the Latin, I'll send it to you.  Thirdly, expect a poem,
lest any sort of my praise be omitted by myself.
