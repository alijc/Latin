Gaius Iulius Caesar

C. Caesar, nobilissima Iuliorum genitus familia et ab Anchise ac
Venere deducens genus, forma omnium civium excellentissimus,
vigore animi acerrimus, munificentia effusissimus, fuit C. Mario
sanguine coniunctissimus atque idem Cinnae gener, cuius filiam ut
repudiaret nullo metu a Sulla compelli potuit.  Magnitudine
cogitationum, celeritate bellandi, patientia periculorum Magno
illi Alexandro simillimus erat.  Quaestor quidem in ulteriore
Hispania, animadversa Gadibus apud Herculis templum Magni
Alexandri imagine, ingemuit et quasi pertaesus ignaviam suam, quod
nihildum a se memorabile actum esset in aetate qua iam Alexander
orbem terrarum subegisset, missionem continuo efflagitavit ad
captandas quam primum maiorum rerum occasiones in urbe.

Caesar autem fuisse traditur excelsa statura, colore candido,
teretibus membris, ore paulo pleniore, nigris vegetisque oculis,
valitudine prospera, nisi quod tempore extremo repente animo
linqui atque etiam per somnum exterreri solebat.  Comitiali quoque
morbo bis inter res agendas correptus est.  Circa corporis curam
morosior; calvitii vero deformitatem iniquissime tulit.

====================
Pronum et sumptuosum in libidines fuisse constans opinio est,
plurimasque et illustres feminas corrupisse, in quibus Tertullam Marci Crassi,
etiam Gnaei Pompeii Muciam.
Sed ante alias dilexit Marci Bruti matrem Serviliam,
cui primo suo consulatu sexagiens sestertium margaritam mercatus est.
Dilexit et reginas, maxime Cleopatram,
cum qua et convivia in primam lucem saepe protraxit et Aethiopiam penetrasset,
nisi exercitus sequi recusasset.
Quam denique accitam in urbem,
non nisi maximis honoribus praemiisque auctam remisit,
filiumque natum appellare nomine suo passus est,
quem quidem nonnulli Graecorum similem fuisse Caesari et forma et incessu tradiderunt.

Vini parcissimum ne inimici quidem negaverunt.
Marci Catonis est:
unum ex omnibus Caesarem ad evertendam rem publicam sobrium accessisse.
Studium et fides erga clientis ei ne iuveni quidem defuerunt
atque amicos magna semper facilitate indulgentiaque tractavit.
Iam autem rerum potens quosdam etiam infimi generis ad amplissimos honores provexit,
quam ob rem culpatus est.
Simultates, contra, nullas tam graves excepit umquam,
ut non occasione oblata libens deponeret.


Gaius Julius Caesar

C. Caesar, born to the very noble clan of the Julians and tracing
his lineage from Anchises and Venus, the most distinguished of all
citizens in appearance, the keenest in the vigor of his intellect,
the most extravagant in his bountifulness, was related to
C. Marius and was also Cinna's son-in-law.  But fear of Sulla
wasn't enough to compel him to repudiate Cinna's daughter.  In the
intensity of his thoughts, his speed in engaging in battle, and
his endurance of dangers he resembled the famed Alexander the
Great.  Indeed, as quaestor in furthest Spain, when he noticed a
statue of Alexander the Great at the temple of Hercules at Cadiz,
he groaned as if disgusted by his own idleness, because he'd done
nothing memorable at the age at which Alexander had already
subjugated the world.  And he demanded a leave at once, to set
about in grabbing opportunities of greater import in the City as
quickly as possible.

Now Caesar was related to have been tall in stature, fair in
coloring, with tapering limbs, a mouth a bit too full, lively
black eyes, and in prosperous good health, except that at the end
of his life he was wont to unexpectedly faint, and also to start
in fear in his sleep.  Also, he was twice felled by epilepsy while
conducting public business.  He was rather persnickety about
taking care of his body; indeed, he bore the blemish of his
baldness with impatience.

It is the resolute belief that he was prone to and lavish in his
love affairs, and that he seduced a great many illustrious women,
among them Marcus Crassus' Tertulla, and also Gnaeus Pompey's
Mucia.  But he loved Marcus Brutus' mother Servilia above all
others, for whom he bought, during his first consulship, a pearl
worth six million sestertii. He even loved queens, especially
Cleopatra.  Banquets with her often stretched out to daybreak, and
he would have entered Ethiopia with her, had the army not refused
to follow them.  In the end, he brought her to the City and didn't
send her back until he'd honored her with very great gifts and
rewards, and allowed her to give his own name to the son that had
been born to her.  Indeed, several Greeks related that he
resembled Caesar in both form and gait.

He was most sparing of wine, as not even his enemies denied.
There is a remark of Marcus Cato: that Caesar alone of all men
came close to overthrowing the republic sober.  Not even the young
people lacked zeal and loyalty towards his clients and he always
managed his friends with great good nature and indulgence.  But
after he became dictator he advanced some men of even the basest
sort to greater honors, and was censured because of this.  On the
other hand, he never received enimities so serious that he
couldn't lay them aside when the opportunity presented itself.
