A. Prior Triumviratus initus est

Inter C. Caesarem et Cn. Pompeium et M. Crassum inita est potentiae
societas, quae urbi orbique terrarum nec minus, diverso cuique
tempore, ipsis exitiabilis fuit.  Hoc consilium sequendi Pompeius
causam habuerat, ut tandem acta in transmarinis provinciis, quibus
multi obtrectabant, per Caesarem consulem confirmarentur.  Caesar
autem, quod animadvertebat se, cedendo Pompeii gloriae, aucturum
suam, et, invidia communis potentiae in illum relegata, confirmaturum
vires suas.  Crassus, ut principatum, quem solus adsequi non poterat,
auctoritate Pompeii, viribus Caesaris teneret.  Adfinitas etiam inter
Caesarem Pompeiumque contracta nuptiis; quippe Iuliam, filiam
C. Caesaris, Cn. Magnus duxit uxorem.


Before the triumvirate began

Between C. Caesar and Cn. Pompey and M. Crassus there began an
alliance of power over the city and the empire, and which was no
less, at a different time for each, fatal for each of them.  Pompey
had a reason for following this policy - so that his deeds in the
overseas provinces, which many had opposed, might finally be
confirmed by the consul Caesar.  But Caesar, because he was looking
after his own interests - to increase his own fame while letting
Pompey's slip away, and after the public hatred for power shifted to
Pompey, to secure power of his own.  While Crassus - to hold on to a
position of leadership that he couldn't gain alone, using the
authority of Pompey, and the power of Caesar.  Furthermore the
relationship between Caesar and Pompey was sealed by a marriage; for
you see, Cn. Magnus married Julia, the daughter of C. Caesar.



B. Cicero se cum Triumviris coniungere non vult

Fuit apud me Cornelius, hunc dico Balbum, Caesaris familiarem.
Is adfirmabat illum omnibus in rebus meo et Pompei consilio
usurum daturumque operam ut cum Pompeio Crassum coniungeret.  Hic
sunt haec: coniunctio mihi summa cum Pompeio; si placet, etiam
cum Caesare; reditus in gratiam cum inimicis; pax cum multitudine
senectutis otium.  Sed me hortatio mea illa commovet, quae est in
libro tertio:

	Interea cursus, quos prima a parte iuventae
	Quosque adeo consul virtute animoque petisti,
	Hos retine atque auge: famam laudesque bonorum.


Cicero is unwilling to join the Triumvirs

At my house was a close friend of Caesar's, Cornelius, the one
called Balbus.  He was affirming that Caesar was going to follow
my and Pompey's plan in all things and would try to reconcile
Crassus with Pompey.  Here are the following advantages: the
utmost fellowship for me with Pompey; if agreeable, with Caesar
as well; a reconciliation with my enemies; peace with the multitude,
and the leisure of old age.  But this exhortation of mine, from my
third book, agitated me:

   Meanwhile you sought, with strength and spirit, those courses of action,
   which you held from your earliest youth and also when you became consul.
   Hold on to and add to these; the renown and praises of good men.



C. Cicero totam rem publicam perisse queritur

Tenemur undique neque iam, quo minus servimus, recusamus,
sed mortem et eiectionem timemus.
Universa res eo est deducta,
spes ut nulla sit aliquando non modo privatos,
verum etiam magistratus liberos fore.

Sed de re publica non libet plura scribere.
Displiceo mihi, nec sine summo scribo dolore.
Me tueor, ut oppressis omnibus non demisse;
ut tantis rebus gestis, parum fortiter.
Sed tamen quod est subinane in nobis, id adficitur quadam delectatione.
Solebat me pungere,
ne Sampsicerami merita in patriam ad annos sescentos maiora viderentur quam nostra.
Hac quidem cura certe iam vacuus sum; iacet enim ille sic abiectus.
Nam, quondam insolens infamiae, semper in laude versatus, circumfluens gloria,
nunc deformatus corpore, fractus animo, quo se conferat nescit;
progressum praecipitem, inconstantem reditum videt;
bonos inimicos habet, improbos ipsos non amicos.25


Cicero complains that the entire republic has been destroyed

We are mastered from every side and no longer object to being slaves,
but fear death and exile.
The whole matter has been led down to this,
so that there might be no hope that not only ordinary citizens,
but in truth even magistrates would be free.

But it is not permitted to write more about the republic.
I displease myself, and I do not write without with the utmost sorrow.
I hold myself up, not as stooped under all oppressions;
but with such things having been done, not brave enough.
But yet what is somewhat vain in us, affects us with a certain delight.
It would seem to vex me,
that Sampsiceramus' services against the fatherland for about six hundred years
did not seem greater than ours.
Indeed, surely I am now free of this concern; for he lies so cast down.
For, formerly unaccustomed to dishonor, ever whirled in praise, and overflowing
with renown, 
now disfigured in body and broken in spirit, he doesn't know where to turn;
he sees advance as precipitous, and withdrawl as inconstant;
he has the conservatives as enemies, and the wicked themselves are not his friends.
