A. Caesaris res gestae

Nullius tantum flumen est ingeni, nullius dicendi aut scribendi
tanta vis, tanta copia, quae non dicam exornare, sed enarrare,
C. Caesar, res tuas gestas possit.  Soleo saepe ante oculos
ponere idque libenter crebris usurpare sermonibus, omnis
nostrorum imperatorum, omnis exterarum gentium
potentissimorumque populorum, omnis clarissimorum regum res
gestas cum tuis nec contentionum magnitudine nec numero
proeliorum nec varietate regionum nec celeritate conficiendi nec
dissimilitudine bellorum posse conferri.  Quae quidem ego nisi
ita magna esse fatear, ut ea vix cuiusquam mens aut cogitatio
capere possit, amens sim.  Nam domuisti gentis immanitate
barbaras, multitudine innumerabilis, locis infinitas, omni
copiarum genere abundantis.  Itaque, C. Caesar, bellicae tuae
laudes celebrabuntur non solum nostris, sed paene omnium gentium
litteris atque linguis, nec ulla umquam aetas de tuis laudibus
conticescet.


The things done by Caesar

There is no flood of such eloquence, no such abundance or such
power of speech or writing, that would be able to embellish in
speech, or even to merely describe your deeds, Caesar.  I am
accustomed to often place my art before people's eyes and to
freely talk of it in repeated speeches, that all of our
commanders, all of the foreign tribes and powerful peoples,
all of the illustrious kings, the deeds can be discussed with
neither the intensity of your struggles or the number of your
battles or the variety of your regions or the speed of
pacificating or the differences between your wars.  And indeed,
if I don't admit that it's so great that hardly anyone has the
judgment or reasoning to take it in, I'd be insane.  For you
master barbarian peoples with brutality, innumerable ones with a
mob, boundless ones with regions, and rich ones with every sort
of wealth.  And so, Caesar, your martial praises will be
celebrated, in writing and speech, not only by our people but by
nearly everyone as well, and no age will ever fall silent on
your glories.



B. Inimicitia Clodii cum Cicerone

Ante consulatum Caesaris P. Clodius, homo nobilis, disertus, audax,
malorum propositorum exsecutor acerrimus, infamis etiam sororis
stupro, actus est incesti reus ob initum inter religiosissima
populi Romani sacra adulterium.  Tum, cum graves inimicitias cum
M. Cicerone exerceret et a patribus ad plebem transisset, legem in
tribunatu tulit, ut qui civem Romanum indemnatum interemisset, ei
aqua et igni interdiceretur.  Cuius verbis etsi non nominabatur
Cicero, tamen solus petebatur.  Ita vir optime meritus de re
publica conservatae patriae pretium calamitatem exsilii tulit.  Non
caruerunt suspicione oppressi Ciceronis Caesar et Pompeius.  Sed
Cicero intra biennium, sera Cn. Pompeii cura, votisque Italiae ac
decretis senatus, virtute atque actione Annii Milonis tribuni
plebis, dignitati patriaeque restitutus est.  Neque post Numidici
exsilium aut reditum quisquam aut expulsus invidiosius aut receptus
est laetius.


The enmity between Clodis and Cicero

Before the consulship of Caesar, P. Clodius, a well-born man,
eloquent, daring, the keenest agent of evil projects, notorius as
well for deflowering his sister, was charged with profanation for
engaging in adultery during the most sacred rites of the Roman
people.  Then, after he engaged in serious hostilities with
M. Cicero and crossed over from the fathers to the commoners, he
won a motion in the tribuneship, that whoever put an end to a Roman
citizen who had not been condemned would be forbidden water and
fire.  And although Cicero was not called out by name, nevertheless
he alone was the target.  Thus the man who rightly deserved a
reward from the republic for preserving the homeland instead bore
the calamity of exile.  Caesar and Pompey, having been oppressed by
Cicero, were not free from suspicion.  But within two years,
through the tardy attention of Cn. Pompey, the pledges of Italy and
a decree of the Senate, and the courage and actions of Annius Milo,
the tribune of the plebs, Cicero was restored to his office and his
native land.  And not since the exile of Numidicus or his return
was anyone either banished so odiously or received back more
joyfully.


C. Cicero de suo exsilio

Servavi igitur rem publicam discessu meo, iudices;
caedem a vobis liberisque vestris, vastitatem, incendia, rapinas meo dolore luctuque depuli; 
et unus bis rem publicam servavi, semel gloria, iterum aerumna mea.
Nonne, si meam vitam deseruissem, rem publicam prodidissem? 
In qua quidem nunc, me restituto, vivit mecum simul exemplum fidei publicae.
Quod si immortale retinetur, 18
quis non intelligit immortalem hanc civitatem futuram?

Cicero on his exile

I preserved the republic through my departure, my judges;
I kept you and your children from slaughter, devastation, fires, and rapes by my
suffering and grief;
and I alone preserved the republic twice,
once through my renown, and a second time through my hardship.
If I had quitted my life, wouldn't I have betrayed the republic?
In which indeed now, at my restoration, there likewise lives in me an example
of public trust;
if this example is retained forever,
who does not understand that this city will be immoral?
