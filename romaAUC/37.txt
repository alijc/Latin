M. CICERO S. D. L. LVCCEIO Q. F.

Ardeo cupiditate incredibili (neque, ut ego arbitror,
reprehendenda) nomen ut nostrum scriptis inlustretur et
celebretur tuis.  Genus enim scriptorum tuorum vicit opinionem
meam meque ita incendit ut cuperem quam celerrime res nostras
monumentis commendari tuis.  Quia videbam Italici belli et
civilis historiam iam a te paene esse perfectam, dixeras autem
mihi te reliquas res ordiri, te admonebam ut civilem
coniurationem ab hostilibus externisque bellis seiungeres.  Neque
tamen ignoro quam impudenter faciam, qui primum tibi tantum
oneris imponam, deinde etiam ut ornes mea facta postulem.  Quid,
si illa tibi non tanto opere videntur ornanda?  Sed tamen, qui
semel verecundiae finis transierit, eum bene et naviter oportet
esse impudentem.  Itaque te plane etiam atque etiam rogo, ut et
ornes ea vehementius etiam quam fortasse sentis, et in eo leges
historiae neglegas, amorique nostro plusculum etiam quam concedet
veritas largiare.

Si te adducemus ut hoc suscipias,
erit (ut mihi persuadeo) materies digna facultate et copia tua.
A principio enim coniurationis usque ad reditum nostrum videtur
mihi modicum quoddam corpus confici posse.
Multam etiam casus nostri varietatem tibi in scribendo suppeditabunt plenam
cuiusdam voluptatis,
quae vehementer animos hominum in legendo, te scriptore, tenere possit. 
Nihil est enim aptius ad delectationem lectoris quam temporum varietates
fortunaeque vicissitudines.
Quae etsi nobis optabiles in experiendo non fuerunt,
in legendo tamen erunt iucundae;
habet enim praeteriti doloris secura recordatio delectationem.

Quod si a te non impetro, cogar fortasse facere quod non nulli saepe reprehendunt;
scribam ipse de me, multorum tamen exemplo et clarorum virorum.
Sed, quod te non fugit, haec sunt in hoc genere vitia: 
et verecundius ipsi de sese scribant necesse est
si quid est laudandum, et praetereant, si quid reprehendendum est.
Accedit etiam ut minor sit fides, minor auctoritas, multi denique reprehendant.
Haec nos vitare cupimus et, si recipis causam nostram, vitabimus.
Ac ne forte mirere cur a te id nunc tanto opere et tam multis verbis petamus,
nos cupiditas incendit ut et ceteri, viventibus nobis,
ex libris tuis nos cognoscant et nosmet ipsi vivi gloriola nostra perfruamur.


M. Cicero sends greetings to L. Lucceius

I burn with a desire that is extraodinary (but not, as I think,
reprehensible) for my name to be illuminated and celebrated in
your writings.  For the quality of your writings has surpassed my
expectation and therefore fires me to want my affairs to be
written down in your histories as soon as possible.  Because I
see that your history of the Italian and Civil Wars is nearly
done now, and since you told me that you were starting on what was
left, I admonish you to separate the civil plot out from the
hostile and foreign wars.  And yet I am not ignorant of how
shamelessly I am behaving, in first imposing such a great burden,
then also demanding that you embellish my deeds.  What if these
seem not very well prepared to you?  But still, whoever crosses
the threshold of modesty once, it behooves him to be well and
wholly shameless.  And so I plainly beg you, again and yet again,
both to dress up the facts even more vigorously than you perhaps
see them, and to disregard the laws of history in this, by
granting to our friendship even more than truth will allow.

If I persuade you to undertake this, your material will be
(as I convince myself) with a suitable opportunity and abundance.
For it seems to me that a rather modest volume could be composed
from the beginning of the conspiracy up to my return.
Yet my misfortunes will supply a great variety to you in writing,
filled with a kind of pleasure, with which you, as the author,
should be able to transfix the minds of men in reading it.
For there is nothing more suitable to gaining the delight of a reader than
shifting conditions and changes of fortune.
And although experiencing these things wasn't something I wished for,
nevertheless they will be pleasant to read about; 
for a recollection of past grief confers delight.

Because if I don't get this from you, perhaps I'll be forced to do
what some often find fault with; I myself will write about myself,
after the example of still many illustrious men. 
But, as I'm sure you are aware, these are the faults in this sort of writing:
and it is necessary for those who write about themselves to be more modest
if anything ought to be praised,
and to overlook it if anything ought to be faulted.
Moreover there is less loyalty, less authority, and many find fault in the end.
We desire to avoid these things and, if you undertake my case,
we will avoid them.
And so you may not by chance wonder why I now ask you for it so earnestly and
with so many words,
Passion kindles me so that others, while I live,
might come to know me through your books
and I myself, while living, might enjoy my bit of glory.
