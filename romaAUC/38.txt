De belli civilis secundi causis

A. CAELIVS CICERONI S.

De summa re publica saepe tibi scripsi me ad annum pacem non
videre et, quo propius ea contentio (quam fieri necesse est)
accedit, eo clarius id periculum apparet.  Propositum hoc est, de
quo qui rerum potiuntur sunt dimicaturi, quod Cn. Pompeius
constituit non pati C. Caesarem consulem aliter fieri nisi
exercitum et provincias tradiderit.  Caesari autem persuasum est
se salvum esse non posse si ab exercitu recesserit; fert illam
tamen condicionem, ut ambo exercitus tradant.  Sic illi amores et
invidiosa coniunctio non ad occultam recidit obtrectationem, sed
ad bellum se erupit.  Neque mearum rerum quid consili capiam
reperio; quod non dubito quin te quoque haec deliberatio sit
perturbatura.  Illud te non arbitror fugere quin homines in
dissensione domestica debeant, quam diu civiliter sine armis
certetur, honestiorem sequi partem; ubi ad bellum et castra
ventum sit, firmiorem.  In hac discordia video Cn. Pompeium
senatum secum habiturum; ad Caesarem omnis qui cum timore aut
mala spe vivant accessuros; exercitum conferendum non esse.  Si
alter uter eorum ad Parthicum bellum non eat, video magnas
impendere discordias, quas ferrum et vis iudicabit; uterque et
animo et copiis est paratus.  Si sine tuo periculo fieri posset,
magnum et iucundum tibi Fortuna spectaculum parabat.


On the causes of the second civil war

A. Caelius to Cicero, greetings

I have often written to you with regard to this great republic,
that I see no peace for the space of a year and, the closer the
contention (which must needs come about) nears, the danger
appears that much more clearly.  The point at hand, which our
masters will be forced to fight over, is as follows, that
Gn. Pompey decided not to allow G. Caesar to be appointed in any
other way but for him to surrender his army and provinces.  But
Caesar was convinced that he wouldn't be safe if he withdrew from
his army; instead he offered another option, that they should
both surrender their armies.  Thus these friendships and the
hated partnership didn't collapse into a covert disparagement,
but broke out into war.  And I can't figure out a plan for taking
care of my own affairs; while I have no doubt that you will also
be thrown into confusion by this deliberation.  I'm sure that you
realize that in a personal quarrel, which has long been contested
civilly without resorting to arms, men ought to follow the more
honorable side; and when it comes to war and camp, the stronger
one.  In this discord I think that Gn. Pompey will hold the
senate to his side; that all those who live in fear or despair
will draw near to Caesar; and that his army is incomparable.  If
one or the other of them doesn't go to the Parthian war I see
great discords threatening, which force of arms will decide; each
is ready, in both spirit and troops.  If it can come about
without danger to you, fortune has prepared a great and pleasant
spectacle for you.


B. Pompeius, ab inimicis Caesaris incitatus et quod neminem
dignitate secum exaequari volebat, totum se ab eius amicitia
averterat et cum communibus inimicis in gratiam redierat, quorum
ipse maximam partem illo affinitatis tempore iniunxerat Caesari;
simul infamia duarum legionum permotus, quas ab itinere Asiae
Syriaeque ad suam potentiam dominatumque converterat, rem ad arma
deduci studebat.  Caesar autem non maleficii causa ex provincia
egressus est, sed ut se a contumeliis inimicorum defenderet, ut
tribunos plebis iniuria ex civitate expulsos in suam dignitatem
restitueret, ut se et populum Romanum factione paucorum oppressum
in libertatem vindicaret.


Pompey, urged on by Caesar's enemies and because he wanted nobody
to be his equal in rank, had completely turned away from Caesar's
friendship and had been reconciled with their common enemies, the
greatest part of whom he had imposed on Caesar when they were
in-laws.  At the same time, disturbed by the reproach of the
matter of the two legions that Pompey had redirected from the
Syrian campaign to his own command, Caesar was eager for the
matter to lead to warfare.  But he marched out of his province not
for he sake of doing evil, but to protect himself from the abuses
of his enemies, to restore the positions of people's tribunes, who
had been unjustly expelled from the city, and to avenge himself
and the Roman people, oppressed in their liberty by the party of
the elite.
