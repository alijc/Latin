Belli civilis secundi initia

Intra breve deinde spatium belli civilis exarserunt initia, cum
iustissimus quisque et a Caesare et a Pompeio vellet dimitti
exercitus.  Pompeium senatus auctoritas, Caesarem militum armavit
fiducia.  Nihil relictum a Caesare, quod servandae pacis causa
temptari posset, nihil receptum a Pompeianis.  Ad ultimum,
saluberrimas condiciones pacis, quas et Caesar iustissimo animo
postulabat et Pompeius aequo recipiebat, Curio discussit ac rupit,
unice cavente Cicerone concordiae publicae.  Deinde Caesar,
spretis omnibus quae postulaverat, et adversariis negantibus ullam
se de re publica facturos pactionem, transiit in citeriorem
Galliam, bello vindicaturus tribunos plebis pro se intercedentis.

Et praetextum quidem illi civilium armorum hoc fuit; causas autem
alias fuisse opinantur.  Cn. Pompeius enim ita dictitabat
Caesarem, quod neque opera consummare quae instituerat, neque
populi exspectationem quam de adventu suo fecerat privatis opibus
explere posset, turbare omnia ac permiscere voluisse.  Alii eum
timuisse dicunt ne eorum, quae primo consulatu adversus auspicia
legesque et inter cessiones gessisset, rationem reddere cogeretur;
cum M. Cato identidem, nec sine iure iurando, denuntiaret
delaturum se nomen eius, simul ac primum exercitum dimisisset.
Quod probabilius faci Asinius Pollio, referens Caesarem,
Pharsalica acie caesos profligatos que adversarios prospicientem,
haec dixisse: “Hoc voluerunt; tantis rebus gestis, Gaius Caesar
condemnatus essem, nisi ab exercitu auxilium petissem.”  Quidam
putant eum imperii consuetudine captum, pensitatisque suis et
inimicorum viribus, usum occasione rapiendae dominationis quam ab
aetate prima concupisset.


Cum ergo sublatam tribunorum intercessionem ipsosque urbe cessisse nuntiatum esset, 16
progressus est ad Rubiconem flumen, qui provinciae eius finis erat.
Ibi paulum constitit, ac reputans quantum moliretur, 17
"Etiam nunc," inquit, "regredi possumus; quod si ponticulum transierimus, omnia armis agenda erunt.” 18
Cunctanti ostentum tale factum est. 19
Quidam eximia magnitudine et forma repente apparuit 20 et,
rapta ab uno aeneatore tuba, ingenti spiritu classicum exorsus,
pertendit ad alteram ripam fluminis.21
Tunc Caesar "Eatur," inquit, "quo deorum ostenta et inimicorum iniquitas vocat.22
Iacta alea esto." 23
Atque ita exercitum Rubiconem in Italiam traiecit.24
Cum autem Caesar Romae appropinquaret,
Pompeius consulesque et maior pars senatus, relicta urbe ac deinde Italia, transmisere Dyrrachium. 25




The beginnings of the second civil war

Within a short time afterwards the beginnings of the civil war
flared up, when every honorable man wanted both Caesar's and Pompey's
armies to be disbanded.  The authority of the senate armed Pompey,
as the soldiers' confidence did Caesar.  Nothing that could be
attempted for keeping the peace was left undone by Caesar, nothing
was accepted by Pompey.  At the last, the very salubrious terms
of peace, that Caesar was asking for with a just spirit and Pompey
accepting the same way, were struck down and destroyed by Curio,
with only Cicero giving security for the public harmony.  Then
Caesar, scorned in everything that he'd demanded, and with his
enemies refusing any compromise with him concerning the republic,
crossed into the near side of Gaul, intended to avenge with
warfare the tribunes of the plebs, who were interceding on his
behalf.



And this was a pretext of civil arms for him, at least; but people
supposed that it was for other reasons.  For thus Gn. Pompey kept
repeating that Caesar wanted to disturb and confound everything,
because he could neither complete the work that he'd started, nor
satisfy the people's expectation, which he'd created from his
arrival with his private wealth.  Others say that he feared that
he'd be forced to render an account of his deeds, contrary to the
omens and laws, in his first consulship and between the sessions;
since M. Cato repeatedly, and not without an oath, had threatened
to indict him as soon as his first army had disbanded.  And this
is made more plausible with Asinius Pollio reporting that Caesar,
when he saw from afar the enemies routed and slaughtered in the
Pharsalian battle array, said this: "They wanted this: I, Gaius
Caesar, despite having done such great things, would have been
condemned, had I not asked for aid from the army."  Some people
think that he, under the hold of his experience of command, and
after considering the strength of his and his enemy's forces, made
use of the opportunity for seizing the power that he had lusted
after from his youth.
