Proelium Pharsalicum

Pompeius, ut equitatum suum pulsum vidit atque eam partem,
cui maxime confidebat, perterritam animadvertit, aliis quoque diffisus,
acie excessit 
protinusque se in castra equo contulit
et iis centurionibus,
quos in statione ad praetoriam portam posuerat,
clare, ut milites exaudirent,
"Tuemini," inquit, "castra et defendite diligenter, si quid durius acciderit.
Ego reliquas portas circumeo et castrorum praesidia confirmo."
Haec cum dixisset, se in praetorium contulit,
summae rei diffidens et tamen eventum exspectans.

Caesar, Pompeianis ex fuga intra vallum compulsis,
nullum spatium perterritis dari oportere existimans,
milites cohortatus est, ut beneficio fortunae uterentur castraque oppugnarent.
Qui, etsi magno aestu fatigati (nam ad meridiem res erat perducta),
tamen ad omnem laborem animo parati imperio paruerunt.
Castra a cohortibus, quae ibi praesidio erant relictae,
industrie defendebantur,9 multo etiam acrius a Thracibus barbarisque auxiliis.
Nam, qui ex acie refugerant milites,
et animo perterriti et lassitudine confecti,11
missis plerique

The Battle of Pharsalus

Pompey, when he saw the defeat of his cavalry
and observed that the part that he relied upon the most had panicked,
and lacking confidence in the others as well,
withdrew from the line and rode straight into camp
and said to the centurions whom he had posted on watch at the main gate,
clearly, so that the soldiers could hear,
"Protect the camp and defend it diligently, if the worst should happen.
I'm going round the other gates and will reassure the camp's garrisons."
After he said this, he went into his tent,
lacking confidence in the chief matter, and yet awaiting events.

Caesar, after driving Pompey's fleeing forces within the ramparts,
thinking to give no rest to the terrified men,
urged his men to make use of the favor of fortune and storm the camp.
And although they were weary with great agitation
(for the affair had been prolonged up to midday)
nevertheless, prepared in spirit for all labor, they obeyed the command.
The camp was industriously defended by the cohorts the had been left there as a
garrison, and even more keenly by the Thracian and barbarian auxiliaries.

for, those soldiers who had fled from the line,
and terrified in spirit and done in with exhaustion,
having been sent the most/a great part....
