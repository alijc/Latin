Proelium Pharsalicum

Pompeius, ut equitatum suum pulsum vidit atque eam partem, cui maxime
confidebat, perterritam animadvertit, aliis quoque diffisus, acie
excessit protinusque se in castra equo contulit et iis centurionibus,
quos in statione ad praetoriam portam posuerat, clare, ut milites
exaudirent, "Tuemini," inquit, "castra et defendite diligenter, si
quid durius acciderit.  Ego reliquas portas circumeo et castrorum
praesidia confirmo."  Haec cum dixisset, se in praetorium contulit,
summae rei diffidens et tamen eventum exspectans.

Caesar, Pompeianis ex fuga intra vallum compulsis, nullum spatium
perterritis dari oportere existimans, milites cohortatus est, ut
beneficio fortunae uterentur castraque oppugnarent.  Qui, etsi magno
aestu fatigati (nam ad meridiem res erat perducta), tamen ad omnem
laborem animo parati imperio paruerunt.  Castra a cohortibus, quae
ibi praesidio erant relictae, industrie defendebantur, multo etiam
acrius a Thracibus barbarisque auxiliis.  Nam, qui ex acie refugerant
milites, et animo perterriti et lassitudine confecti, missis plerique
armis signisque militaribus, magis de fuga quam de castrorum
defensione cogitabant.  Neque vero diutius, qui in vallo
constiterant, multitudinem telorum sustinere potuerant, sed confecti
vulneribus locum reliquerunt, protinusque omnes, ducibus usi
centurionibus tribunisque militum, in altissimos montes, qui ad
castra pertinebant, confugerunt.

In castris Pompei videre licuit trichilas structas, magnum argenti
tabernacula constrata, pondus expositum, recentibus caespitibus
tabernacula Luci etiam Lentuli et non nullorum tabernacula protecta
hedera, multaque praeterea, quae nimiam luxuriem et victoriae
fiduciam designarent, ut facile existimari posset, nihil eos de
eventu eius diei timuisse, qui non necessarias conquirerent
voluptates.  At hi miserrimo ac patientissimo exercitui Caesaris
luxuriem obiciebant, cui semper omnia ad necessarium usum defuissent.
Pompeius, iam cum intra vallum nostri versarentur, equum nactus,
detractis insignibus imperatoriis, decumana porta se ex castris
eiecit protinusque equo citato Larisam contendit.  Neque ibi
constitit, sed eadem celeritate, paucos suos ex fuga nactus, nocturno
itinere non intermisso, comitatu equitum triginta, ad mare pervenit
navemque frumentariam conscendit, saepe, ut dicebatur, querens,
tantum se opinionem fefellisse, ut, a quo genere hominum victoriam
sperasset, ab eo initio fugae facto, paene proditus videretur.


The Battle of Pharsalus

When Pompey saw the defeat of his cavalry and observed that the part
that he relied upon the most had panicked, and lacking confidence in
the others as well, he withdrew from the line and rode straight into
camp and said to the centurions whom he had posted on watch at the
main gate, clearly, so that the soldiers could hear, "Protect the
camp and defend it diligently, if the worst should happen.  I'm going
round the other gates and will shore up the camp's garrisons."  After
he said this, he went into his tent, lacking confidence in the chief
matter, and yet awaiting events.

After Caesar drove Pompey's fleeing forces within the ramparts, he
judged that the terrified men should have no respite, and urged his
men to take advantage of fortune's favor and storm the camp.  And
although they were weary with the great heat (for the affair had
stretched out to midday) nevertheless, prepared in spirit for all
labor, they obeyed the command.  The camp was industriously defended
by the cohorts that had been left there as a garrison, and even more
keenly by the Thracian and barbarian auxiliaries.  For those soldiers
who had fled from the line, terrified in spirit and done in with
exhaustion, and with most of them having thrown away their weapons
and military standards, were thinking more of flight than in
defending the camp.  And indeed, the men who had stayed on the
ramparts could no longer deal with the huge number of projectiles,
but half-dead from their wounds abandoned their position, and all fled
straight into the highest mountains that touched on the camp, using
centurions and military tribunes as their leaders.

In Pompey's camp it was possible to see erected arbors, a great deal
of silver, a weight set out, Lucius' and also Lentulus' huts built
of freshly cut turf and several huts covered with ivy, and many
other things as well, which could well point out excessive luxury and
confidence of victory, so that it was easy to think that those who
were seeking out delights rather than necessities hadn't a qualm
about the success of the day.  But these were the men who had cast
luxury in the teeth of Caesar's wretched and long-suffering army, who
had been lacking all of the necessities of life.  Pompey, when our
men were already running about within the palisade, grabbed a horse,
ripped his general's insignia off, and shot out of the camp through
the rear gate and made straight for Larisa at a full gallop.  But he
didn't stop there, but snatched up a few of his men from their flight
and, without slowing down, rode through the night with an escort of
thirty horsemen, until he reached the sea and boarded a supply ship.
He often, or so it is said, complained that his judgment had badly
deceived him, so that he almost seemed betrayed, because the men that
he had hoped would give him victory had fled from the first.
