A Caesaris caedes

Conspiratum est in Caesarem a sexaginta amplius, Gaio Cassio
Marcoque et Decimo Bruto principibus conspirationis.  Qui,
postquam senatus Idibus Martiis in Pompeii curiam edictus est,
tempus et locum ut maxime idoneum praetulerunt.  Caesarem curiam
introeuntem et adsidentem conspirati specie officii
circumsteterunt; ilicoque Cimber Tillius, qui primas partes
susceperat, quasi aliquid rogaturus propius accessit; renuentique
et gestu in aliud tempus differenti ab utroque umero togam
apprehendit; deinde clamantem "Ista quidem vis est!"  alter e
Cascis aversum vulnerat paulum infra iugulum.  Caesar Cascae
bracchium adreptum graphio traiecit conatusque prosilire alio
vulnere tardatus est; utque animadvertit undique se strictis
pugionibus peti, toga caput obvolvit, simul Sinistra manu sinum
ad ima crura deduxit, quo honestius caderet etiam inferiore
corporis parte velata.  Atque ita tribus et viginti plagis
confossus est, uno modo ad primum ictum gemitu sine voce edito,
etsi tradiderunt quidam Marco Bruto inruenti dixisse: "kai su,
teknon?"  Exanimis, diffugientibus cunctis, aliquamdiu iacuit,
donec lecticae impositum, dependente bracchio, tres servoli domum
rettulerunt.  Nec in tot vulneribus, ut Antistius medicus
existimabat, letale ullum repertum est, nisi quod secundo loco in
pectore acceperat.

Illud plane inter omnes fere constitit, talem ei mortem paene ex
sententia obtigisse.  Nam et quondam, cum apud Xenophontem
legisset Cyrum ultima valetudine mandasse quaedam de funere suo,
aspernatus tam lentum mortis genus, subitam sibi celeremque
optaverat; et pridie quam occideretur, in sermone nato super
cenam apud Marcum Lepidum, quisnam esset finis vitae
commodissimus, repentinum inopinatumque praetulerat.


The assassination of Caesar

A conspiracy was made against Caesar by more than sixty men, with
Gaius Cassius and Marcus and Decimus Brutus the leaders.  And,
after the senate was called to convene in Pompey's curia on the
Ides of March, they offered up that time and place as the most
suitable.  When Caesar entered the curia and sat down, the
conspirators surrounded him with the appearance of duty;
Immediately Tillius Cimber, who had undertaken the leading role,
approached near as if about to ask something, and when Caesar
refused, and shrugged him off til another time, he grasped his
toga by both shoulders; then Caesar proclaimed "This indeed is
violence!", and one of the Casci wounded him from behind, a
little below the collarbone.  Caesar grabbed Cascus' forearm and
stabbed it with a stylus, but his attempt to get away was
forestalled by another wound; and when he saw that he was being
attacked from every side with drawn daggers, he covered his head
with his toga, and at the same time pulled the fold of his toga
down to his ankles with his left hand, by which he might fall
more respectably, keeping the lower part of his body covered.
And so with three and twenty wounds he was stabbed, only groaning
once at the first blow but not speaking, although certain men
related that he said to Marcus Brutus, when he attacked, "You
too, child?"  When everyone had scattered, he lay lifeless for
some time, until, laid on a litter with his arm hanging down,
three young slaves carried him home.  And among all those wounds,
as the doctor Antistius judged, not a mortal one was found,
except the second blow, which he'd received in the breast.

It was clearly agreed upon among nearly everyone that the sort of
death that had fallen to him was almost according to his wish.
For once, when he had read in Xenophon that in his final illness
Cyrus had commanded certain things regarding his own funeral,
scorning a slow kind of death so much that he would've chosen a sudden
and swift one for himself; and would sooner have been slain,
in a speech that came up over dinner at Marcus Lepidus', about
what might be the most suitable end of life, he had preferred a
sudden and unexpected one.


B. Ciceronis de Caesaris caede duae sententiae

CICERO BASILO SAL.
Tibi gratulor, mihi gaudeo; te amo, tua tueor;
a te amari et quid agas quidque agatur certior fieri volo.

CICERO ATTICO SAL.
Equidem doleo, quod numquam in ulla civitate accidit,
non una cum libertate rem publicam recuperatam.
Horribile est quae loquantur, quae minitentur.
Ac vereor Gallica etiam bella, ipse Sextus quo evadat.
Sed omnia licet concurrant, Idus Martiae consolantur.
Nostri autem heroes quod per ipsos confici potuit
gloriosissime et magnificentissime confecerunt;
reliquae res opes et copias desiderant, quas nullas habemus.


Two opinions of Cicero on Caesar's death

CICERO TO BASILUS, GREETINGS
I congratulate you, I rejoice for my own sake;
I love you, I protect your interests; I wish to be loved by you,
and to find out more about what you are doing and how it's going with you.

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETINGS
For my part, I grieve for what never happened in any city,
for a republic to be restored with even a single liberty.
It's terrible what they say, what they threaten.
And I also dread a war in Gaul, from which Sextus may himself escape.
But even if all else joins against us, let the Ides of March console us.
For because he could be killed through the efforts of our heroes,
they dispatched him most gloriously and magnificently;
the remaining matters require resources and wealth, which we have none of.
