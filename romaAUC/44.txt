Ciceronis proscripti mors

Marcus Cicero sub adventum triumvirorum urbe cesserat, certo habens
id quod erat, non magis se Antonio eripi quam Caesari Octaviano
Cassium et Brutum posse.  Primo in Tusculanum fugerat, inde
transversis itineribus in Formianum, ut ab Caieta navem
conscensurus, proficiscitur.  Unde aliquoties in altum provectum,
cum modo venti adversi retulissent, modo ipse iactationem navis,
caeco volvente fluctu, pati non posset, taedium tandem eum et fugae
et vitae cepit.  Regressusque ad superiorem villam, quae paulo plus
mille passibus a mari abest, "Moriar," inquit, "in patria saepe
servata."

Postero die autem a familiaribus ei persuasum est ut iterum fugam
experiretur, sed descendentem ad mare milites Antonii adsecuti
sunt.  Satis constat servos fortiter fideliterque paratos fuisse ad
dimicandum; ipsum deponi lecticam et quietos pati quod sors iniqua
cogeret iussisse.  Prominenti ex lectica praebentique immotam
cervicem, caput praecisum est.  Nec satis stolidae crudelitati
militum fuit; manus quoque scripsisse aliquid in Antonium
exprobrantes praeciderunt.  Ita relatum caput ad Antonium iussuque
eius inter duas manus in rostris positum, ubi ille consul, ubi
saepe consularis, ubi eo ipso anno adversus Antonium, quanta nulla
umquam humana vox cum admiratione eloquentiae, auditus fuerat.  Vix
attollentes prae lacrimis oculos, homines intueri trucidati membra
civis poterant.

Vixit tres et sexaginta annos, ut, si vis afuisset, ne immatura
quidem mors videri possit.  Ingenium et operibus et praemiis operum
felix; ipse fortunae diu prosperae; et in longo tenore felicitatis
magnis interdum ictus vulneribus -- exsilio, ruina partium pro
quibus steterat, filiae morte, exitu tam tristi atque acerbo --
omnium adversorum nihil ut viro dignum erat tulit praeter mortem;
quae vere aestimanti minus indigna videri potuit, quod a victore
inimico nil crudelius passurus erat, quam quod eiusdem fortunae
compos ipse fecisset.  Si quis tamen virtutibus vitia pensaret, vir
magnus ac memorabilis fuit, et in cuius laudes exsequendas Cicerone
laudatore opus fuerit.



The death of the outlawed Cicero

Marcus Cicero withdrew from the city just before the arrival of the
triumvirs, certainly holding that it was in fact true that he could
no more to be seized by Antony than Cassius and Brutus by Caesar
Octavius.  He first fled to Tusculanum, and from there set out
cross-country to Formianum, in order to take ship from Caieta.  He
took ship from there more than once, but the first time adverse
winds had forced him back, and then he himself couldn't bear the
motion of the ship, rocked by erratic waves, and in the end a
disgust of flight and of life took hold of him.  And he returned to
his last villa, which was a bit more than a mile from the sea, and
said, "I will die in the native land that I have often protected."

But on the next day he was convinced by his servants to attempt
flight again, but Antony's soldiers overtook him as he went down to
the sea.  It is generally agreed that his servants had been prepared
to fight, bravely and loyally; but that he himself ordered the
litter to be set down and his servants to quietly endure whatever an
unkind fate would compel.  When he leaned out of litter and
presented his motionless neck, his head was cut off.  But this was
not enough for the brutish barbarity of the soldiers; they also cut
off his hands, that had written something in reproach of Antony.
Thus, when they'd carried the head back to Antony and, on his
command, placed it between the two hands on the rostra, where he was
consul, where he'd often been consul, where that very year he had
spoken against Antony, heard with admiration of his eloquence -
greater than a mere human voice.  Men could barely lift up their
eyes for the tears, or gaze upon what was left of a fellow citizen.

He lived for sixty-three years, so that, had there been no
violence, it would not indeed have seemed an untimely death.  His
nature was blessed with both his works and the rewards of of his
works; he was long a man of good fortune; And in his long course of
great happiness, occassionally struck with misfortunes - exile, the
destruction of the factions for which he stood, the death of a
daughter, an end so sad and bitter - he bore none of all his
misfortunes as was worthy for a man except for death; and this
could seem less cruel to one who judges truly, because he would
have suffered nothing crueller from his triumphant foe, than what
he himself would have inflicted if he'd had the same fortune.  But
nevertheless, if anyone were to compare his faults with his
virtues, he was a great and remarkable man, and for carrying out
his praises there'd be need for another Cicero as eulogist.
