Ciceronis proscripti mors

Marcus Cicero sub adventum triumvirorum urbe cesserat, certo habens
id quod erat, non magis se Antonio eripi quam Caesari Octaviano
Cassium et Brutum posse.  Primo in Tusculanum fugerat, inde
transversis itineribus in Formianum, ut ab Caieta navem
conscensurus, proficiscitur.  Unde aliquoties in altum provectum,
cum modo venti adversi retulissent, modo ipse iactationem navis,
caeco volvente fluctu, pati non posset, taedium tandem eum et fugae
et vitae cepit.  Regressusque ad superiorem villam, quae paulo plus
mille passibus a mari abest, "Moriar," inquit, "in patria saepe
servata."

Postero die autem a familiaribus ei persuasum est ut iterum fugam experiretur,
sed descendentem ad mare milites Antonii adsecuti sunt.
Satis constat servos fortiter fideliterque paratos fuisse ad dimicandum;
ipsum deponi lecticam et quietos pati quod sors iniqua cogeret iussisse.
----------------
Prominenti ex lectica praebentique immotam cervicem, capul praecisum est. 12
Nec satis stolidae crudelitati militum fuit; 13
manus quoque scripsisse aliquid in Antonium exprobrantes praeciderunt.



The death of the outlawed Cicero

Marcus Cicero withdrew from the city just before the arrival of the
triumvirs, certainly holding that it was in fact true that he could
no more to be seized by Antony than Cassius and Brutus by Caesar
Octavius.  He first fled to Tusculanum, and from there set out
cross-country to Formianum, in order to take ship from Caieta.  He
took ship from there more than once, but the first time adverse
winds had forced him back, and then he himself couldn't bear the
motion of the ship, rocked by erratic waves, and in the end a
disgust of flight and of life took hold of him.  And he returned to
his last villa, which was a bit more than a mile from the sea, and
said, "I will die in the native land that I have often protected."

But on the next day he was convinced by his servants to attempt
flight again, but Antony's soldiers overtook him as he went down to
the sea.  It is generally agreed that his servants had been prepared
to fight, bravely and loyally; but that he himself ordered the
litter to be set down and his servants to quietly endure whatever an
unkind fate would compel.
