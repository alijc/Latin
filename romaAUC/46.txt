Bellum Actiacum

Antonius, cum contra Parthos profectus esset, fame et pestilentia
laborans pro victo recessit.  Expeditione repulsa, captus amore
Cleopatrae in regio se sinu reficiebat.  Ita mulier Aegyptia ab
ebrio imperatore pretium libidinum Romanum imperium petiit; et
promisit Antonius.  Hic igitur coepit non sibi dominationem parare
sed Cleopatrae; nec tacite, sed patriae, nominis, togae oblitus,
totus in monstrum illud ut mente ita victu quoque cultuque
desciverat: aureum in manu baculum, in latere acinaces, purpurea
vestis ingentibus obstricta gemmis; diadema tantum deerat ut
regina rex et ipse frueretur.  Crescente deinde amentia, bellum
patriae inferre constituit.  Regina igitur comitante, milites suos
regiasque naves ad Actium, Ambracii sinus promunturium, contraxit.

Ad primam horum novorum motuum famam Caesar Octavianus a Brundisio
traiecerat, ut venienti bello occurreret.  Advenit deinde maximi
discriminis dies, quo Caesar Antoniusque, productis classibus, pro
salute alter, in ruinam alter terrarum orbis apud Actium navali
proelio dimicavere.  In serum dimicatione protracta, prima
occupavit fugam Cleopatra.  Antonius fugientis reginae quam
pugnantis militis sui comes esse maluit, et imperator, qui in
desertores saevire debuerat, desertor exercitus sui factus est.

Proximo deinde anno Caesar Aegyptum petiit, obsessaque Alexandria,
quo Antonius cum Cleopatra confugerat, brevi potitus est.
Antonius quidem seras condiciones pacis frustra temptans, se ipse
non segniter interemit, adeo ut multa desidiae crimina morte
redimeret.  At Cleopatra ad pedes Caesaris provoluta temptavit
oculos ducis; sed nequiquam, nam pulchritudo eius infra pudicitiam
principis fuit.  Nec illa de vita, quae offerebatur, sed de parte
regni laborabat.  Quod ubi desperavit et Caesarem se triumpho
servare magno opere cupere vidit, incautiorem nancta custodiam, in
mausoleum (sepulchra regum sic vocant) se recepit.  Ibi
ornatissimos, ut solebat, induta cultus in referto odoribus
sarcophago iuxta suum se collocavit Antonium et, inlata aspide,
morsu eius, expers muliebris metus, spiritum reddidit.  Caesar
ambobus communem sepulturae honorem tribuit ac tumulum ab ipsis
incohatum perfici iussit.  Sic ultimam bellis civilibus imposuit
manum.  Fuitque et fortuna et clementia Caesaris dignum, quod nemo
ex eis qui contra eum arma tulerant ab eo iussuve eius interemptus
est.


The Battle of Actium

After Antony set out against the Parthians, he retreated, troubled
with hunger and pestilence, as if in defeat.  With the expedition
driven back and captivated with love for Cleopatra, he restored
himself in the royal lap.  So the mistress of Egypt sought the
Roman empire from a drunken commander as a reward for her
licentiousness; and Antony promised it.  Hence he set about to
obtain domination not for himself, but for Cleopatra; and not
secretly, but forgetting his homeland, name, and culture, entirely
for that monster, as in his mind he had deserted both his way of
life and his attire as well: with a gold staff in his hand, a
scimitar at his side, a purple garment bound with enormous gems;
only wanting a crown for him to enjoy, as a king, his queen.
Then, with growing folly, he decided to embark on a war with his
homeland.  And so, in the company of the queen, he assembled his
soldiers and royal ships at Actium, the headland of the bay of
Ambracium.


At the first report of this new disturbance, Caesar Octavianus had
crossed over from Brundisium to rush to meet the approaching war.
He arrived from there on the day of the greatest crisis, on which
Caesar and Antony led out their fleets and fought in a naval
battle before Actium.  One strove for the prosperity, and the
other the ruination of the world.  After the combat extended til
late evening, Cleopatra took flight first.  Antony chose the
fleeing queen over his fighting comrade soldier, and the general,
who should have raged against desertors, became a desertor from
his own army.

Then the next year, Caesar attacked Egypt and besieged and quickly
seized Alexandria, where Antony had taken refuge with Cleopatra.
Indeed, after trying too late and in vain for a peace proposal,
Antony half-heartedly did away with himself, to truly repay many
charges of indolence by his death.  But Cleopatra, prostrated at
Caesar's feet, tempted the commander's eyes; but in vain, for her
beauty was less than the prince's purity.  She wasn't even
striving for her life, which he'd already bestowed, but for a
portion of her royal power.  Because when she despaired and saw
that Caesar greatly desired to preserve her for his triumph, after
she got an incautious guard, she withdrew to the mausoleum (what
they call the royal tomb).  There, clothed in the most richly
adorned fineries, as she was accustomed, she lay down in a coffin
replete with scent next to her Antony, and, with an asp that had
been brought in for its sting, she rendered her spirit, free from
womanly dread.  Caesar granted the honor of a common burial to
them both and ordered that a tomb that had been begun by them
should be completed.  Thus he put an end to the civil wars.  And
both the fortune and clemency of Caesar was merited, because none
of those who bore arms against him were killed by his order.
