Praefatio Annalium Cornelii Taciti

Urbem Romam a principio reges habuere; libertatem et consulatum
L. Brutus instituit.  Dictaturae ad tempus sumebantur; neque
decemviralis potestas ultra biennium, neque tribunorum militum
consulare ius diu valuit.  Non Cinnae, non Sullae longa
dominatio; et Pompeii Crassique potentia cito in Caesarem, Lipidi
atque Antonii arma in Augustum cessere, qui cuncta discordiis
civilibus fessa, nomine principis, sub imperium accepit.

Sed veteris populi Romani prospera vel adversa claris
scriptoribus memorata sunt; temporibusque Augusti dicendis non
defuere decora ingenia, donec gliscente adulatione deterrerentur.
Tiberii Gaiique et Claudii ac Neronis res, florentibus ipsis, ob
metum falsae, postquam occiderant, recentibus odiis compositae
sunt.  Inde consilium mihi pauca de Augusto et extrema tradere,
mox Tiberii principatum et cetera, sine ira et studio, quorum
causas procul habeo.


Postquam, Bruto et Cassio caesis, nulla iam publica arma,
Pompeius apud Siciliam oppressus, exutoque Lepido, interfecto Antonio,
ne Iulianis quidem partibus nisi Caesar dux reliquus;
posito triumviri nomine, consulem se ferens et ad tuendam plebem tribunicio iure contentum,
ubi militem donis, populum annona, cunctos dulcedine otii pellexit,
insurgere paulatim, munia senatus, magistratuum, legum, in se trahere,
nullo adversante, cum ferocissimi per acies aut proscriptione cecidissent,
ceteri nobilium, quanto quis servitio promptior, opibus et honoribus extollerentur
ac, novis ex rebus aucti, tuta et praesentia quam vetera et periculosa mallent.
Neque provinciae illum rerum statum abnuebant,
suspecto senatus populique imperio,
ob certamina potentium et avaritiam magistratuum,
invalido legum auxilio, quae vi, ambitu, postremo pecunia turbabantur.

Bellum ea tempestate nullum nisi adversus Germanos supererat,
abolendae magis infamiae ob amissum cum Quintilio Varo exercitum
quam cupidine proferendi imperii aut dignum ob praemium.
Domi res tranquillae, eadem magistratuum vocabula;
iuniores post Actiacam victoriam, etiam senes plerique inter bella civium nati;
quotus quisque reliquus qui rem publicam vidisset?


Preface to the Annals of Cornelius Tacitus

In the beginning the city of Rome had kings; But L. Brutus gave
it freedom and the consulship.  Dictatorships were accepted on
occasion; but the power of a decemvir didn't last beyond a
two-year period, nor did the rule of military tribunes last for
long.  The domination of neither Cinna and nor Sulla took long;
and the power of Pompey and Crassus quickly passed to Caesar, the
arms of Lipidus and Antony to Augustus, who, with the title of
Princeps, took everything, worn out in civil discords, under his
command.

But the triumphs and adversities of the ancient Roman people were
remembered by illustrious writers; and in describing the times of
Augustus honorable talents were not lacking, until they were to
be discouraged by swelling adulation.  The affairs of Tiberius
and Gaius and Claudius and Nero, while they flourished, were
falsified out of fear, and, after they'd died, were made up from
recent hatreds.  Due to that my plan is to relate only a little
about Augustus and that from the end of his life, then the rule
of Tiberius and the rest, without anger and zeal, the causes for
which I hold far off.



Afterwards, with Brutus and Cassius stuck down, no longer public arms,
Pompey overthrown on Sicily, with Lepidus cast off, Antony killed,
not even a single leader remaining for the Julian party except Caesar;
having put aside the title of triumvir, presenting himself as consul,
content with protecting the plebs through tribunal law,
whereby he won over the soldier with gifts, the people with provisions,
and everyone with sweetness and ease,
he gradually grew in power, taking upon himself the duties of the senate,
the magistrates, and the laws,
with no-one opposing him,
after the fiercest men had been struck down through battles or proscription,
since the rest of the nobles, by however much each was ready for slavery,
could be lifted up by wealth and honors and
made wealthier from this new property, prefered the safe present days
over the dangerous olden times.
Nor did the provinces reject that state of affairs,
with the authority of the senate and the people looked up to,
on account of the rivalries of powerful men and the greed of the magistrates,
from the feeble aid of laws, that were thrown into confusion
by violence, solicitation, and in the end, bribery.

There was no war left at the time except against the Germans,
more for the sake of obliterating the disgrace of losing Quintilius Varus' army
than for the desire of advancing the empire or for the sake of a worthy prize.
At home things were quiet, the same names of the magistrates;
the younger men were born after the victory at Actium,
even most of their elders were born among the civil wars;
how few remained who'd seen the republic?
