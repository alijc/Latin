Praefatio Annalium Cornelii Taciti

Urbem Romam a principio reges habuere; libertatem et consulatum
L. Brutus instituit.  Dictaturae ad tempus sumebantur; neque
decemviralis potestas ultra biennium, neque tribunorum militum
consulare ius diu valuit.  Non Cinnae, non Sullae longa
dominatio; et Pompeii Crassique potentia cito in Caesarem, Lipidi
atque Antonii arma in Augustum cessere, qui cuncta discordiis
civilibus fessa, nomine principis, sub imperium accepit.

Sed veteris populi Romani prospera vel adversa claris
scriptoribus memorata sunt; temporibusque Augusti dicendis non
defuere decora ingenia, donec gliscente adulatione deterrerentur.
Tiberii Gaiique et Claudii ac Neronis res, florentibus ipsis, ob
metum falsae, postquam occiderant, recentibus odiis compositae
sunt.  Inde consilium mihi pauca de Augusto et extrema tradere,
mox Tiberii principatum et cetera, sine ira et studio, quorum
causas procul habeo.

Postquam, Bruto et Cassio caesis, nulla iam publica arma,
Pompeius apud Siciliam oppressus, exutoque Lepido, interfecto
Antonio, ne Iulianis quidem partibus nisi Caesar dux reliquus;
posito triumviri nomine, consulem se ferens et ad tuendam plebem
tribunicio iure contentum, ubi militem donis, populum annona,
cunctos dulcedine otii pellexit, insurgere paulatim, munia
senatus, magistratuum, legum, in se trahere, nullo adversante,
cum ferocissimi per acies aut proscriptione cecidissent, ceteri
nobilium, quanto quis servitio promptior, opibus et honoribus
extollerentur ac, novis ex rebus aucti, tuta et praesentia quam
vetera et periculosa mallent.  Neque provinciae illum rerum
statum abnuebant, suspecto senatus populique imperio, ob
certamina potentium et avaritiam magistratuum, invalido legum
auxilio, quae vi, ambitu, postremo pecunia turbabantur.

Bellum ea tempestate nullum nisi adversus Germanos supererat,
abolendae magis infamiae ob amissum cum Quintilio Varo exercitum
quam cupidine proferendi imperii aut dignum ob praemium.  Domi
res tranquillae, eadem magistratuum vocabula; iuniores post
Actiacam victoriam, etiam senes plerique inter bella civium nati;
quotus quisque reliquus qui rem publicam vidisset?


Preface to the Annals of Cornelius Tacitus

In the beginning the city of Rome had kings; But L. Brutus gave
it freedom and the consulship.  Dictatorships were accepted on
occasion; but the power of a decemvir didn't last beyond a
two-year period, nor did the rule of military tribunes last for
long.  The domination of neither Cinna and nor Sulla took long;
and the power of Pompey and Crassus quickly passed to Caesar, the
arms of Lipidus and Antony to Augustus, who, with the title of
Princeps, took everything, worn out in civil discords, under his
command.

But the triumphs and adversities of the ancient Roman people were
remembered by illustrious writers; and in describing the times of
Augustus honorable talents were not lacking, until they were to
be discouraged by swelling adulation.  The affairs of Tiberius
and Gaius and Claudius and Nero, while they flourished, were
falsified out of fear, and, after they'd died, were made up from
recent hatreds.  Due to that my plan is to relate only a little
about Augustus and that from the end of his life, then the rule
of Tiberius and the rest, without anger and zeal, the causes for
which I hold far off.



After Brutus and Cassius were stuck down, there was no longer a
state army, Pompey was overthrown on Sicily, and with Lepidus
cast off and Antony killed, not even a single leader was left for
the Julian party but Caesar (Octavian).  He put aside the title
of triumvir, presenting himself as a consul, who was content with
protecting the plebs through tribunal law, whereby he won over
the soldier with gifts, the people with grain, and everyone with
the sweetness of leisure.  He gradually grew in power, taking
upon himself the duties of the senate, the magistrates, and the
laws.  No one opposed him, since the boldest men had been struck
down in battle or through proscription, while the rest of the
nobles, as much as each was ready for slavery, could be lifted up
by wealth and honors and made richer by this new property,
preferred the safe present days over the dangerous olden times.
Nor did the provinces reject that state of affairs, mistrusting
the authority of the senate and the people, on account of the
rivalries of powerful men and the greed of the magistrates, and
with the feeble assistance of the laws, thrown into disarray by
violence, corruption, and, in the end, bribery.

There was no war left at the time except against the Germans,
more for the sake of obliterating the disgrace of losing
Quintilius Varus' army than for the desire of advancing the
empire or for the sake of a worthy prize.  At home things were
quiet, with the designations of the magistrates unchanged; the
younger men were born after the victory at Actium, even most of
their elders were born among the civil wars; how few remained
who'd seen the republic?
