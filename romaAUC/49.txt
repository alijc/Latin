Aeneas, in Latium advectus, Latinos bello superat

Tunc lucos petit Aeneas, ubi nubilus umbra
in mare cum flava prorumpit Thybris harena;
Faunigenaeque domo potitur nataque Latini,
non sine Marte tamen.* Bellum cum gente feroci
suscipitur, pactaque furit pro coniuge Turnus.
Concurrit Latio Tyrrhenia tota,$ diuque
ardua sollicitis victoria quaeritur armis.
Auget uterque suas externo robore vires;
et multi Rutulos, multi Troiana tuentur
moenia. Habetque deos pars utraque, quodque deorum est
instar, habent animos. Nec iam dotalia regna
nec sceptrum soceri nec te, Lavinia virgo,
sed vicisse petunt; deponendique pudore
bella gerunt.  Tandemque Venus victricia nati
arma videt, Turnusque cadit; cadit Ardea, Turno
sospite dicta potens.


Aeneas, after traveling to Latium, conquers the Latins in war

Then Aeneas makes for the sacred groves, where, clouded over with shade,
Thybris rushes forth into the sea with yellow sand;
and gains possession of the ancient house of Faunus-descended Latinus, 
but not without Mars.  He undertakes a war with a fierce tribe,
and Turnus rages for his promised wife.
All of Etruria rushes to Latinus, and 
an arduous victory is long sought with troubled arms.
each side adds to their own forces with foreign strength;
and many protect the Rutulians, many protect the Trojan walls.
And each side has the gods, and what is the equal of the gods,
they have courage. And now no longer the dower kingdom
nor his father-in-law's scepter nor you, virgin Lavinia,
but they desire to have conquered; and with the shame of laying aside war,
they wage war. And finally he sees the conquering arms born of Venus,
and Turnus falls; as does Ardea, 
said to be powerful when Turnus was alive and well.
