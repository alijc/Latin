Servii Tullii omen, regnum, caedes

Cum Servius Tullius in domo Tarquinii Prisci educaretur, flammae
species caput eius amplexa est.  Hoc visu Tanaquil regina summam
dignitatem puero portendi intellexit.  Servius igitur gener a
Tarquinio adsumptus est.  Cum autem rex occisus esset, Tanaquil,
mortem coniugis dissimulans, populum Servio Tullio dicto audientem
esse iussit.  Servius recte imperium administravit; urbem muro
cinxit; populum in quattuor tribus atque in classes centuriasque
distribuit.

Filiam autem alteram ferocem, mitem alteram habens, cum Tarquinii
filios pari animo videret, ut omnium mentes morum diversitate
leniret, ferocem miti, mitem feroci in matrimonium dedit.  Sed
mites seu forte seu fraude perierunt; feroces morum similitudo
coniunxit.  Statim Tarquinius Superbus a Tullia uxore incitatus,
advocato senatu, regnum patrium repetere coepit.  Qua re audita,
Servius, dum ad curiam properat, iussu Tarquinii de gradibus
deiectus et, domum refugiens, interfectus est.  Tullia interea in
Forum properavit et prima coniugem regem salutavit, a quo iussa ex
turba decedere, cum domum rediret, viso patris corpore, mulionem
evitantem super ipsum corpus carpentum agere praecepit.  Unde vicus
ille Sceleratus dictus est.


The omen, kingdom and fall of Servius Tullius

When Servius Tullius was being raised in the house of Tarquin
Priscus, a vision of flame encircled his head.  At this sight Queen
Tanaquil realized that the utmost worth was foretold for the boy.
And so Servius was adopted by Tarquin as his son-in-law.  But when
the king was killed, Tanaquil, concealing the death of her husband,
ordered her people to obey Servius Tullius.  Servius managed the
state properly; he enclosed the city with wall; he divided the
people into four tribes and into classes and centuries.

Now he had one daughter who was fierce, and a second one who was
mild, and since he saw that Tarquin's sons were of like
temperament, in order to mollify the minds of each by a difference
of character, he wed the fierce one to the mild one, and the mild
one to the fierce one.  But the meek ones, either by chance or by
crime, passed away, and their likeness of character united the
fierce ones.  At once Tarquin the Proud, urged on by his wife
Tullia, summoned the senate and commenced to reclaim his father's
kingdom.  And when he heard of this, Servius, as he hurried to the
Curia, was thrown down the steps by order of Tarquin and, fleeing
home, was killed.  Tullia meanwhile hurried to the Forum and was
first to hail her spouse as king, and was ordered by him to
withdraw from the turmoil.  When she returned home and saw her
father's body, she ordered a hesitant mule-driver to take the
corpse away on his wagon.  From which that street was called
Sceleratus (Criminal).
