Tullia virum exstimulat

Tullia, coniugio sceleris mercede parato,
 his solita est dictis exstimulare virum:
"Quid iuvat esse pares-te nostrae caede sororis
 meque tui fratris-si pia vita placet?
Vivere debuerant et vir meus et tua coniunx,
 si nullum ausuri maius eramus opus.
Regia res scelus est; socero cape regna necato,
 et nostras patrio sanguine tingue manus."
Talibus instinctus, solio privatus in alto
 sederat. Attonitum vulgus ad arma ruit.
Hinc cruor et caedes, infirmaque vincitur aetas.
 Sceptra gener socero rapta Superbus habet.
Ipse, sub Esquiliis (ubi erat sua regia) caesus,
 concidit in dura sanguinolentus humo.
Filia carpento, patrios initura penates,
 ibat per medias alta feroxque vias.
 Corpus ut aspexit, lacrimis auriga profusis
  restitit. Hunc tali corripit illa sono:
"Vadis? An expectas pretium pietatis amarum?
 Duc, inquam, invitas ipsa per ora rotas."
Certa fides facti: dictus Sceleratus ab illa
 vicus, et aeterna res ea pressa nota.


Tullia goads her husband

Tullia, with her marriage furnished as the reward of crime,
 was wont to goad her husband with these words:
"What good is it to be partners - you of my sister's murder
 and me of your brother's - if an upright life gives pleasure?
Both my husband and your wife ought to have lived,
 had we not dared the greater deed.
Crime is a royal affair; kill your father-in-law and seize the kingdom,
 and stain our hands with paternal blood."
Fired up by such words, a private citizen sat upon the high throne.
 The astonished public fell to arms.
From this comes bloodshed and slaughter, and frail old age is overcome.
 The Proud son-in-law holds the scepters carried off from his father-in-law.
He, cut down under the Esquiline (where his palace was),
 fell unto the hard ground, stained with blood.
His tall fierce daughter, on her way to enter her father's home,
 was going through the middle of the streets in a carriage.
As her driver saw the corpse, with poured-out tears he
 paused. She chastised him with such a noise:
"Are you going on? Or are you waiting for the bitter reward for pity?
 Guide, I say, the unwilling wheels across his very face."
There is sure proof of the deed: the street's called Wicked after her,
 and the affair was stamped with an eternal note of infamy.
