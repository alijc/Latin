Aeneae clipei non enarrabile textum

Illic res Italas Romanorumque triumphos 
haud vatum ignarus venturique inscius aevi
fecerat Ignipotens, illic genus omne futurae
stirpis ab Ascanio pugnataque in ordine bella.
Fecerat et viridi fetam Mavortis in antro
procubuisse lupam, geminos huic ubera circum
ludere pendentis pueros et lambere matrem
impavidos, illam tereti cervice reflexa
mulcere alternos et corpora fingere lingua.
Nec non Tarquinium eiectum Porsenna iubebat
accipere ingentique urbem obsidione premebat.
Aeneadae in ferrum pro libertate ruebant.
Illum indignanti similem similemque minanti
aspiceres, pontem auderet quia vellere Cocles.
In summo custos Tarpeiae Manlius arcis 
stabat pro templo et Capitolia celsa tenebat.
Atque hic auratis volitans argenteus anser
porticibus Gallos in limine adesse canebat:
Galli per dumos aderant arcemque tenebant, 
defensi tenebris et dono noctis opacae.
Aurea caesaries illis atque aurea vestis;
virgatis lucent sagulis; tum lactea colla
auro innectuntur;  duo quisque Alpina coruscant
gaesa manu, scutis protecti corpora longis.


The fabric of Aeneas' shield is beyond description

There the God of Fire, not unaware of prophets or ignorant of time,
had fashioned Italian events and Roman triumphs,
there each offspring of the future race of Ascanius
in a line, with wars that were fought.
He'd also fashioned a newly whelped she-wolf,
lying in the verdant hollow of Mars,
twin boys playing around her hanging teats
and sucking, fearless, and that dam,
with her tapering neck bent back,
fondling each in turn and molding their bodies with her tongue.
And also Porsenna ordered Tarquinius to be cast out
and overwhelmed the city, taken in a mighty siege.
Aeneas' descendants threw themselves onto iron for the sake of liberty.
You might have seen him, like one scornful and one threatening,
since Horatio dared to demolish the bridge.
On the top Manlius, guardian of the citadel of Tarquina
stood before the temple and preserved the lofty Capitol.
And here a silver goose flying through gilded
colonnades was crowing that the Gauls were on the threshold.
The Gauls approached through thorns and were about to seize the citadel,
protected by gloom and the gift of dark night.
Golden hair they had, and golden garments;
they shine in striped cloaks; then milk-white throats
are encircled in gold; each brandishes in his handtwo
Alpine spears, their bodies protected by long shields.
