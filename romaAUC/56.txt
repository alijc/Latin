Alter consul tandem de plebe creatus

Refecti decumum tribuni, Sextius et Licinius de decemviris sacrorum
ex parte de plebe creandis legem pertulere.
Creatis quinque patrum, quinque plebis,
gradu eo iam via facta ad consulatum videbatur.
Hac igitur victoria contenta,
plebs cessit patribus ut, in praesentia consulum mentione omissa,
tribuni militum consulari cum potestate rursus crearentur.

Eodem anno fama repens belli Gallici perpulit civitatem ut Marcus Furius
 dictator quintum diceretur.
Signis cum Gallis conlatis, nec dubia nec difficilis Romanis,
quamquam ingentem Galli terrorem memoria pristinae cladis attulerant,
victoria fuit.
Sed vixdum perfunctum Furium bello atrocior domi seditio excepit.
Et per ingentia certamina dictator senatusque victi sunt,
ut rogationes tribuniciae acciperentur.
Cum igitur comitia consulum adversa nobilitate habita essent,
Lucius Sextius primus de plebe consul factus est.
Sed ne is quidem finis certaminum fuit. Quia patricii se auctores futuros esse negabant, prope secessionem plebis res veniebat, 13 cum tandem, con dicionibus a dictatore propositis, sedatae discordiae sunt.14 Concessum est ab nobilitate plebi de consule plebeio; a plebe nobilitati de praetore, qui ius in urbe diceret, ex patribus creando. 15 Ita ab diutina ira tandem in concordiam redactis ordinibus, 16 dignam eam rem senatus censuit esse ut gratiae deis immortalibus merito agerentur.17


Another of the common people finally made consul

After Sextius and Licinius were restored as tribunes for the tenth time,
they enacted a law on the creation of a board for sacred rites,
partly from the common people.
Five patricians and five commoners were appointed to it,
and by this step it seemed that a path was now created to the consulship.
And so, with this victory secured,
the common people submitted to the patricians so that,
with the present naming of consuls having been passed over,
military tribunes were once again created with consular power.

In the same year the sudden news of a Gallic war compelled the city
to appoint Marcus Furius as dictator, for the fifth time.
In the clash with the Gauls,
victory was neither doubtful nor difficult for the Romans,
although the Gauls produced great fear, due to the memory of a former defeat.
But Furius had barely been discharged by the war when a more savage rebellion at
home drew him back.
And in a momentous battle the dictator and the senate were defeated,
so that the proposed tribunical measures could be passed.
And so when the election of consuls was held, with the nobility in opposition,
Lucius Sextius was the first commoner created consul.
