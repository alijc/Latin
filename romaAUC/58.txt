Colloquium inter Hannibalem et Scipionem fictum

Submotis pari spatio armatis, cum singulis interpretibus Hannibal
et Scipio congressi sunt, non suae modo aetatis maximi duces, sed
omnis ante se memoriae.  Paulisper alter alterius conspectu,
admiratione mutua prope attoniti, conticuere.  Tum Hannibal
prior: "Quoniam hoc ita fato datum erat, ut qui primus bellum
intuli populo Romano, quique totiens prope in manibus victoriam
habui, is ultro ad pacem petendam venirem, laetor te mihi sorte
potissimum datum, a quo peterem.  Quod ad me attinet, iam aetas,
senem in patriam revertentem unde puer profectus sum, iam
secundae, iam adversae res ita erudierunt, ut rationem sequi quam
fortunam malim; tuam et adulescentiam et perpetuam felicitatem
metuo.  Non temere incerta casuum reputat, quem fortuna numquam
decepit.  Quod ego fui ad Trasumennum, ad Cannas, id tu hodie es.
Potest victoriam malle quam pacem animus.  Novi spiritus magnos
magis quam utiles; et mihi talis aliquando fortuna adfulsit.
Quod si in secundis rebus bonam quoque mentem darent di, non ea
solum quae evenissent, sed etiam ea quae evenire possent,
reputaremus.  Melior tutiorque est certa pax quam sperata
victoria; haec in tua, illa in deorum manu est."


A made-up conversation between Hannibal and Scipio

While the soldiers were kept at an equal distance, Hannibal and
Scipio met, each with an interpreter, the greatest commanders not
only of their own generation, but of all of history prior to
them.  At the sight of each other, briefly amost stupified with
mutual admiration, they were silent.  Then Hannibal spoke first:
"Since this was fated to happen, that I, who first brought war to
the Roman people, and who so often nearly held victory in my
hands, should be the one to come and ask for peace, of my own
free will, I rejoice that you in particular were given to be the
one I should ask it of.  As far as it concerns me, first a
lifetime, an old man returning to my native land from whence I
departed as a boy, then favorable, then adverse things have
taught me to follow prudence over fortune; I fear both your youth
and your constant good luck.  One whom fortune has never deceived
does not rashly reflect on the uncertainty of what may befall
one.  What I was at Trasumennus, at Cannae, is what you are
today.  The heart may prefer victory to peace.  I know that acts
of courage are more noble than useful ones; and such fortune has
sometimes smiled upon me.  But if in what follows the gods
likewise give good judgment, we should reflect on not only what
happened, but also what might happen.  A sure peace is better and
safer than a hoped for victory; one is in your hands, while the
other is in the hands of the gods."
