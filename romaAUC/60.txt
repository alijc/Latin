Versus ex Ennii Annalibus

Verses from Ennius' Annals

Á. Pectora dulce tenet desiderium, simul inter
   sese sic memorant: "O Romule, Romule die,
   qualem te patriae custodem di genuerunt! 
   O pater, O genitor, O sanguen dis oriundum,
   tu produxisti nos intra luminis oras!"

Longing held delightful breasts, while among
themselves they thus recounted: "O Romulus, divine Romulus,
what a fine guardian of the fatherland did the gods beget in you!
O father, O creator, O blood springing from the gods,
you have led us forward within the shores of light!"

B. Nec mi aurum posco nec mi pretium dederitis;
   nec cauponantes bellum sed belligerantes,
   ferro non auro vitam cernamus utrique.
   Vosne velit an me regnare era, quidve ferat, Fors,
   virtute experiamur. Et hoc simul accipe dictum:
   quorum virtuti belli fortuna pepercit, 
   eorundem libertati me parcere certum est.
   Dono—ducite—doque, volentibus cum magnis dis.

I do not ask for gold, nor ought you grant me reward;
not bartering war but waging it,
let both of us decide life by iron, not by gold.
Let's prove through our courage whether Mistress Chance
would prefer you or me to rule, whatever she may bring.
And hear this speech as well:
of those whose courage in war fortune has spared,
it is settled that I will spare the liberty of the same.
This I grant (lead them away), the great gods willing.

C. Postquam Discordia taetra
   belli ferratos postes portasque refregit,
   pellitur e medio sapientia, vi geritur res,
   spernitur orator bonus, horridis miles amatur.
   Haud doctis dictis certantes, sed maledictis,
   miscent inter sese, inimicitias agitantes.
   Non ex iure manum consertum; sed magis ferro
   rem repetunt regnumque petunt; vadunt solida vi.

After foul Discord
broke open the ironclad doorposts and gates of war,
wisdom was driven out from their midst, the matter was carried by force,
the honest orator was despised and the soldier loved by frightful men.
By no means vying with learned words, but with insults,
they mingle together, stirring up hostilities.
There are no legal handshakes;
they demand the business again and attack authority with steel;
they advance with rigid violence.


D. Hannibal audaci dum pectore de me hortatur
   ne bellum faciam, quem credidit esse meum cor 
   suasorem summum et studiosum robore belli.

E. Moribus antiquis res stat Romana virisque.

F. 	   	    	stolidum genus Aeacidarum
   bellipotentes sunt magis quam sapientipotentes.

G. Musae quae pedibus magnum pulsatis Olympum.

H. O Tite tute Tati tibi tanta tyranne tulisti! 28

I. Africa terribili tremit horrida terra tumultu.29



D. Hannibal, though bold of heart, dissuades me
   from making war, he whom my heart believed was
   my best advisor and eager in his resolve for war.

E. With its ancient character and its men, the Roman matter stands firm.

F.    	  	  	    the stupid race of Aeacus
   the mighty in war are greater than the mighty in wisdom.

G. Muses, who beat your feet on great Olympus.

H. O Titus Tatius, you tyrant, you brought such things upon yourself!

I. Africa, a grim land, trembles with terrible commotion.
