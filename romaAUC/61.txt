Vergilius Ennii imitator

Vergil, imitator of Ennius

=====================================================

A. Incedunt arbusta per alta, securibus caedunt;
   percellunt magnas quercus. Exciditur ilex; 
   fraxinus frangitur atque abies consternitur alta.
   Pinus proceras pervortunt. Omne sonabat
   arbustum fremitu silvai frondosai.

Quos versus imitatus est Vergilius in sexto Aeneidos:

   Itur in antiquam silvam, stabula alta ferarum.‚Åπ
   Procumbunt piceae; sonat icta securibus ilex
   fraxineaeque trabes cuneis; et fissile robur
   scinditur; advolvunt ingentes montibus ornos.


A. They march through the tall groves, they fell them with axes;
   they strike the great oaks down. The scarlet oak is destroyed;
   the ash shatters and the tall fir is brought down.
   They destroy the lofty pines. The copse resounds
   with each crash of the leafy woods.

Vergil imitated these lines in the sixth book of the Aeneid:

   It comes to pass in the ancient forest, among the high lairs of wild beasts.
   The pitch-pines fall down; the scarlet oak resounds, struck by axes
   and ash beams with wedges; and the oak is easily
   split; they roll huge ash trees down from the hills.

=====================================================

B. Unus homo nobis cunctando restituit rem.
   Noenum rumores ponebat ante salutem.
   Ergo postque magisque viri nunc gloria claret,

Quos versus imitatus est Vergilius etiam in sexto Aeneidos:

     	    	     	 	   Tu Maximus ille es,
   unus qui nobis cunctando restituis rem. 16


B. One man, by delaying, restored the republic for us.
   He did not place rumors before our safety.
   Therefore since then and even more today he shines in strength and glory,

Vergil imitated these lines in the sixth book of the Aeneid as well:

       		      	       	   You, Maximus, are he,
   the one who saves the republic for us by delaying.

=====================================================
C.  Undique conveniunt velut imber tela tribuno; 
    configunt parmam. Tinnit hastilibus umbo;
    aerato sonitu galeae.  Sed nec pote quisquam
    undique nitendo corpus discerpere ferro.
    Semper adundantes hastas frangitque quatitque.
    Totum sudor habet corpus; multumque laborat; 
    nec respirandi fit copia. Praepete ferro
    Histri tela manu iacientes sollicitabant,

Quos versus Vergilius de incluso Turno in nono Aeneidos gratia
elegantiore imitatus est:

    Ergo nec clipeo iuvenis subsistere tantum
    nec dextra valet, iniectis sic undique telis
    obruitur.  Strepit adsiduo cava tempora circum
    tinnitu galea, 28 et saxis solida aera fatiscunt, 29
    discussaeque iubae capiti,30 nec sufficit umbo
    ictibus. 31 Ingeminant hastis et Troes et ipse
    fulmineus Mnestheus. 32 Tum toto corpore sudor
    liquitur 33 et piceum (nec respirare potestas)
    flumen agit; 34 fessos quatit aeger anhelitus artus, 35

C.  From every side the spears converge, like rain, towards the tribune; 
    they pierce his shield; Its boss clangs with spears;
    his helmet with brassy clangs. But it is not possible for anyone,
    pressing on him from every side, to mangle his body with iron.
    He breaks the constant waves of spears and shakes them from his shield.
    Sweat covers his whole body; and he labors hard;
    he has no chance to draw a breath. With flying iron
    the Istrians, casting javelins by hand, stirred up...

Vergil imitated these lines with elegant grace in the ninth book of the Aeneid,
writing about the trapped Turnus.

    And so not with his shield can the young man make a stand,
    nor with his right hand either, with javelins cast from every side thus
    he is buried.
