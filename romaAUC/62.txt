Eloquentia Gracchorum

Gracchorum eloquentiae multum contulisse accepimus Corneliam matrem,
cuius doctissimus sermo in posteros quoque est epistulis traditus.
Ex eis enim apparet filios non tam in gremio educatos quam in
sermone matris.  Utinam in Tiberio Graccho talis mens ad rem
publicam bene gerendam fuisset, quale ingenium ad bene dicendum
fuit; profecto nemo huic viro gloria praestitisset.  Sed propter
turbulentissimum tribunatum ab ipsa re publica est interfectus.
Fuit tamen summus orator.  Atque hoc memoria patrum teste dicimus;
nam Gracchi habemus orationes nondum satis splendidas verbis, sed
acutas prudentiaeque plenissimas.  Fuit Gracchus diligentia
Corneliae matris a puero doctus et Graecis litteris eruditus.  Nam
semper habuit exquisitos e Graecia magistros, in eis Diophanem
Mytilenaeum, Graeciae temporibus illis disertissimum.  Sed ei breve
tempus ingeni augendi et declarandi fuit.

Fuit autem vir et praestantissimo ingenio et flagranti studio et doctus a
puero C. Gracchus.  Noli enim putare quemquam pleniorem aut uberiorem ad
dicendum fuisse.  Damnum vero illius immaturo interitu res Romanae
Latinaeque litterae fecerunt.  Utinam non tam fratri pietatem quam patriae
praestare voluisset!  Quam ille facile tali ingenio, diutius si vixisset,
vel paternam esset vel avitam gloriam consecutus!  Eloquentia quidem
nescio an habuisset parem neminem.  Grandis est verbis, sapiens
sententiis, genere toto gravis.  Manus extrema non accessit operibus eius;
praeclare incohata multa, perfecta non plane.  Legendus autem est hic
orator, si quisquam alius, iuventuti; non enim solum acuere sed etiam
alere ingenium potest.



The eloquence of the Gracchi

We have heard that much of the eloquence of the Gracchi was
bestowed by their mother Cornelia, whose learned discourse is
related among later generations and also in letters.  For these showed
that she could prepare educated sons, not so much from a mother's physical
care as from her conversation.  If only Tiberius Gracchus had had as
much intellect for governing the republic as he had talent for
speaking well; theb surely no-one would have surpassed this man in
renown.  But due to a turbulent tribuneship he was destroyed by
the republic itself.  Yet he was the ultimate orator.  And we say
this by the testimony of our fathers; for we hold that the speeches of
Gracchus are not only splendid in words, but also wise and full
of good sense.  From the diligence of his mother Cornelia, Gracchus
was from a boy taught and educated in Greek literature.  For he
always had excellent teachers from Greece, Diophanes of Mytilenae,
the most eloquent man of the Greeks in those times, among them.  But
he had little time for increasing and revealing his nature.

But Gaius Gracchus was a man of both excellent character and blazing
assiduousness, who had been educated from boyhood.  Don't even think that
there was anyone richer or more fruitful in speaking.  Indeed, the Roman
republic and Latin literature suffered a loss with his untimely death.  If
only he hadn't preferred to give loyalty to his brother rather than to his
native land!  With his character, had he only survived longer, he easily
would have achieved either his father's or his grandfather's renown.
Indeed, I know of no man who was his equal in eloquence.  He had a large
vocabulary, was sound in his opinions and impressive in his whole style.  He
hadn't put the finishing touches on his works; having nobly started many
things that he didn't completely finish.  But this orator, before anyone else,
must be read by our youth; for he can not only sharpen but also nourish
character.
