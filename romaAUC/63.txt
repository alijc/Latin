Marii apud populum contio

Marius, cupientissuma plebe consul factus, postquam ei provin ciam
Numidiam populus iussit, antea iam infestus nobilitati, tum vero
multus atque ferox instare.  Neque illi senatus, quamquam advorsus
erat, de ullo negotio abnuere audebat.  Tum Marius et plebem
hortandi causa et nobilitatem uti consueverat exagitandi contionem
populi advocavit.  Deinde hoc modo disseruit:

"Bellum me gerere cum Iugurtha iussistis, quam rem nobilitas
aegerrume tulit.  Comparate nunc, Quirites, cum illorum superbia me
hominem novom.  Quae illi audire et legere solent, eorum partem
vidi, alia egomet gessi; quae illi litteris, ea ego militando
didici.  Nunc vos existumate facta an dicta pluris sint.
Contemnunt novitatem meam, ego illorum ignaviam.

"Quod si iure me despiciunt, faciant idem maioribus suis, quibus
uti mihi ex virtute nobilitas coepit.  Invident honori meo; ergo
invideant labori, innocentiae, periculis etiam meis, quoniam per
haec illum cepi.  Sed quoniam vostra consilia accusantur, qui mihi
summum honorem et maxumum negotium imposuistis, etiam atque etiam
reputate num eorum paenitendum sit.  Non possum fidei causa
imagines neque triumphos aut consulatus maiorum meorum ostentare,
at hastas, vexillum, phaleras, alia militaria dona, praeterea
cicatrices advorso corpore.  Hae sunt meae imagines, haec
nobilitas, non hereditate relicta, ut illa illis, sed quae ego meis
plurumis laboribus et periculis quaesivi."

Huiuscemodi oratione habita, Marius, postquam plebis animos
adrectos videt, propere omnibus utilibus navis onerat.  Interea
milites scribere, non more maiorum ex classibus sed capite censos
plerosque.  Igitur cum aliquanto maiore numero quam decretum erat
in Africam profectus est.


Marius' speech before the people

After Marius was made consul by the impassioned commoners, the
people ordered him to the province of Numidia. Before this they'd
been hostile to the nobility, and indeed pursued them continuously
and ferociously. And the senate, which had been hostile,
didn't dare deny him anything.  Then Marius, for the sake
of exhorting both the commoners and nobility, as was his wont,
called a meeting to stir up the people. Then he set out in words in
this manner:

"You have ordered me to wage war against Iugurtha, a thing that the
nobility bore with great anxiety. Now, Romans, compare me, a new
man, with their arrogance. There are things that they are
accustomed to hear and read, to see as their role, but I have done
other things; what they learned from letters, I myself learned from
being a soldier. Now you must judge whether what is done is greater
than what is said. They despise my newness, and I their idleness.

"But if they justly despise me, let them do the same to their
ancestors, as nobility was created for me with their courage.
They envy me my office, therefore let them envy labor, integrity,
and even my own perils, since it was through these that I gained
it.  But because they find fault with your decisions, you who have
assigned me the highest office and greatest work, consider
carefully whether these decisions ought to offend them.  To gain
your trust I can show, not the images or triumphs or consulships of
my ancestors, but banners and other military decorations, in
addition to the scars of battle on my body.  These are my images,
this my nobility, not left to me as an inheritance, as they are for
those men, but which I have sought through my greatest labor and
perils."

After giving a speech of this sort, Marius saw that the spirits of
the common people were raised, and he quickly loaded the ships with
everything he needed.  Meanwhile the majority of the soldiers were
enlisted, not in classes, as was the custom of their ancestors, but
by head only.  Therefore he set out for Africa with a somewhat
larger number than had been decreed.
