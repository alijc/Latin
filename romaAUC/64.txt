Ciceronis de Mario sententia

Gaius Marius, cum a spe consulatus longe abesset et iam septimum
annum post praeturam iaceret, neque petiturus umquam consulatum
videretur, Quintum Metellum cuius legatus erat, summum virum et
civem, cum ab eo, imperatore suo, Romam missus esset, apud populum
Romanum criminatus est bellum illum ducere; si se consulem
fecissent, brevi tempore aut vivum aut mortuum Iugurtham se in
potestatem populi Romani redacturum.  Itaque factus est ille quidem
consul, sed a fide iustitiaque discessit, qui optimum et
gravissimum civem, cuius legatus et a quo missus esset, in invidiam
falso crimine adduxerit.

Cicero's opinions on Marius

After Gaius Marius' hope for a consulship had long since faded and
he'd been idling his life away for seven years after his
praetorship and it seemed that he'd never seek a consulship, he was
sent to Quintus Metellus, a great man and citizen, as an envoy.
And then, after he'd been sent to Rome by Metellus, his commander,
he charged Metellus, before the Roman people, with dragging that
war out.  He claimed that, were they only to make him consul, he'd
soon restore Jugurtha, dead or alive, into the power of the Roman
people.  And so he was indeed made consul, but abandoned good faith
and justice, he who would lead a very good and important citizen,
whose legate he was and by whom he'd been sent, into odium with a
false accusation.


Marii fortuna

Et post Teutonicos victor Libycosque triumphos
exul limosa Marius caput abdidit ulva.
Stagna avidi texere soli laxaeque paludes
depositum, Fortuna, tuum; mox vincula ferri
exedere senem longusque in carcere paedor.
Consul et eversa felix moriturus in urbe,
poenas ante dabat scelerum. Mors ipsa refugit
saepe virum. Servus nam primo caedis in actu
deriguit, ferrumque manu torpente remisit.
Viderat immensam tenebroso in carcere lucem
terribilesque deos scelerum Mariumque futurum,
audieratque pavens: "Fas haec contingere non est
colla tibi; debet multas hic legibus aevi
ante suam mortes.  Vanum depone furorem."
Deinde ferus vir per pelagum delatus iniquum
hostilem in terram, vacuisque mapalibus actus
nuda triumphati iacuit per regna Iugurthae
et Poenos pressit cineres. Solacia fati
Carthago Mariusque tulit.


The fate of Marius

And victorious after his Teutonic and Libyan triumphs,
the exile Marius hid his head in the reeds of a marsh.
Pools of sucking sand and spacious swamps covered
your deposit, Dame Fortune, and then chains of iron
and boundless filth consumed the old man in prison.
As he would die, a consul and happy, in the overthrown City,
he made atonement for his crime beforehand.  Death itself often
fled this man.  For, first, a slave froze at the act of murder,
and let fall the sword from his hand in fear.
He had seen a great light in the dark prison
and the terrible gods of wicked deeds, and Marius' future too,
and, quaking with fear, had heard: "It is not heaven's will for you to touch
his neck; this man owes many deaths to the law of time 
before his own. Put this empty rage aside."
Then the wild man was carried off across the unjust sea
to a hostile land, and driven to the empty huts
of the conquered, lay down in Jugurtha's laid-bare realms,
resting on Punic ashes. Carthage and Marius bore
the comforts of fate to each other.
