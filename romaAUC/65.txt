De Sullae natura cultuque

Ceterum dum ea res geritur, L. Sulla quaestor cum magno equitatu
in castra Romanorum venit.  Sed quoniam nos tanti viri res
admonuit, idoneum visum est de natura cultuque eius paucis dicere.
Neque enim alio loco de Sullae rebus dicturi sumus?  et
L. Sisenna, optume et diligentissume omnium qui eas res dixere
persecutus, parum mihi libero ore locutus videtur.

Igitur Sulla gentis patriciae nobilis fuit, familia prope iam
extincta maiorum ignavia; litteris Graecis et Latinis iuxta atque
doctissume eruditus; animo ingenti; cupidus voluptatum sed gloriae
cupidior; otio luxurioso esse; tamen ab negotiis numquam voluptas
remorata, nisi quod de uxore potuit honestius consuli; facundus,
callidus, et amicitia facilis; ad simulanda negotia altitudo
ingeni incredibilis; multarum rerum ac maxume pecuniae largitor.
Atque illi, felicissumo omnium ante civilem victoriam, numquam
super industriam fortuna fuit, multique dubitavere fortior an
felicior esset.  Nam postea quae fecerit, incertum habeo an pigeat
magis disserere.

---------------------

Igitur Sulla, uti supra dictum est, postquam in Africam atque in
castra Mari cum equitatu venit, rudis antea et ignarus belli, sollertis-
sumus omnium in paucis tempestatibus factus est.!7 Ad hoc milites
benigne appellare;!9 multis rogantibus, aliis per se ipse dare bene-
fivia;!9 invitus accipere, sed ea properantius quam aes mutuum
reddere;20 ipse ab nullo repetere, magis id laborare ut illi quam
plurumi deberent;?! ioca atque seria cum humillumis agere;2? in
operibus, in agmine, atque ad vigilias multus adesse;23 neque interim,
quod prava ambitio solet, consulis aut cuiusquam boni famam
laedere;24 tantum modo neque consilio neque manu priorem alium
pati,25 plerosque antevenire. Quibus rebus et artibus brevi Mario
militibusque carissumus factus est.26


Concerning Sulla's character and manner

Now, while this business was being carried on, the quaestor
L. Sulla came into the Romans' camp with a large body of cavalry.
And since the affair reminded us of so great a man, it seemed
suitable to speak a bit about his character and manner.  For I'm
not going to talk about Sulla's affairs anywhere else, and
L. Sisenna, who of all men has managed to most aptly and
diligently describe these things, seems to have done so with a
with too little freedom of speech.

So Sulla was of a well-born patrician clan, with a branch of
ancestors by then nearly reduced to obscurity by laziness; equally
well educated in both Greek and Latin literature; with a
remarkable intellect; eager for pleasure but passionate for glory;
he was a man of immoderate leisure; yet his enjoyment was never
delayed by his duties, except that he could have behaved more
reputably about his wife; eloquent, clever, and courteous in
friendship; with an incredible depth of ingenuity for feigning his
duties; a liberal giver of many things, and especially of money.
And for him, the luckiest of all men before his civil victory, his
luck was never above his industry, and many hesitated to decide
whether he was more powerful or luckier.  For what he would come
to do afterwards, I hold as uncertain whether or not it would
disgust one more to discuss.
