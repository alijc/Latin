Cicero Verrem accusans inimicitias optimatium suscipit

Quaeret aliquis fortasse: "Tantumne igitur laborem, tantas
inimicitias tot hominum suscepturus es?"  Non studio quidem hercule
ullo neque voluntate; sed non idem licet mihi quod iis qui nobili
genere nati sunt, quibus omnia populi Romani beneficia dormientibus
deferuntur; longe alia mihi lege in hac civitate et condicione
vivendum est.  Venit mihi in mentem M. Catonis, hominis
sapientissimi et vigilantissimi; qui cum se virtute, non genere,
populo Romano commendari putaret, cum ipse sui generis initium ac
nominis ab se gigni et propagari vellet, hominum potentissimorum
suscepit inimicitias, et maximis laboribus suis usque ad summam
senectutem summa cum gloria vixit.  Postea Q. Pompeius, humili atque
obscuro loco natus, nonne plurimis inimicitiis maximisque suis
periculis ac laboribus amplissimos honores est adeptus?  Modo
C. Fimbriam, C. Marium, C. Coelium vidimus non mediocribus
inimicitiis ac laboribus contendere, ut ad istos honores pervenirent
ad quos vos per ludum et per neglegentiam pervenistis.  Haec eadem
est nostrae rationis regio et via; horum nos hominum sectam atque
instituta persequimur.

In accusing Verres, Cicero incurs the enmity of the optimates 

Someone will perhaps ask: "So, are you really going to incur so much
toil and hostility from so many men?"  Indeed not rom eagerness, by
Hercules, nor from any desire; but I am not permitted the same things
as those born to the noble class, to whom all the offices of the
Roman people are granted while they sleep; there has long been a
different law and contract for me for residing in this city.  I am
minded of M. Cato, a very wise and vigilant man; since he believed
that he was commended by the Roman people for his courage, not his
birth, and since he himself wished that the origin of his family and
name would be passed on and propagated by him, he incurred the
hostility of the most powerful men, and through his great toils up
to his extreme old age lived with the greatest honor.  Afterwards,
didn't Q. Pompey, born to a low and obscure position, gain, through
so many hostilities, dangers and toils, the greatest honors?  But we
see that C. Fimbria, C. Marius, C. Coelius strive with above average
hostilities and toils, to arrive at those honors that you have
reached through idle sport.  This same course is the region and path
of my plan; I am following the path and principles of these men.


Videmus quanta sit in invidia quantoque in odio apud quosdam nobiles
homines novorum hominum virtus et industria; si tantulum oculos
deiecerimus, praesto esse insidias; si ullum locum aperuerimus
suspicioni aut crimini, accipiendum statim vulnus esse.  Semper
nobis vigilandum, semper laborandum videmus.  Inimicitiae sunt,
subeantur; labor, suscipiatur.  Etenim tacitae magis et occultae
inimicitiae timendae sunt quam indictae atque apertae.  Hominum
nobilium non fere quisquam nostrae industriae favet; nullis nostris
officiis benivolentiam illorum adlicere possumus; quasi natura et
genere diiuncti sint, ita dissident a nobis animo ac voluntate.
Quare quid habent eorum inimicitiae periculi, quorum animos iam ante
habueris inimicos et invidos quam ullas inimicitias susceperis?


We see how great is the spite and hatred that those noble men hold
for the character and industry of 'new' men; that, if we turn our
gaze aside for an instant, treachery is at hand; and if we expose
any place to suspicion or reproach, an injury is immediately
assumed.  We must be seen as always on our guard, always toiling.
The hostilities exist, they must be endured; the toil, it must be
undertaken.  And indeed, the silent secret enmities should be feared
more than those proclaimed and open.  Among the noble men hardly
anyone is in favor of our industry; by none of our services can we
win over the benevolence of those men; as if nature and birth could
be separated, so that they are different from us in heart and
spirit.  Therefore what danger do these enmities hold for them,
whose hearts you could have already held as more hostile and
malevolent than any other enmities you might receive?
