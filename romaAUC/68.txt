A. Iurgia Luculli atque Pompeii

Cum esset in fine bellum piraticum et L. Lucullus, qui ante septem
annos ex consulatu sortitus Asiam Mithridati oppositus erat magnasque
et memorabiles res ibi gesserat, idem bellum adhuc administraret,
Manilius, tribunus plebis, legem tulit ut bellum Mithridaticum per
Cn. Pompeium administraretur.  Accepta ea, magnis certatum est inter
imperatores iurgiis, cum Pompeius Lucullo infamiam pecuniae, Lucullus
Pompeio interminatam cupiditatem obiceret imperii.  Nam neque
Pompeius, ut primum ad rem publicam adgressus est, quem quam omnino
parem tulit, et in quibus rebus primus esse debebat, solus esse
cupiebat.  Neque eo viro quisquam aut alia omnia minus aut gloriam
magis concupiit; in appetendis honoribus immodicus, in gerendis
verecundissimus.  Et Lucullus, summus alioqui vir, profusae huius in
aedificiis convictibusque et apparatibus luxuriae primus auctor fuit,
quem, ob iniectas moles mari et receptum suffossis montibus in terras
mare, haud infacete Magnus Pompeius Xerxen togatum vocare adsueverat.


The quarrels of Lucullus and Pompey

When the pirate war was over, L. Lucullus, who, seven years earlier,
after his consulship, had been assigned Asia, opposing Mithridates,
and had done great and remarkable things there, was still managing
that war.  Then Manilius, the tribune of the plebs, proposed a law
that the Mithridatian War be managed by Cn. Pompey.  When this act
passed, it was disputed with great quarrels between the generals, as
Pompey upbraided Lucullus with the disgrace of coveting money, and
Lucullus Pompey with an inordinate greed for command.  For Pompey,
ever since he'd  entered into public life, didn't consider anyone
to be his equal, and thinking that he ought to be first in these matters,
had no wish to share the command.  Nor did anyone covet glory more
or all else less than this man; excessive in seeking offices, but so
modest in managing them.  And Lucullus, the greatest man otherwise,
was the principal authority of this extravagant luxury in buildings
and banquets and splendor, whom, on account of his plugging the sea
with rocks gotten by digging the sea into mountains, Pompey Magnus
was used to, rather wittily, calling him the toga-wearing Xerxes.


B. Luculli res gestae

Atque, ut omnes intellegant me Lucio Lucullo tantum impertire laudis,
quantum forti viro et sapienti homini et magno imperatori debeatur, dico
eius adventu maximas Mithridati copias omnibus rebus ornatas
atque instructas fuisse,
urbemque Asiae clarissimam nobisque amicissimam Cyzicenorum obsessam esse ab
ipso rege maxima multitudine et oppugnatam vehementissime;
quam L. Lucullus virtute, adsiduitate, consilio summis obsidionis periculisliberavit.
Ab eodem imperatore classem magnam et ornatam,
quae ducibus Sertorianis ad Italiam studio atque odio inflammata raperetur,
superatam esse atque depressam;
magnas hostium praeterea copias multis proeliis esse deletas patefactumque
nostris legionibus esse Pontum,
qui antea populo Romano ex omni aditu clausus fuisset;
Sinopen atque Amisum, quibus in oppidis erant domicilia regis,
omnibus rebus ornatas ac refertas,
ceterasque urbes Ponti et Cappadociae permultas uno aditu adventuque esse captas;
regem spoliatum regno patrio atque avito ad alios se reges atque ad alias gentes
supplicem contulisse; 
atque haec omnia salvis populi Romani sociis atque integris vectigalibus esse gesta.


B. Actions carried out by Lucullus

Also,
so that everyone might realize that I bestow as much praise on Lucius Lucullus,
as is owed a strong man and a wise person and a great general, I say that
at his arrival the most powerful forces had been equipped and prepared in
all ways for Mithridates,
and that the most famous and city of Asia, and the one most loyal to us,
that of the Cyzicenes, was under siege from a vast multitude
under the command of the king himself
and was violently attacked;
and that L. Lucullus, with courage, attention, and strategy,
liberated it from the utmost peril of the siege.
And that a great and well equipped fleet from the same general,
commanded by Sertorian officers, that was rushed towards Italy,
inflamed with zeal and hatred, had been vanquished and sunk;
in addition, large enemy forces were destroyed in many battles and Pontus, 
which had hitherto had been closed on every side to the people of Rome,
was laid open to our legions;
Sinope and Amisum, in which towns the king's palaces were,
in all things well equipped and supplied,
and very many other cities of Pontus and Cappadocia were taken
by a mere approach and arrival;
the king, robbed of his father's and ancestors' kingdom,
betook himself to other kings and to other nations as supplicant;
and all these things were done without damage to the allies of the Roman people
or to its tax base.
