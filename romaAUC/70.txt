A. Mors neque miseranda neque deflenda est

"Iam iam non domus accipiet te laeta, neque uxor
optima nec dulces occurrent oscula nati
praeripere et tacita pectus dulcedine tangent.
Non poteris factis florentibus esse, tuisque
praesidium.  Misero misere", aiunt, "omnia ademit
una dies infesta tibi tot praemia vitae." 
Illud in his rebus non addunt: "Nec tibi earum
iam desiderium rerum super insidet una."
Quod bene si videant animo dictisque sequantur, 
dissoluant animi magno se angore metuque.
"Tu quidem ut es leto sopitus, sic eris aevi
quod superest, cunctis privatus doloribus aegris.
At nos horrifico cinefactum te prope busto
insatiabiliter deflevimus, aeternumque
nulla dies nobis maerorem e pectore demet."
Illud ab hoc igitur quaerendum est, quid sit amari
tantopere, ad somnum si res redit atque quietem,
cur quisquam aeterno possit tabescere luctu.


The dead should neither be pitied nor mourned

"No longer will a happy house or your good wife receive you,
nor will your sweet children run to meet you to snatch kisses,
or touch your heart with a tenderness too deep for words.
You won't be able to be prosperous in your affairs,
or protection for your loved ones.  They say, "A single violent day
wretchedly stole all the many joys of life from you, you wretch."
In this they do not add: "But on the other hand,
the desire for these will not remain for you."
If they saw this well in their minds and followed it in their words,
their minds would free themselves of great distress and dread.
"Indeed, as you sleep in death, so you will
be freed from every painful sorrow, for all time.
But we, beside the dreadful pyre, insatiably lament you,
reduced to ash, and no day will ever take the grief from our hearts."
Therefore he should seek out why it is so bitter,
if the matter returns to sleep and quiet,
that anyone would waste away in lasting grief.
