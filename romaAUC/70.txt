A. Mors neque miseranda neque deflenda est

"Iam iam non domus accipiet te laeta, neque uxor
optima nec dulces occurrent oscula nati
praeripere et tacita pectus dulcedine tangent.
Non poteris factis florentibus esse, tuisque
praesidium.  Misero misere", aiunt, "omnia ademit
una dies infesta tibi tot praemia vitae." 
Illud in his rebus non addunt: "Nec tibi earum
iam desiderium rerum super insidet una."
Quod bene si videant animo dictisque sequantur, 
dissoluant animi magno se angore metuque.
"Tu quidem ut es leto sopitus, sic eris aevi
quod superest, cunctis privatus doloribus aegris.
At nos horrifico cinefactum te prope busto
insatiabiliter deflevimus, aeternumque
nulla dies nobis maerorem e pectore demet."
Illud ab hoc igitur quaerendum est, quid sit amari
tantopere, ad somnum si res redit atque quietem,
cur quisquam aeterno possit tabescere luctu.


Death should neither be pitied nor mourned

"No longer will a happy house receive you, nor will 
your good wife nor children run to meet you to snatch pleasant kisses,
and a heart too deep for words will strike with sweetness.
You won't be able to be prosperous in your affairs,
or protection for your loved ones.  They say, "A single dangerous day
wretchedly stole all the many joys of life from your wretched self."
What follows in these matters does not add: "Besides,
nor will the desire for material things remain to you as well."
If they saw this well in their minds and followed it in their words,
their minds would dissolve in great distress and dread.
"Indeed, as you are made asleep by death, so you will for all time,
freed from every painful sorrow.
But we, beside the dreadful pyre, insatiatably lament you,
reduced to ash, and no day will ever
take the grief from our hearts."
Therefore what follows should be sought by him, what is so bitter,
if the matter returns to sleep and quiet,
that anyone would forever dissolve in grief.
