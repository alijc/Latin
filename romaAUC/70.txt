A. Mors neque miseranda neque deflenda est

"Iam iam non domus accipiet te laeta, neque uxor
optima nec dulces occurrent oscula nati
praeripere et tacita pectus dulcedine tangent.
Non poteris factis florentibus esse, tuisque
praesidium.  Misero misere", aiunt, "omnia ademit
una dies infesta tibi tot praemia vitae." 
Illud in his rebus non addunt: "Nec tibi earum
iam desiderium rerum super insidet una."
Quod bene si videant animo dictisque sequantur, 
dissoluant animi magno se angore metuque.
"Tu quidem ut es leto sopitus, sic eris aevi
quod superest, cunctis privatus doloribus aegris.
At nos horrifico cinefactum te prope busto
insatiabiliter deflevimus, aeternumque
nulla dies nobis maerorem e pectore demet."
Illud ab hoc igitur quaerendum est, quid sit amari
tantopere, ad somnum si res redit atque quietem,
cur quisquam aeterno possit tabescere luctu.


The dead should neither be pitied nor mourned

"No longer will a happy house or your good wife receive you,
nor will your sweet children run to meet you to snatch kisses,
or touch your heart with a tenderness too deep for words.
You won't be able to be prosperous in your affairs,
or protection for your loved ones.  They say, "A single violent day
wretchedly stole all the many joys of life from you, you wretch."
In this they do not add: "But on the other hand,
the desire for these will not remain for you."
If they saw this well in their minds and followed it in their words,
their minds would free themselves of great distress and dread.
"Indeed, as you sleep in death, so you will
be freed from every painful sorrow, for all time.
But we, beside the dreadful pyre, insatiably lament you,
reduced to ash, and no day will ever take the grief from our hearts."
Therefore he should seek out why it is so bitter,
if the matter returns to sleep and quiet,
that anyone would waste away in lasting grief.

 
B. Mors omnibus aeque stabilita timenda non est

Hoc etiam tibi tute interdum dicere possis:
"Lumina suis oculis etiam bonus Anc√ºs reliquit
qui melior multis quam tu fuit, improbe, rebus.
Inde alii multi reges rerumque potentes
occiderunt, magnis qui gentibus imperitarunt.
Ille quoque ipse, viam qui quondam per mare magnum
stravit iterque dedit legionibus ire per altum
ac pedibus salsas docuit super ire lacunas 
et contempsit equis insultans murmura ponti,
lumine adempto animam moribundo corpore fudit.
Scipiadas, belli fulmen, Carthaginis horror,
ossa dedit terrae proinde ac famul infimus esset.
Ipse Epicurus obit decurso lumine vitae,
qui genus humanum ingenio superavit et omnis 
restinxit, stellas exortus ut aetherius sol.
Tu vero dubitabis et indignabere obire?
Mortua cui vita est prope iam vivo atque videnti,
qui somno partem maiorem conteris aevi
et vigilans stertis nec somnia cernere cessas
sollicitamque geris cassa formidine mentem."


Death, as it applies to all men equally, is not to be feared

You should be able say this to yourself now and then:
"Good Ancus likewise relinguished the light from his eyes,
he who was better than you, you cad, in many ways.
Since then many other kings and rulers,
who governed great nations, have persished.
Likewise this man himself, who once stretched a highway across the sea
and gave his legions a passage to cross the deep
and taught them to walk over salty pools on foot
and mocked, with bounding horses, the crashings of the sea,
with the light withdrawn, he shed his soul from his dying body.
Scipio's son, the thunderbolt of war, the dread of Carthage,
gave his bones to the earth, the same as the humblest slave would do.
Even Epicurus died, with the light of his life rushing down,
he who by his nature surpassed mankind and extinguished
all the rest, as the sun rising in the sky does to the stars.
In truth, will you dilly-dally and object to going?
You whose life is nearly spent, but still alive and looking round,
who'd spend most of your life asleep,
snores even while awake and keeps dreaming,
and bears a mind troubled with an empty fear.
