Cicero in Catilinam invehit

Quo usque tandem abutere, Catilina, patientia nostra?  Quam diu etiam
furor iste tuus nos eludet?  Quem ad finem sese effrenata iactabit
audacia?  Nihilne te nocturnum praesidium Palati, nihil urbis vigiliae,
nihil timor populi, nihil concursus bonorum omnium, nihil hic munitissimus
habendi senatus locus, nihil horum ora voltusque moverunt?  Patere tua
consilia non sentis?  Constrictam iam horum omnium scientia teneri
coniurationem tuam non vides?  Quid proxima, quid superiore nocte egeris,
ubi fueris, quos convocaveris, quid consili ceperis, quem nostrum ignorare
arbitraris?

O tempora! O mores! Senatus haec intellegit, consul videt; hic tamen
vivit. Vivit?  Immo vero etiam in senatum venit, fit publici consili
particeps, notat et designat oculis ad caedem unum quemque nostrum.  Nos
autem, fortes viri, satis facere rei publicae videmur, si istius furorem
ac tela vitemus.  Ad mortem te, Catilina, duci iussu consulis iam pridem
oportebat; in te conferri pestem quam tu in nos omnes iam diu machinaris.

Cicero inveighs against Catilina

How long will you abuse our patience, Catilina?  For what length of time
will this madness of yours yet mock us?  When will your unbridled
effrontery finally sputter out?  Haven't the Palatine night guard, the
city watch, the fear of the people, the assembly of all honest men, this
well-defended place for holding the senate, or the expressions and faces
of these men shaken you?  Don't you realize that your plans are well
known?  Don't you see that your conspiracy is already in chains,
restrained by the knowledge of all these men?  Do you imagine that any one
of us does not know what you did last night, or the one before that, where
you were, who you met with, what plan you seized upon?

Oh the times! Oh the morals!  The senate understands this, the consul sees
it; and yet this man still lives.  Lives?  Not only that, but he even
comes into the senate and takes part in public debate, and observes and
marks each one of us for murder with his eyes.  But we, powerful men, seem
to do enough for the republic if we evade that man's madness, and his
darts.  You should have been led to your death by consular command a long
time ago; to have had the destruction directed against you that you have
long been plotting against all of us.

An vero vir amplissimus Publius Scipio, pontifex maximus, Tiberium
Gracchum mediocriter labefactantem statum rei publicae privatus
interfecit â€” Catilinam, orbem terrae caede atque incendiis vastare
cupientem, nos consules perferemus?  Habemus senatus consultum in
te, Catilina, vehemens et grave.  Non deest rei publicae consilium
neque auctoritas huius ordinis; nos, nos, dico aperte, consules
desumus.

Sed polliceor hoc vobis, patres conscripti, tantam in nobis fore
diligentiam, tantam in vobis auctoritatem, tantam in equitibus
Romanis virtutem, tantam in omnibus bonis consensionem, ut
Catilinae profectione omnia patefacta, illustrata, oppressa,
vindicata esse videatis.  Hisce ominibus Catilina, cum summa rei
publicae salute, cum tua peste ac pernicie, cumque eorum exitio
qui se tecum omni scelere parricidioque iunxerunt, proficiscere ad
impium bellum ac nefarium.

Tu, Iuppiter, qui isdem quibus haec urbs auspiciis a Romulo es
constitutus, quem Statorem huius urbis atque imperi vere
nominamus, hunc et huius socios a tuis ceterisque templis, a
tectis urbis ac moenibus, a vita fortunisque civium omnium
arcebis; et homines bonorum inimicos, hostes patriae, latrones
Italiae, scelerum foedere inter se ac nefaria societate
coniunctos, aeternis suppliciis vivos mortuosque mactabis.


Didn't the great man Publius Scipio, the Pontifex Maximus, as a
private citizen kill Tiberius Gracchus, shaking the state of the
republic just a bit?  But we consuls will suffer covetous Catilina
to lay waste to the world with slaughter and fire.  We in the
senate have passed a resolution against you, Catilina, severe and
grave.  The republic doesn't lack foresight, nor does this
assembly lack authority; it is us, I say publicly, us consuls who
are wanting.

But I promise you this, father senators, that there will be such
diligence in us, such authority in you, such courage in the Roman
knights, such harmony in all honest men, that you'll see that by
Catilina's departure all has been revealed, illuminated,
suppressed, and punished.  With all this Catilina, for the utmost
safety of the republic, and for your destruction and ruin and for
the deaths of those who have joined with you in every crime and
treason.  leave us for your wicked and ungodly war.

You, Jupiter, whose temple was founded by Romulus under the same
auspices as this city, whom we truthfully call the Establisher of
this city and of command, you will shut this man and his
associates out of your temples and all the others, from the roofs
and walls of the city, and from the lives and prosperity of all of
its citizens; And you will overthrow these men, the foes of the
good, enemies of the fatherland, brigands of Italy, by an alliance
of crimes, living and the dead, between yourself and a nefarious
society yoked together in eternal suffering.
