Catilinae ingenium

Studuit Catilinae Caelius - sed et multi hoc idem ex omni ordine
atque ex omni aetate fecerunt.  Habuit enim ille permulta maximarum
non expressa signa sed adumbrata lineamenta virtutum.  Utebatur
hominibus improbis multis; et quidem optimis se viris deditum esse
simulabat.  Erant apud illum inlecebrae libidinum multae; erant
etiam industriae quidam stimuli ac laboris.  Flagrabant vitia
libidinis apud illum; vigebant etiam studia rei militaris.  Neque
ego umquam fuisse tale monstrum in terris ullum puto, tam ex
contrariis diversisque et inter se pugnantibus naturae studiis
cupiditatibusque conflatum.  Quis clarioribus viris quodam tempore
iucundior, quis turpioribus coniunctior?  quis civis meliorum
partium aliquando, quis taetrior hostis huic civitati?  quis in
voluptatibus inquinatior, quis in laboribus patientior?  quis in
rapacitate avarior? quis in largitione effusior?

Catilina's character

Caelius was a supporter of Catilina - but many men from every class
and generation did the same.  For that man had a great many of the
greatest virtues that were not clearly defined images, but only
sketched out lines.  He used to associate with many wicked men; and
indeed, he would pretend to have given himself to the best men.
There were many allurements of pleasures in him; there were also
pricklings of industry and labor.  The vices of lust blazed in him;
the study of military matters throve as well.  And I think that
there has never been any such portent in the land, so forged out of
opposite and diverse devotions and lusts of character at odds with
one another.  Who was more agreeable at any time to the more
illustrious men, and who was tied more tightly to the more shameful
ones?  Who was ever a citizen of better parts, who a fouler enemy
to this state?  Who was more defiled with pleasures, who more
long-suffering in toils?  Who was greedier in his rapacity?  Who
more extravagant in largess?


Illa vero, iudices, in illo homine admirabilia fuerunt:
comprehendere multos amicitia,
tueri obsequio, cum omnibus communicare quod habebat;
servire temporibus suorum omnium pecunia,
gratia, labore corporis, scelere etiam si opus esset, et audacia;
versare suam naturam et regere ad tempus atque huc et illuc torquere ac flectere;
cum tristibus severe, cum remissis iucunde, cum senibus graviter,
cum juventute comiter, cum facinerosis audacter,
cum libidinosis luxuriose vivere.

Hac ille tam varia multiplicique natura cum omnes omnibus
ex terris homines improbos audacesque collegerat,
tum etiam multos fortes viros et bonos specie quadam virtutis adsimulatae tenebat.
Neque umquam ex illo delendi huius imperi tam consceleratus
impetus exstitisset nisi tot vitiorum tanta immanitas quibusdam facultatis
et patientiae radicibus niteretur.16
Me ipsum, me inquam, quondam
paene ille decepit, cum et civis mihi bonus et optimi cuiusque
cupidus et firmus amicus ac fidelis videretur.17 Cuius ego facinora
oculis prius quam opinione, manibus ante quam suspicione deprehendi. 18
Cuius in magnis catervis amicorum si fuit Caelius, magis est
ut ipse moleste ferat errasse se ยน9 (sicuti non numquam in eodem
homine me quoque erroris mei paenitet) 20 quam ut istius amicitiae
crimen reformidet.21


Truly, my judges, these things were paradoxical in that man:
to embrace many in friendship,
to uphold in obsequiousness, to share what he had with everyone;
to serve in all of his followers' times of need with money, with favors,
with bodily toil, even with crime if work would be, and with daring;
to spin and direct his own nature according to the time,
and to twist and bend this way and that; 
to live sternly with the sorrowful, congenially with the easy-going,
gravely with the aged, courteously with the young,
boldly with the wicked, and wantonly with the lustful.

With this varying complex nature he had so much not only 
assembled every shameless and audacious man from every land,
but also held many powerful and noble men by a certain
appearance of similar virtue.
