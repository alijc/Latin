Catilinae ingenium

Studuit Catilinae Caelius - sed et multi hoc idem ex omni ordine
atque ex omni aetate fecerunt.  Habuit enim ille permulta maximarum
non expressa signa sed adumbrata lineamenta virtutum.  Utebatur
hominibus improbis multis; et quidem optimis se viris deditum esse
simulabat.  Erant apud illum inlecebrae libidinum multae; erant
etiam industriae quidam stimuli ac laboris.  Flagrabant vitia
libidinis apud illum; vigebant etiam studia rei militaris.  Neque
ego umquam fuisse tale monstrum in terris ullum puto, tam ex
contrariis diversisque et inter se pugnantibus naturae studiis
cupiditatibusque conflatum.  Quis clarioribus viris quodam tempore
iucundior, quis turpioribus coniunctior?  quis civis meliorum
partium aliquando, quis taetrior hostis huic civitati?  quis in
voluptatibus inquinatior, quis in laboribus patientior?  quis in
rapacitate avarior? quis in largitione effusior?

Illa vero, iudices, in illo homine admirabilia fuerunt:
comprehendere multos amicitia, tueri obsequio, cum omnibus
communicare quod habebat; servire temporibus suorum omnium pecunia,
gratia, labore corporis, scelere etiam si opus esset, et audacia;
versare suam naturam et regere ad tempus atque huc et illuc
torquere ac flectere; cum tristibus severe, cum remissis iucunde,
cum senibus graviter, cum juventute comiter, cum facinerosis
audacter, cum libidinosis luxuriose vivere.

Hac ille tam varia multiplicique natura cum omnes omnibus ex terris
homines improbos audacesque collegerat, tum etiam multos fortes
viros et bonos specie quadam virtutis adsimulatae tenebat.  Neque
umquam ex illo delendi huius imperi tam consceleratus impetus
exstitisset nisi tot vitiorum tanta immanitas quibusdam facultatis
et patientiae radicibus niteretur.  Me ipsum, me inquam, quondam
paene ille decepit, cum et civis mihi bonus et optimi cuiusque
cupidus et firmus amicus ac fidelis videretur.  Cuius ego facinora
oculis prius quam opinione, manibus ante quam suspicione
deprehendi.  Cuius in magnis catervis amicorum si fuit Caelius,
magis est ut ipse moleste ferat errasse se (sicuti non numquam in
eodem homine me quoque erroris mei paenitet) quam ut istius
amicitiae crimen reformidet.


Catilina's character

Caelius was a supporter of Catilina - but many men from every class
and generation did the same.  For that man had a great many of the
greatest virtues that were not clearly defined images, but only
sketched out lines.  He used to associate with many wicked men; and
indeed, he would pretend to have given himself to the best men.
There were many allurements of pleasures in him; there were also
pricklings of industry and labor.  The vices of lust blazed in him;
the study of military matters throve as well.  And I think that
there has never been any such portent in the land, so forged out of
opposite and diverse devotions and lusts of character at odds with
one another.  Who was more agreeable at any time to the more
illustrious men, and who was tied more tightly to the more shameful
ones?  Who was ever a citizen of better parts, who a fouler enemy
to this state?  Who was more defiled with pleasures, who more
long-suffering in toils?  Who was greedier in his rapacity?  Who
more extravagant in largess?

Truly, my judges, these things were paradoxical in that man: to
embrace many in friendship, to hold their alliance, to share what
he had with everyone; to serve in all of his followers' times of
need with money, with favors, with bodily toil, even with crime if
need be, and with daring; to spin and direct his own nature
according to the time, and to twist and bend this way and that; to
live strictly with the sorrowful, congenially with the easy-going,
gravely with the aged, courteously with the young, boldly with the
wicked, and wantonly with the lustful.

With such a variable and complex nature he had not only assembled
every shameless and audacious man from every land, but also held
many powerful and noble men by the outward appearance of a
counterfeit virtue.  And the attack for annihilating this state, so
stained with crime, would never have emerged from that man had not
such a great brutality of so many vices been based on some elements
of means and patience.  I tell you, he once nearly deceived even
me, when to me he seemed both an honest citizen and eager for the
acquaintance of each best citizen, and a loyal and faithful friend.
And I uncovered his outrages through my eyes before my
understanding, and by the evidence in my hands before my
suspicions.  And if Caelius was among his great crowds of friends,
it is better for him to bear it hard that he had erred (just as it
often causes me to repent my own error as regards this same man)
than to be shunned for the sin of friendship with that man.
