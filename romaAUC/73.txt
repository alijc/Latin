Catulli carmina varia

A.
Multas per gentes et multa per aequora vectus
 advenio has miseras, frater, ad inferias,
ut te postremo donarem munere mortis 
 et mutam nequiquam adloquerer cinerem.
Quandoquidem fortuna mihi tete abstulit ipsum,
 heu miser indigne frater adempte mihi,
nunc tamen interea haec, prisco quae more parentum
 tradita sunt tristi munere ad inferias,
accipe fraterno multum manantia fletu;
 atque in perpetuum, frater, ave atque vale.

Borne through many nations and over many seas,
 I have come for these doleful funeral rites,
to present you with the final gifts for the dead
 and to address your silent ashes in vain.
Since fate has stolen you yourself away from me,
 alas poor brother, unjustly taken from me,
But now accept these gifts, that by our forefathers' ancient custom,
 were given as a mourning gift at this sorrowful rite,
with a brother's tears freely flowing;
 and forever, brother, greetings and farewell.


B.
Iam ver egelidos refert tepores;
iam caeli furor aequinoctialis
iucundis Zephyri silescit auris.
Linquantur Phrygii, Catulle, campi
Nicaeaeque ager uber aestuosae;
ad claras Asiae volemus urbes.
Iam mens praetrepidans avet vagar
iam laeti studio pedes vigescunt.
O dulces comitum valete coetu
longe quos simul a domo profectos
diversae varie viae reportant.

Now spring restores a gentle warmth;
now the raging of the equinoctial sky
is calmed by Zephyr's pleasant breezes.
Let the Phrygian plains be forsaken, Catullus,
and sweltering Nicacaea's fertile field;
to the gleaming cities of Asia let us fly.
Now my restive mind yearns to roam,
now my happy feet grow strong with zeal.
O sweet band of comrades, farewell!
who likewise, far away from home,
the different roads bear back separately.


C.
Paene insularum, Sirmio, insularumque
ocelle, quascumque in liquentibus stagnis
marique vasto fert uterque Neptunus,
quam te libenter quamque laetus inviso,
vix mi ipse credens Thyniam atque Bithynos
liquisse campos et videre te in tuto.
o quid solutis est beatius curis,
cum mens onus reponit, ac peregrino
labore fessi venimus larem ad nostrum,
desideratoque acquiescimus lecto?
hoc est quod unum est pro laboribus tantis.
salve, o venusta Sirmio, atque ero gaude;
gaudente, vosque, o Lydiae lacus undae,
ridete quidquid est domi cachinnorum.

O Sirmio, of near-islands and of islands
the gem, which, whether in clear lagoons
or in the vast sea, Neptune bears,
How joyfully and how gladly I gaze on you,
scarcely believing that I've left the Thynian and Bithynian
fields behind and see you safe and secure.
O, what is more blessed than to be freed from cares,
when the mind lays down its burden, and we,
wearied with toil from foreign parts, come to our hearth,
and repose on our longed-for bed?
This is that one thing that befits such labors.
Hail, O lovely Sirmio, and rejoice for your rejoicing
master, and you, O Lydian waves of the lake,
laugh whatever laughter there is at home.


D.
Si quicquam mutis gratum acceptumve sepulcris
accidere a nostro, Calve, dolore potest,
quo desiderio veteres renovamus amores
atque olim missas flemus amicitias,
certe non tanto mors immatura dolori est
Quintiliae, quantum gaudet amore tuo.32

If anything pleasing or welcome to the silent tomb
can fall from our sorrow, Calvus, 
with this longing we revive our former loves
and ever weep for lost friends,
surely an untimely death is less a grief to Quintilia
than were her joys in your love.


E.
Disertissime Romuli nepotum, 
quot sunt quotque fuere, Marce Tulli, 
quotque post aliis erunt in annis,
gratias tibi maximas Catullus
agit pessimus omnium poeta; 
tanto pessimus omnium poeta,
quanto tu optimus omnium patronus.37

Oh, most eloquent of Romulus' descendants,
despite how many there are and were, Marcus Tullius,
and how many there will be later in coming years,
Catullus, the worst poet of all,
gives you the greatest thanks;
he is as much the worst poet of all,
as you are the best advocate of all.


F.
Nil nimium studeo, Caesar, tibi velle placere,
 nec scire utrum sis albus an ater homo.

Not at all do I desire, Caesar, to wish to please you,
 nor to know whether you are a fair man or a dark one.
