Catulli carmina varia

A.
Multas per gentes et multa per aequora vectus
 advenio has miseras, frater, ad inferias,
ut te postremo donarem munere mortis 
 et mutam nequiquam adloquerer cinerem.
Quandoquidem fortuna mihi tete abstulit ipsum,
 heu miser indigne frater adempte mihi,
nunc tamen interea haec, prisco quae more parentum
 tradita sunt tristi munere ad inferias,
accipe fraterno multum manantia fletu;
 atque in perpetuum, frater, ave atque vale.

Borne through many nations and over many seas,
 I have come for these doleful funeral rites,
to present you with the final gifts for the dead
 and to address your silent ashes in vain.
Since fate has stolen you yourself away from me,
 alas poor brother, unjustly taken from me,
But now accept these gifts, that by our forefathers' ancient custom,
 were given as a mourning gift at this sorrowful rite,
with a brother's tears freely flowing;
 and forever, brother, greetings and farewell.
