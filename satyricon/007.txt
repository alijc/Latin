[VII] "Rogo, inquam, mater, numquid scis ubi ego habitem?" Delectata est illa
urbanitate tam stulta et: "Quidni sciam?" inquit, consurrexitque et coepit me
praecedere. Divinam ego putabam et subinde ut in locum secretiorem venimus,
centonem anus urbana reiecit et: "Hic, inquit, debes habitare." Cum ego negarem
me agnoscere domum, video quosdam inter titulos nudasque meretrices furtim
spatiantes. Tarde, immo iam sero intellexi me in fornicem esse
deductum. Execratus itaque aniculae insidias operui caput et per medium lupanar
fugere coepi in alteram partem, cum ecce in ipso aditu occurrit mihi aeque
lassus ac moriens Ascyltos: putares ab eadem anicula esse deductum. Itaque ut
ridens eum consalutavi, quid in loco tam deformi faceret quaesivi.


"I pray you", I say, "mother, do you happen to know where I live?"
She was delighted at such stupid urbanity and replied: "Why wouldn't I know?",
and stood up and began to lead me.  I thought her divinely inspired and
straightway, as we got to a private spot, the urbane hag threw back a
patchwork quilt and said: "Here is where you ought to be living." 
When I denied that I recognized the house, I see some men stealthily
strolling among placards and naked prostitutes.


Slowly, indeed too late, I realized that I had been led into a brothel.
And so, cursing the old woman's treachery, I covered my head and 
began to flee through the middle of the brothel to a different part,
when lo Ascyltos, equally weary and fainting, comes running to meet me
at the very entrance.  You would have thought that he had been led
that by the same old woman.  And so, just as I hailed him, laughing,
I asked him what he was doing in such a unseemly place.
