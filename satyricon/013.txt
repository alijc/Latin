[XIII]

O lusum fortunae mirabilem! Nam adhuc ne suturae quidem attulerat
rusticus curiosas manus, sed tanquam mendici spolium etiam fastidiose
venditabat. Ascyltos postquam depositum esse inviolatum vidit et personam
vendentis contemptam, seduxit me paululum a turba et: "Scis, inquit,
frater, rediisse ad nos thesaurum de quo querebar? Illa est tunicula
adhuc, ut apparet, intactis aureis plena. Quid ergo facimus, aut quo iure
rem nostram vindicamus?"  Exhilaratus ego non tantum quia praedam
videbam, sed etiam quod fortuna me a turpissima suspicione dimiserat,
negavi circuitu agendum sed plane iure civili dimicandum, ut si nollet
alienam rem domino reddere, ad interdictum veniret.


O wonderful sport of fortune!  For indeed, thus far the country fellow 
hadn't brought curious hands to the seam, but was disdainfully offering
it for sale as if it were the leavings of a beggar. Ascyltos, after he had 
pulled it down, saw that it was untouched and that the seller was a 
contemptible character, drew me a little away from the crowd and said:
"You know, brother, the treasure about which I was complaining has
returned to us. That is the tunic that thus far, so it would appear,
is filled with our untouched gold.  So, what do we do?  Or by what right
do we claim our property?  

I was gladdened, and not only because I saw the prize, but also because
fortune had freed me from a really ugly suspicion, 
I said that the thing shouldn't be done by going round in circles,
but plainly it should be contended in civil law,
so that if he didn't want to return the property to its rightful owner,
he would come to an interdiction.
