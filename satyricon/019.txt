[XIX] 

Omnia mimico risu exsonuerant, cum interim nos quae tam repentina esset
mutatio animorum facta ignoraremus, ac modo nosmetipsos, modo mulieres
intueremur.

"Ideo vetui hodie in hoc deversorio quemquam mortalium admitti, ut
remedium tertianae sine ulla interpellatione a vobis acciperem." Vt
haec dixit Quartilla, Ascyltos quidem paulisper obstupuit, ego autem
frigidior hieme Gallica factus nullum potui verbum emittere. Sed ne
quid tristius expectarem, comitatus faciebat. Tres enim erant
mulierculae, si quid vellent conari, infirmissimae, scilicet contra
nos, <quibus> si nihil aliud, virilis sexus esset. At praecincti certe
altius eramus. Immo ego sic iam paria composueram ut, si depugnandum
foret, ipse cum Quartilla consisterem, Ascyltos cum ancilla, Giton cum
virgine.

Tunc vero excidit omnis constantia attonitis, et mors non dubia
miserorum oculos coepit obducere.

Everything resounded with a mime's laughter, but in the meantime we
didn't know what was such a sudden change of heart, and stared at
now each other, and now the women.

"Therefore I have forbidden that any mortal be admitted to this inn
today, so that I might recieve from you the remedy for tertianary fever
without any interruption."  Ad Quartilla said these words, even
Ascyltos was struck dumb for an instant, but I became colder than a
Gallic winter and could get out not a word.  But my company made it so
that I might not expect anything worse.  For they were three women, and
if they tried anything, were frail, of course against us, who were, if
nothing else, at least male.  But we were certainly better girded for a
fight.  No indeed, I had already arranged the matchs so, if it must
come to blows, that I myself stood against Quartilla, Ascyltos against
the maid, and Giton the girl.

Then truly courage perished with all astonished, and death without
doubt began to cover over the eyes of us wretches.
