[XX]

"Rogo, inquam, domina, si quid tristius paras, celerius confice: neque
enim tam magnum facinus admisimus, ut debeamus torti perire." ...

Ancilla, quae Psyche vocabatur, lodiculam in pavimento diligenter
extendit...

Sollicitavit inguina mea mille iam mortibus frigida. ...

Operuerat Ascyltos pallio caput, admonitus scilicet periculosum esse
alienis intervenire secretis...

Duas institas ancilla protulit de sinu alteraque pedes nostros
alligavit, altera manus.  <. . .>

Ascyltos, iam deficiente fabularum contextu: "Quid? Ego, inquit, non sum
dignus qui bibam?" Ancilla risu meo prodita complosit manus et:
"Apposui: quidem...adulescens, solus tantum medicamentum ebibisti? -- Itane
est? inquit Quartilla, quicquid saturei fuit, Encolpius ebibit?" Non
indecenti risu latera commovit. Ac ne Giton quidem ultimo risum tenuit,
utique postquam virguncula cervicem eius invasit et non repugnanti puero
innumerabilia oscula dedit.


"Prithee, lady", I said, "if you are preparing something worse, kill us
quickly; for neither of us have committed such a great crime that we
should die by torture."...

The maid, who was called Psyche, carefully spread a coverlet on the
floor... 

She agitated my sex organs, already as cold as a thousand deaths...

Ascyltos had covered his head with his cloak, certain of the advice that
to intervene in the secrets of others is dangerous....

The maid drew two of her dress bands out from under her breasts and
bound our feet with one, and our hands with the other...

Ascyltos, as her weaving of tales fell silent: "What?", he said, "I'm
not deserving of a drink?"  The maid, produced by my laughter, clapped
her hands and: "I served it, indeed... youth, have you drunk the
medicine up all by yourself? -- "Really?" said Quartilla, has Encolpius
drunk up all of the satyricon?...

Her sides shook with not unbecoming laughter.  And indeed Giton no longer
held in his laughter, leastways after the girl took possession of his
neck and gave innumerable kisses to the not unwilling boy.
