[XXI] 

Volebamus miseri exclamare, sed nec in auxilio erat quisquam, et hinc Psyche
acu comatoria cupienti mihi invocare Quiritum fidem malas pungebat, illinc
puella penicillo, quod et ipsum satureo tinxerat, Ascylton
opprimebat. <. . .>

Vltimo cinaedus supervenit myrtea subornatus gausapa cinguloque succinctus
. . . modo extortis nos clunibus cecidit, modo basiis olidissimis
inquinavit, donec Quartilla, ballaenaceam tenens virgam alteque succincta,
iussit infelicibus dari missionem.  <. . .>

Vterque nostrum religiosissimis iuravit verbis inter duos periturum esse tam
horribile secretum. ...

Intraverunt palaestritae quamplures et nos legitimo perfusos oleo
refecerunt. Vtcunque ergo lassitudine abiecta cenatoria repetimus et in
proximam cellam ducti sumus, in qua tres lecti strati erant et reliquus
lautitiarum apparatus splendidissime expositus. Iussi ergo discubuimus, et
gustatione mirifica initiati vino etiam Falerno inundamur. Excepti etiam
pluribus ferculis cum laberemur in somnum: "Itane est? inquit Quartilla,
etiam dormire vobis in mente est, cum sciatis Priapi genio pervigilium
deberi?" <. . .>


We wretches wanted to cry out, but there was no one to help, and hence
Psyche pricked my cheeks with her hairpin when I desired to call on the
faithful citizenry, while on the other side the girl overwhelmed Ascyltos
with a brush that had been dipped in satyricon....

Finally a catamite arrived, adorned with a myrtle-colored cloak cinched up
with a belt... he now smote us with his twisted buttocks, and now smeared
us with stinking kisses, while Quartilla, holding a whalebone staff and
belted high up, ordered that a reprieve be given to the unfortunates. ...

Both of us swore in the most solemn words that such an awful secret would
perish with us....

Several wrestlers came in and restored us, pouring genuine oil on us.
Thus having cast off our weariness we return to the dinner dress and were
led into the next room, in which three couches had been laid out and the
remaining equipment of luxury had been most splendidly set out.  Ordered
then to sit down, and were initiated with amazing appetizers, and were
even inundated with Falerian wine. Yet these had replaced with many more
courses when we slipped into sleep:  "Is it so?" said Quartilla, "that you
even have it in mind to sleep, when you know that the vigil to the genius of
Pripapius must be held?" ...
