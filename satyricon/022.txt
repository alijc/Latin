[XXII] 

Cum Ascyltos gravatus tot malis in somnum laberetur, illa quae iniuria
depulsa fuerat ancilla totam faciem eius fuligine longa perfricuit, et
non sentientis labra umerosque sopitionibus pinxit.

Iam ego etiam tot malis fatigatus minimum veluti gustum hauseram
somni; idem et tota intra forisque familia fecerat, atque alii circa
pedes discumbentium sparsi iacebant, alii parietibus appliciti, quidam
in ipso limine coniunctis manebant capitibus; lucernae quoque umore
defectae tenue et extremum lumen spargebant, cum duo Syri expilaturi
lagoenam triclinium intraverunt, dumque inter argentum avidius
rixantur, diductam fregerunt lagoenam. Cecidit etiam mensa cum
argento, et ancillae super torum marcentis excussum forte altius
poculum caput <fere> fregit.

Ad quem ictum exclamavit illa, pariterque et fures prodidit et partem
ebriorum excitavit. Syri illi qui venerant ad praedam, postquam
deprehensos se intellexerunt, pariter secundum lectum conciderunt, ut
putares hoc convenisse, et stertere tanquam olim dormientes coeperunt.

Iam et tricliniarches experrectus lucernis occidentibus oleum
infuderat, et pueri detersis paulisper oculis redierant ad
ministerium, cum intrans cymbalistria et concrepans aera omnes
excitavit.

 After Ascyltos, oppressed by so many evils, had slipped into sleep,
 the maid who had been driven repelled rubbed streaks of soot all over
 his whole face, and painted his lips and shoulders with limp pricks.

 Even I was already wearied by so many evils, just as I had swallowed
 the smallest taste of sleep; as the whole household, inside and out,
 was likewise doing, and some were scattered, lying down around the
 feet of those already reclining, others nestled against the walls,
 and some camped out on the very threshhold, with joined heads; even
 the lamp oil had run out and the lamps gave out a faint dying light,
 when two Syrians came in to plunder a dining room flagon, and while
 they're so greedily brawling among the silver, they broke the flagon
 that they were fighting over.  Even the table with the silver fell,
 and a cup, perchance thrown down from higher up, nearly broke the
 head of an exhausted maid lying on a bolster.

 She cried out at the blow, and equally both exposed the thieves and
 aroused a part of the drunk people.  The Syrians who had come for
 plunder, after realized that they'd been discovered, fell upon the
 next couch together, as if they'd agreed on it beforehand, and fell
 to snoring, as if they'd been sleeping.

 By now even the table server had woken up and had filled the failing
 lamps with oil, and the boys had returned to their service, wiping
 their eyes, while a cymbal-player, entering noisily, woke everyone
 up.
