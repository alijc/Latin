[XXIII] 

Refectum igitur est convivium et rursus Quartilla ad bibendum revocavit.
Adiuvit hilaritatem comissantis cymbalistria....

Intrat cinaedus, homo omnium insulsissimus et plane illa domo dignus, qui
ut infractis manibus congemuit, eiusmodi carmina effudit:

Huc huc convenite nunc, spatalocinaedi,
pede tendite, cursum addite, convolate planta,
femore facili, clune agili et manu procaces,
molles, veteres, Deliaci manu recisi.

Consumptis versibus suis immundissimo me basio conspuit. Mox et super
lectum venit atque omni vi detexit recusantem. Super inguina mea diu
multumque frustra moluit. Profluebant per frontem sudantis acaciae rivi,
et inter rugas malarum tantum erat cretae, ut putares detectum parietem
nimbo laborare.

 Therefore the banquet was restored and Quartilla again called for
 drinking. The cymbal-played helped the lightheartedness with her
 revelries....

 A catamite enters, the most insipid man of all, and clearly worthy of
 that house, who, while he loadly groaned with cracked hands, poured out
 a poem of suchlike:

  Assemble here now, you lewd people,
  stretch your foot, increase your speed, flock with your heel,
  with an easy thigh, a nimble butt and a wanton hand,
  soft ones, old ones, pruned by the hand of Delos.

 When he'd exhausted his verses he slobbered a most filthy kiss on
 me. Then he climbed atop my couch and exposed me all his strength,
 despite my resistance. For a long time he ground against my crotch in
 vain. There flowed down his face streams of sweating resin, and between
 the wrinkles of his cheeks was so much chalk, that you'd've thought that
 it was a wall laid bare by a rainstorm.
