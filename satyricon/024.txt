[XXIV] 

Non tenui ego diutius lacrimas, sed ad ultimam perductus
tristitiam: "Quaeso, inquam, domina, certe embasicoetan iusseras
dari." Complosit illa tenerius manus et: "O, inquit, hominem acutum
atque urbanitatis vernaculae fontem! Quid? Tu non intellexeras
cinaedum embasicoetan vocari?" Deinde ne contubernali meo melius
succederet: "Per fidem, inquam, vestram, Ascyltos in hoc triclinio
solus ferias agit?--Ita, inquit Quartilla, et Ascylto embasicoetas
detur". Ab hac voce equum cinaedus mutavit, transituque ad comitem
meum facto clunibus eum basiisque distrivit. Stabat inter haec
Giton et risu dissolvebat ilia sua. Itaque conspicata eum
Quartilla, cuius esset puer diligentissima sciscitatione
quaesivit. Cum ego fratrem meum esse dixissem: "Quare ergo, inquit,
me non basiavit?" vocatumque ad se in osculum adplicuit. Mox manum
etiam demisit in sinum et pertractato vasculo tam rudi: "Haec,
inquit, belle cras in promulside libidinis nostrae militabit; hodie
enim post asellum diaria non sumo".


 I didn't hold my tears for long, but was led to the ultimate
 sorrow: "I ask you," I said, "lady, surely you'd ordered a
 obscene-cup to be given to me."  She clapped her delicate hands
 and: "O," she said, "a clever man and a font of sophisticated
 speech!  What? Don't you realize that a catamite is called an
 obscene-cup?" Then, lest it follow more softly to my companion:
 "By your faith," I said, "does only Ascyltos on this couch get a
 rest?"  

 "So", said Quartilla, " and let Ascyltos be given an
 obscene-cup." At this expression the catamite changed horses, and
 the making the transfer to my comrade, he bruised him with his
 butt and kisses.  

 Giton was standing among them, and melting with laughter in his
 flanks.  And so when Quartilla noticed him, she asked, in a most
 careful question, whose boy he was.  When I said that he was my
 brother: "How then", she said, "did he not kiss me?" and having
 called him to her locked onto his lips.  She soon even dropped her
 hand into his lap and having felt his little prick with her staff:
 "This," she said, "flower will serve our lust as a first course
 tomorrow; for today I don't obtain my daily dose after a young
 ass."
