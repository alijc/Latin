[XXV]

Cum haec diceret, ad aurem eius Psyche ridens accessit et cum dixisset
nescio quid: "Ita, ita, inquit Quartilla, bene admonuisti. Cur non,
quia bellissima occasio est, devirginatur Pannychis nostra?"
Continuoque producta est puella satis bella et quae non plus quam
septem annos habere videbatur, ea ipsa quae primum cum Quartilla in
cellam venerat nostram. Plaudentibus ergo universis et postulantibus
nuptias, obstupui ego et nec Gitona, verecundissimum puerum, sufficere
huic petulantiae adfirmavi, nec puellam eius aetatis esse, ut
muliebris patientiae legem posset accipere." Ita, inquit Quartilla,
minor est ista quam ego fui, cum primum virum passa sum? Iunonem meam
iratam habeam, si unquam me meminerim virginem fuisse. Nam et infans
cum paribus inquinata sum, et subinde procedentibus annis maioribus me
pueris adplicui, donec ad hanc aetatem perveni. Hinc etiam puto
proverbium natum illud, ut dicatur posse taurum tollere, qui vitulum
sustulerit." Igitur ne maiorem iniuriam in secreto frater acciperet,
consurrexi ad officium nuptiale.

 When she said these words, Psyche, laughing, approached her ear, and
 after she'd said I know not what: "So, so," said Quartilla, "you have
 suggested well.  Why not, for the opportunity is most agreeable, for
 our Pannychis to be deflowered?"  And straightway they brought out a
 girl, pretty enough and who seemed to be no more than seven years
 old, the very same who had come into our room with Quartilla in the
 first place.  So, with everyone applauding and demanding a wedding, I
 was struck dumb and I asserted that Giton, that most modest boy,
 wasn't sufficient to this wantonness, nor was the girl of an age that
 the law could accept her womanly submission.  "So," said Quartilla,
 "isn't this one younger than I was, when I first endured a man?"  I
 would have my Juno angry, if I ever remembered being a virgin.  For
 both I was, as an infant, polluted by my equals, and thereupon with
 greater advancing years I hooked up with boys, until I reached my
 present age. Yet I think from this that the local proverb that says,
 that who carries the calf can carry the bull." 

 Therefore, lest my brother get greater harm in secret, I rose for the
 wedding service.
