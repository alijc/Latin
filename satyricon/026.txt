[XXVI] 

Iam Psyche puellae caput involverat flammeo, iam embasicoetas
praeferebat facem, iam ebriae mulieres longum agmen plaudentes
fecerant, thalamumque incesta exornaverant veste. Tum Quartilla quoque
iocantium libidine accensa et ipsa surrexit, correptumque Gitona in
cubiculum traxit.

Sine dubio non repugnaverat puer, ac ne puella quidem tristis expaverat
nuptiarum nomen. Itaque cum inclusi iacerent, consedimus ante limen
thalami, et in primis Quartilla per rimam improbe diductam adplicuerat
oculum curiosum, lusumque puerilem libidinosa speculabatur
diligentia. Me quoque ad idem spectaculum lenta manu traxit, et quia
considerantium <co>haeserant vultus, quicquid a spectaculo vacabat,
commovebat obiter labra et me tamquam furtivis subinde osculis
verberabat. <. . .>

Abiecti in lectis sine metu reliquam exegimus noctem. <. . .>

Venerat iam tertius dies, id est expectatio liberae cenae, sed tot
vulneribus confossis fuga magis placebat quam quies. Itaque cum maesti
deliberaremus quonam genere praesentem evitaremus procellam, unus
servus Agamemnonis interpellavit trepidantes et: "Quid? vos, inquit,
nescitis hodie apud quem fiat? Trimalchio, lautissimus homo. Horologium
in triclinio et bucinatorem habet subornatum, ut subinde sciat quantum
de vita perdiderit!"

Amicimur ergo diligenter obliti omnium malorum et Gitona libentissime
servile officium tuentem iubemus in balneum sequi.

 Psyche had already covered the girl's head with a bridal veil, 
 and the obscene cup was already carrying the torch, the drunk women,
 clapping, had already made a long processional line, and the marriage
 bed had been adorned with a lewd blanket.  Then Quartilla, fired with
 the wantonness of the jests, stood up herself, seized Giton and
 dragged him into the bedroom.

 Without doubt the boy had not fought back, and besides the girl had
 certainly not become frightened with sorrow at the name of the
 nuptials. And do when they shut them up together, we settled in front
 of the threshold of the bedchamber, and at first Quartilla applied a
 curious eye to a crack that had been wickedly opened, and observed the
 playing children with wanton attentiveness.  She also gently drew me
 by the hand to the same show, and because our faces were stuck
 together in comtemplation, whenever free from the spectacle provoked
 her lips and she smacked me repeatedly with furtive kisses....

 Cast down on the bed we finished out the rest of the night without
 dread... 

 When the third day arrived, that is, the expectation of a free dinner,
 but, punctured by so many wounds, flight is more pleasing than rest.
 And so while we considered the gloomy by which we might avoid the
 present storm, a servant of Agamemnon broken in on our trembling and:
 "What? You," he said, "don't know at whose house today will take
 place? At Trimalchio's, that most sumptuous man.  His dining room
 comes equipped with a clock and a trumpeter, so that he might know
 immediately how much of life he has lost!"

 Therefore we are carefully dressed, having forgotten all of the evil
 things and order Giton, freeing upholding his servile office, to
 follow us to the public bath.
