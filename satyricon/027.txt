[XXVII] 

Nos interim vestiti errare coepimus, immo iocari magis et circulis
[ludentem] accedere, cum subito videmus senem calvum, tunica
vestitum russea, inter pueros capillatos ludentem pila. Nec tam
pueri nos, quamquam erat operae pretium, ad spectaculum duxerant,
quam ipse pater familiae, qui soleatus pila prasina
exercebatur. Nec amplius eam repetebat quae terram contigerat, sed
follem plenum habebat servus sufficiebatque ludentibus. Notavimus
etiam res novas: nam duo spadones in diversa parte circuli
stabant, quorum alter matellam tenebat argenteam, alter numerabat
pilas, non quidem eas quae inter manus lusu expellente vibrabant,
sed eas quae in terram decidebant.

Cum has ergo miraremur lautitias, accurrit Menelaus: "Hic est,
inquit, apud quem cubitum ponitis, et quidem iam principium cenae
videtis." Et iam non loquebatur Menelaus cum Trimalchio digitos
concrepuit, ad quod signum matellam spado ludenti
subiecit. Exonerata ille vesica aquam poposcit ad manus,
digitosque paululum adspersos in capite pueri tersit.

 In the meantime we, now dressed, began to wander about, no
 indeed, to jest all the more and to approach the playing circles,
 when suddenly we see a bald old man, dressed in a reddish tunic,
 playing with a ball among the long-haired boys.  And not much to
 us were the boys, although they were a worthwhile work, that drew
 us to the show, but rather the head of the household himself,
 who, slippered, was exercising with a green ball.  And he didn't
 retrieve it when touched the ground, but a slave had a bagful and
 doled them out to the players.  We also observed new things: for
 two eunuchs were standing on opposite sides of the circle, of
 whom one held a chamberpot, and the other counted balls, not even
 the ones that were expelled in a flash between the hands in play,
 but the ones that fell to the ground.

 While we were admiring these luxuries, Menelaus rushed up: "This
 is he," he said, "at whose house the spread is laid out, and you
 are seeing the beginning of the dinner."  Menelaus had barely
 finished speaking when Trimalchio snapped his fingers, at which
 signal the eunuch placed the chamberpot under the player.  After
 unburdening his bladder he demanded water to hand, and having
 sprinkled a bit on his fingers, wiped them on the head of a boy.
