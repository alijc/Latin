[XXVIII] 

Longum erat singula excipere. Itaque intravimus balneum, et sudore
calfacti momento temporis ad frigidam eximus. Iam Trimalchio unguento
perfusus tergebatur, non linteis, sed palliis ex lana mollissima
factis. Tres interim iatraliptae in conspectu eius Falernum potabant,
et cum plurimum rixantes effunderent, Trimalchio hoc suum propinasse
dicebat. Hinc involutus coccina gausapa lecticae impositus est
praecedentibus phaleratis cursoribus quattuor et chiramaxio, in quo
deliciae eius vehebantur, puer vetulus, lippus, domino Trimalchione
deformior. Cum ergo auferretur, ad caput eius symphoniacus cum
minimis tibiis accessit et tanquam in aurem aliquid secreto diceret,
toto itinere cantavit.

Sequimur nos admiratione iam saturi et cum Agamemnone ad ianuam
pervenimus, in cuius poste libellus erat cum hac inscriptione fixus:

QVISQVIS SERVVS SINE DOMINICO IVSSV FORAS EXIERIT ACCIPIET PLAGAS CENTVM.

In aditu autem ipso stabat ostiarius prasinatus, cerasino succinctus
cingulo, atque in lance argentea pisum purgabat. Super limen autem
cavea pendebat aurea in qua pica varia intrantes salutabat.

 It was tedious to follow each thing.  And so we entered the bath,
 and after getting all hot and sweaty, in one moment went out into
 the cold room.  Trimalchio was already getting rubbed down with a
 coat of oil, not with linen cloths, but with a cloak made of softest
 wool.  Meanwhile three masseurs drank Falernian wine in his sight,
 and after they had spilled much of it brawlling, Trimalchio called
 this drinking to his health.  From here, wrapped in a scarlet cloak,
 he was inflicted on a litter with four adorned runners, and a
 hand-cart in which was borne Trimalchio's pet, a rather malformed
 aging boy with rheumy eyes. And so, while he was being borne away,
 an orchestra with tiny flutes approached and played for the whole
 trip, as if they whispered a secret into his ear.

 We followed, already sated with astonishment, and together with
 Agamemnon reached the door, on which was posted a pamplet fastened
 with this inscription:

 ANY SLAVE THAT GOES OUT WITHOUT THE MASTER'S COMMAND WILL GET 100 LASHES.
 
 But in the very entryway stood a porter, clad in green, with a
 cherry-red belt, and he picked over peas in a silver dish.  A gold
 birdcage hung above the threshhold in which a black-and-white magpie
 greeted those entering.
