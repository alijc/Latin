[XXIX] 

Ceterum ego dum omnia stupeo, paene resupinatus crura mea
fregi. Ad sinistram enim intrantibus non longe ab ostiarii cella
canis ingens, catena vinctus, in pariete erat pictus superque
quadrata littera scriptum

  CAVE CANEM.

Et collegae quidem mei riserunt. Ego autem collecto spiritu non
destiti totum parientem persequi. Erat autem venalicium <cum>
titulis pictis, et ipse Trimalchio capillatus caduceum tenebat
Minervamque ducente Romam intrabat. Hinc quemadmodum ratiocinari
didicisset, deinque dispensator factus esset, omnia diligenter
curiosus pictor cum inscriptione reddiderat. In deficiente vero
iam porticu levatum mento in tribunal excelsum Mercurius
rapiebat. Praesto erat Fortuna cornu abundanti copiosa et tres
Parcae aurea pensa torquentes. Notavi etiam in porticu gregem
cursorum cum magistro se exercentem. Praeterea grande armarium
in angulo vidi, in cuius aedicula erant Lares argentei positi
Venerisque signum marmoreum et pyxis aurea non pusilla, in qua
barbam ipsius conditam esse dicebant. 

Interrogare ergo atriensem coepi, quas in medio picturas
haberent." Iliada et Odyssian, inquit, ac Laenatis gladiatorium
munus."

 Moreover, while I was in stupification at it all, I nearly
 broke my leg falling over backwards.  For to the left of those
 entering, not far from the door, the pen of a huge dog,
 chained, was painted on the wall and over it in square
 letters was written

     BEWARE THE DOG

 And indeed my companions laughed at me.  But I gathered my
 breath and didn't stop from examining the whole wall.  Now
 there was a slave market with painted placards, and Trimalchio
 himself, with long hair, was carrying Mercury's staff, and
 leading Minerva into Rome.  From here, in whatever way he had
 learned his arithmetic, and had next become a steward, and the
 painstaking painter had carefully rendered everything with an
 inscription.  As the porch was giving out, Mercury was dragging
 him, now bald, by the chin into the high tribunal.  Fortune was
 at hand with her horn of plenty, and the three Fates were
 spinning with a gold thread.  Furthermore I noticed there was a
 herd of runners in the porch training with a master.  I also
 saw a tall cabinet in the corner, a shrine in which silver
 Lares had been placed as well as a marble seal of Venus and a
 not trifling gold casket, in which they said his beard had been
 stored away. 

 And so I began to ask the steward, what paintings they had
 inside.  "The Iliad and the Odyssey," he said, "and the
 gladiatorial show of Laenas."
