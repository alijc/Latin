[XXX] 

Non licebat <tam multa otiose> considerare. Nos iam ad triclinium
perveneramus, in cuius parte prima procurator rationes
accipiebat. Et quod praecipue miratus sum, in postibus triclinii
fasces erant cum securibus fixi, quorum imam partem quasi embolum
navis aeneum finiebat, in quo erat scriptum:

C. POMPEIO TRIMALCHIONI SEVIRO AVGVSTALI CINNAMVS DISPENSATOR.

Sub eodem titulo et lucerna bilychnis de camera pendebat, et duae
tabulae in utroque poste defixae, quarum altera, si bene memini,
hoc habebat inscriptum:

III ET PRIDIE KALENDAS IANVARIAS C. NOSTER FORAS CENAT,

altera lunae cursum stellarumque septem imagines pictas; et qui
dies boni quique incommodi essent, distinguente bulla notabantur.

His repleti voluptatibus cum conaremur in triclinium intrare,
exclamavit unus ex pueris, qui super hoc officium erat positus:
"Dextro pede!" Sine dubio paulisper trepidavimus, ne contra
praeceptum aliquis nostrum limen transiret.  Ceterum ut pariter
movimus dextros gressus, servus nobis despoliatus procubuit ad
pedes ac rogare coepit, ut se poenae eriperemus: nec magnum esse
peccatum suum, propter quod periclitaretur; subducta enim sibi
vestimenta dispensatoris in balneo, quae vix fuissent decem
sestertiorum. Retulimus ergo dextros pedes, dispensatoremque in
atrio aureos numerantem deprecati sumus ut servo remitteret
poenam. Superbus ille sustulit vultum et: "Non tam iactura me
movet, inquit, quam neglegentia nequissimi servi. Vestimenta mea
cubitoria perdidit, quae mihi natali meo cliens quidam donaverat,
Tyria sine dubio, sed iam semel lota. Quid ergo est? dono vobis
eum."

 I was not allowed the time to look closely at so many things.
 We had already reached the dining room, in the outer part of
 which the overseer was receiving accounts.  And I especially
 marvelled that faggots and axes had been fastened to the
 doorposts of the dining room, whose inner part was finished like
 the copper beak of a ship, on which was written:

 TO C. POMPEIUS TRIMALCHIO THE SEVIR OF AUGUSTUS FROM CINNAMUS HIS STEWARD

 Under this placard a double-wicked lamp was hanging from the
 ceiling, and two tablets were fastened on the doorposts.  One of
 them, if I remember right, had this inscription:

 TWO DAYS BEFORE JANUARY 1 OUR MASTER DINES OUT

 and the other had the course of the moon and images of the seven
 planets drawn; and which days would be lucky and which unlucky,
 with different studs.

 Filled with these delights, when we tried to enter the dining room, 
 one of the boys, who was positioned above this office, cried out:
 "With the right foot!"  Without doubt, we trembled a little,
 lest we cross the threshold against orders.  Moreover, just as
 we moved our right feet together, a stripped slave threw himself
 down at our feet and began to beg us to rescue him from
 punishment: that his offense hadn't been great, because of what
 he proved; for the clothing of the steward had been carried off
 in the bathhouse, which barely made ten sesterces.  And so we
 recalled our right feet, and entreated the steward who was
 counting up gold coins in the atrium to diminish the slave's
 punishment.  That haughty man raised his head and said: "It's
 not the loss that upsets me, but the negligence of the slave.
 He lost my dinner clothes, that a certain client had given to me
 for my birthday, Tyrian purple without doubt, only washed once.
 And so that's that.  I give him to you.
