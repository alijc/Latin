[XXXI] 

Obligati tam grandi beneficio cum intrassemus triclinium, occurrit nobis
ille idem servus, pro quo rogaveramus, et stupentibus spississima basia
impegit gratias agens humanitati nostrae." Ad summam, statim scietis,
ait, cui dederitis beneficium. Vinum dominicum ministratoris gratia
est."...

Tandem ergo discubuimus, pueris Alexandrinis aquam in manus nivatam
infundentibus, aliisque insequentibus ad pedes ac paronychia cum ingenti
subtilitate tollentibus. Ac ne in hoc quidem tam molesto tacebant
officio, sed obiter cantabant. Ego experiri volui an tota familia
cantaret, itaque potionem poposci. Paratissimus puer non minus me acido
cantico excepit, et quisquis aliquid rogatus erat ut daret. Pantomimi
chorum, non patris familiae triclinium crederes.  Allata est tamen
gustatio valde lauta; nam iam omnes discubuerant praeter ipsum
Trimachionem, cui locus novo more primus servabatur. Ceterum in
promulsidari asellus erat Corinthius cum bisaccio positus, qui habebat
olivas in altera parte albas, in altera nigras. Tegebant asellum duae
lances, in quarum marginibus nomen Trimalchionis inscriptum erat et
argenti pondus. Ponticuli etiam ferruminati sustinebant glires melle ac
papavere sparsos. Fuerunt et tomacula supra craticulam argenteam
ferventia posita et infra craticulam Syriaca pruna cum granis Punici
mali.

 We were greatly obliged by this kindness, and when we had entered the
 dining-room, it happened that the very same slave for whom we had asked
 the favor thrust dense kisses on our astonished selves.  "To the
 utmost, you'll soon discover," he said, "to whom you have given this
 kindness.  The master's wine is the thanks of those serving." ....

 And so we at last took our places.  Boys from Alexandria poured chilled
 water on our hands.  Others followed and gave us pedicures with great
 dexterity.  And they were not silent in this so very tiresome duty, but
 sang as they went.  I wanted to see if the entire household would sing,
 and so asked for a drink.  The readiest slave took my order in a shrill
 song, as did anyone else who was asked to bring something.  You'd've
 thought it a chorus of pantomines, not a householder's dining-room.
 Yet the first course that was brought in was very elegant; for already
 everyone had sat down except for Trimalchio himself, for whom the first
 place was saved, in the new-fangled way of things.  Moreover, on a tray
 there was a Corinthian ass set up with a pair of saddle-bags, which
 held white olives in one part, and black in the other.  The ass was
 covered by two plates, in whose margins the name of Trimalchio and
 their weight had been written in silver.  Little soldered bridges
 supported dormice that had been sprinkled with honey and poppyseed.
 There were hot sausages above a silver grill, and under the grill were
 Syrian plums(pun on charcoal) with seeds of pomegranate.
