[XXXII] 

In his eramus lautitiis, cum Trimalchio ad symphoniam allatus est,
positusque inter cervicalia minutissima expressit imprudentibus
risum. Pallio enim coccineo adrasum excluserat caput, circaque
oneratas veste cervices laticlaviam immiserat mappam fimbriis hinc
atque illinc pendentibus. Habebat etiam in minimo digito sinistrae
manus anulum grandem subauratum, extremo vero articulo digiti
sequentis minorem, ut mihi videbatur, totum aureum, sed plane
ferreis veluti stellis ferruminatum. Et ne has tantum ostenderet
divitias, dextrum nudavit lacertum armilla aurea cultum et eboreo
circulo lamina splendente conexo.

 We were in these splendors, when Trimalchio was announced to the
 accompaniment of the orchestra, and as he was placed among dainty
 pillows laughter was expressed by the incautious.  For his shaved
 head was thrust out of his scarlet cloak, and around the heaped
 up necks of his clothing he had inserted a napkin with a broad
 crimson stripe and fringes hanging down here and there.  He even
 had a huge gilded ring on the little finger of his left hand,
 with a smaller one on the last joint of the next one, that seemed
 to me, pure gold, but with iron stars soldered onto it.  And lest
 he this wasn't enough wealth to show off, he had his 
 right arm bare and cultivated with a gold armband and an ivory
 ring with a glittering metal clasp.
