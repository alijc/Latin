[XXXIII] 

Vt deinde pinna argentea dentes perfodit: "Amici, inquit, nondum mihi
suave erat in triclinium venire, sed ne diutius absentivos morae
vobis essem, omnem voluptatem mihi negavi. Permittetis tamen finiri
lusum." Sequebatur puer cum tabula terebinthina et crystallinis
tesseris, notavique rem omnium delicatissimam. Pro calculis enim
albis ac nigris aureos argenteosque habebat denarios.  

Interim dum ille omnium textorum dicta inter lusum consumit,
gustantibus adhuc nobis repositorium allatum est cum corbe, in quo
gallina erat lignea patentibus in orbem alis, quales esse solent quae
incubant ova. Accessere continuo duo servi et symphonia strepente
scrutari paleam coeperunt, erutaque subinde pavonina ova divisere
convivis. Convertit ad hanc scenam Trimalchio vultum et: "Amici, ait,
pavonis ova gallinae iussi supponi. Et mehercules timeo ne iam
concepti sint. Temptemus tamen, si adhuc sorbilia sunt." Accipimus
nos cochlearia non minus selibras pendentia, ovaque ex farina pingui
figurata pertundimus. Ego quidem paene proieci partem meam, nam
videbatur mihi iam in pullum coisse. Deinde ut audivi veterem
convivam: "Hic nescio quid boni debet esse", persecutus putamen manu,
pinguissimam ficedulam inveni piperato vitello circumdatam.

 Then, as he picked his teeth with a silver feather: "Friends," he
 said, "it wasn't yet agreeable for me to come into the dining-room,
 but rather than staying away from you, I denied myself all of my
 pleasures. But you will permit me to finish my game."  There
 followed a boy with a tablet made of turpentine wood and crystal
 dice. I noticed something most refined of all.  For instead of white
 and black pieces it had gold and silver coins. 

 In the meantime, while he burned up the speech of all weavers in the
 game, a tray with a basket was brought to us, who were still eating,
 in which was a wooden hen, with her wings in a circle, as if she
 were brooding over her eggs.  Immediately two slaves approached, and
 as the orchestra resounded began to search through the chaff, and
 thereupon dug out peahen eggs to share out to the guests.
 Trimalchio turned his face to this scene and said, "Friends, I
 ordered peahen eggs to be put under the hen.  And, by Hercules, I
 fear that they are already half-hatched.  Nevertheless let us try
 them, if they can be sucked up."  We take up our spoons (weighing no
 less than half a pound, and break open the eggs, formed from flour
 and fat.  Indeed I nearly threw my share away, for it seemed to me
 already knit into a chick.  Then I heard an experienced guest say,
 "I don't know what good thing should be here", and attacking the
 shell with my hand, found the fattest little fig-pecker surrounded
 with a peppery yolk.
