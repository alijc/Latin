ADVENTURES OF ENCOLPIUS AND HIS COMPANIONS

CHAPTER THE FIRST.

Num alio genere furiarum declamatores inquietantur, qui clamant: 'haec
vulnera pro libertate publica excepi; hunc oculum pro vobis impendi: date
mihi ducem, qui me ducat ad liberos meos, nam succisi poplites membra non
sustinent'? Haec ipsa tolerabilia essent, si ad eloquentiam ituris viam
facerent. Nunc et rerum tumore et sententiarum vanissimo strepitu hoc tantum
proficiunt, ut cum in forum venerint, putent se in alium orbem terrarum
delatos. Et ideo ego adulescentulos existimo in scholis stultissimos fieri,
quia nihil ex his, quae in usu habemus, aut audiunt aut vident, sed piratas
cum catenis in litore stantes, sed tyrannos edicta scribentes, quibus
imperent filiis ut patrum suorum capita praecidant, sed responsa in
pestilentiam data, ut virgines tres aut plures immolentur, sed mellitos
verborum globulos et omnia dicta factaque quasi papavere et sesamo sparsa.

Does some new sort of Furies trouble the orators who cry: 'These wounds I
received for the sake of the public; this eye I lost for your sake; give me
a guide, who might lead me to my children, for my undercut knees can't
support my legs?'  These would be bearable, if they built the road that
leads to eloquence.  But they, by the swelling of circumstances and this
emptiest racket of opinions, only succeed in that when they come into the
forum, they think themselves conveyed into a different world.  And therefore
I myself consider that young men are brought up in schools to be very foolish,
for they hear or see nothing or reality in these, but rather
pirates in chains standing on the shore, or despots writing edicts that
command sons to behead their fathers, or oracles given during
the plague, ordering the sacrifice of three or more virgins; globules
sweetened with the honey of words and everything said and done as if strewn
with poppyseed and sesame.
