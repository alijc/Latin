CHAPTER THE THIRD.

 Non est passus Agamemnon me diutius declamare in porticu, quam ipse in schola
 sudaverat, sed “Adulescens” inquit “quoniam sermonem habes non publici saporis
 et, quod rarissimum est, amas bonam mentem, non fraudabo te arte
 secreta. Nihil nimirum in his exercitationibus doctores peccant, qui necesse
 habent cum insanientibus furere. Nam nisi dixerint quae adulescentuli probent,
 ut ait Cicero, 'soli in scholis relinquentur.' Sicut ficti adulatores cum
 cenas divitum captant, nihil prius meditantur quam id quod putant
 gratissimum auditoribus fore: nec enim aliter impetrabunt quod petunt,
 nisi quasdam insidias auribus fecerint: sic eloquentiae magister, nisi tanquam
 piscator eam imposuerit hamis escam, quam scierit appetituros esse pisciculos,
 sine spe praedae morabitur in scopulo.

Agamemnon did not suffer me to declaim in the portico for longer than he himself
had sweated in school, but said "Young man, because you have speech that is not
of the public taste and, what is most rare, you love a fine mind, I will not
deceive you with a secret art.  Without doubt, doctors, who must have to rage
with insane people, do nothing wrong in these exercises,  For unless they said
things that young people approve of, as Cicero said, 'they would be left alone
in schools.'  Such false flatterers, while they seek the dinners of rich men, 
consider nothing other than what they think will be most pleasing to their
listeners: for they would not otherwise get what they ask for, unless they
made a snare for the ears: so the teacher of eloquence, just as a fisherman,
unless he baits his hook with food that he knows that the little fish will be
striving for, will be idling on a rock with no hope of a catch."
