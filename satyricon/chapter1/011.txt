[XI] 

Postquam lustravi oculis totam urbem, in cellulam redii, osculisque tandem bona
fide exactis alligo artissimis complexibus puerum, fruorque votis usque ad
invidiam felicibus. Nec adhuc quidem omnia erant facta, cum Ascyltos furtim se
foribus admovit, discussisque fortissime claustris invenit me cum fratre
ludentem. Risu itaque plausuque cellulam implevit, opertum me amiculo evoluit
et: "Quid agebas, inquit, frater sanctissime? Quid? Vesti contubernium facis?"
Nec se solum intra verba continuit, sed lorum de pera soluit et me coepit non
perfunctorie verberare, adiectis etiam petulantibus dictis: "Sic dividere cum
fratre nolito."

After I eyeballed the whole town, I returned to my room, and 
having at last demanded kisses in good faith
I wrap the boy in the tightest of embraces,
and to enjoy ;) the happy vows even to the point of envy.
And indeed not yet was everything done, 
when Ascyltos stealthily drew near to the door,
and rattling the bolt with all his might, found me playing with my lover.
And so he filled the room with laughter and applause,
unfolded me from the cloak that covered me and said:
"What were you doing, my most august brother?  What?
Making love to your clothing?"
Nor did he go on with words alone, 
but loosened the strap from his bag and began to beat me, and not carelessly, 
even adding insulting remarks:
"Don't break up with your brother."
