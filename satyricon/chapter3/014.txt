[XIV] 

Contra Ascyltos leges timebat et: "Quis, aiebat, hoc loco nos novit, aut quis
habebit dicentibus fidem? Mihi plane placet emere, quamvis nostrum sit, quod
agnoscimus, et parvo aere recuperare potius thesaurum, quam in ambiguam litem
descendere:

Quid faciant leges, ubi sola pecunia regnat,
aut ubi paupertas vincere nulla potest?
Ipsi qui Cynica traducunt tempora pera,
non numquam nummis vendere vera solent.
Ergo iudicium nihil est nisi publica merces,
atque eques in causa qui sedet, empta probat."

Sed praeter unum dipondium, quo cicer lupinosque destinaveramus mercari,
nihil ad manum erat. Itaque ne interim praeda discederet, vel minoris
pallium addicere placuit ut pretium maioris compendii leviorem faceret
iacturam. Cum primum ergo explicuimus mercem, mulier operto capite, quae cum
rustico steterat, inspectis diligentius signis iniecit utramque laciniae
manum magnaque vociferatione latrones tenere clamavit. Contra nos
perturbati, ne videremur nihil agere, et ipsi scissam et sordidam tenere
coepimus tunicam atque eadem invidia proclamare, nostra esse spolia quae
illi possiderent. Sed nullo genere par erat causa, et cociones qui ad
clamorem confluxerant, nostram scilicet de more ridebant invidiam, quod pro
illa parte vindicabant pretiosissimam vestem, pro hac pannuciam ne
centonibus quidem bonis dignam. Hinc Ascyltos bene risum discussit, qui
silentio facto:


On the other hand Ascyltos was afraid of the law and said: 
"Who knows us in this place, or who will believe what we say?
It pleases me to simply buy it, even though what he claim is ours, 
and better to recover a treasure with a small fee, 
than to descend into a doubtful lawsuit.

What do the laws, where money alone rules,
or where poverty can't overcome a thing?
Even the Cynical times convert their bags,
and sometimes come to sell the truth for coin.
Therefore a trial is naught but public wares,
and the knight who sits on the suit, proves bought.

But other than two pennies, that we'd earmarked to buy chickpeas and lupine
beans. we had nothing at hand.  And so, in order to not abandon the spoils in
the meantime, it pleased us to sell the cloak for even less, so that the price
would turn a lighter loss into greater profit.  But then, when we unfolded the
first merchendise, a veiled woman, who had stopped with the country fellow,
carefully inspected the marks and struck into one hem with her hand and raised
the hue and cry.  With the alarmed people facing us, we seemed to do nothing,
and and ourselves began to hold the ripped and dirty tunic and raise our own hue
and cry, that it was our leavings that they had taken possession of.  But the
trial was in no way equal, and the dealers who flocked to the clamor naturally
ridiculed our ill will out of habit, because on their part they were claiming
the costlier garment, while on ours it wasn't even good enough to use for
patchwork.  From here Ascyltos shattered the laughter well, after quiet
happened.
