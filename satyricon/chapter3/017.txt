[XVII] 

Tacentibus adhuc nobis et ad neutram partem adsentationem flectentibus
intravit ipsa, una comitata virgine, sedensque super torum meum diu
flevit. Ac ne tunc quidem nos ullum adiecimus verbum, sed attoniti
expectavimus lacrimas ad ostentationem doloris paratas. Vt ergo tam
ambitiosus detonuit imber, retexit superbum pallio caput, et manibus
inter se usque ad articulorum strepitum constrictis: "Quaenam est,
inquit, haec audacia, aut ubi fabulas etiam antecessura latrocinia
didicistis? Misereor mediusfidius vestri; neque enim impune quisquam
quod non licuit, aspexit. Vtique nostra regio tam praesentibus plena
est numinibus, ut facilius possis deum quam hominem invenire. Ac ne me
putetis ultionis causa huc venisse; aetate magis vestra commoveor quam
iniuria mea. Imprudentes enim, ut adhuc puto, admisistis inexpiabile
scelus. Ipsa quidem illa nocte vexata tam periculoso inhorrui frigore,
ut tertianae etiam impetum timeam. Et ideo medicinam somnio petii,
iussaque sum vos perquirere atque impetum morbi monstrata subtilitate
lenire. Sed de remedio non tam valde laboro; maior enim in praecordiis
dolor saevit, qui me usque ad necessitatem mortis deducit, ne scilicet
iuvenili impulsi licentia quod in sacello Priapi vidistis vulgetis,
deorumque consilia proferatis in populum. Protendo igitur ad genua
vestra supinas manus, petoque et oro ne nocturnas religiones iocum
risumque faciatis, neve traducere velitis tot annorum secreta, quae vix
mille homines noverunt."

We kept silent, and without the leave of either of us she entered the
room with a bow, in the company of a young woman, and, sitting on my
bed, wept for a long time.  And indeed, not even then did we cast forth
even a single word, but looked on in amazement at the tears ready-made
for the display of sorrow.  And so, just as the showy shower was
exhausted, she drew her cloak off of her haughty head and, wringing her
hands until the joints cracked: "What is, she said, this audacity, and
where did you learn to outstrip even the robbers of tales?  Heaven
knows that I pity you; for not without inpunity does anyone gaze upon
that which is forbidden.  Certainly our country is so full of
auspicious divinity, so that you can more easily come upon a god than a
man.  And don't think that I came here for the sake of revenge, I am
moved more by your age than by my injury.  For you all unaware, as I
still think, have let loose a wickedness that is beyond
atonement. Indeed, this very night I, shaken, trembled with such a
dangerous chill that I even feared an attack of tertian fever. And
therefore I asked for a treatment in a dream, and was commanded to
search for you and to assuage the attack of sickness with the means
that was shown.  But I am not so greatly troubled about the remedy; for
a greater sorrow rages in my breast, that draws me all the way to the
necessity of death, that you not divulge with youthful liberty what you
saw in the shrine of Priapus, and speak of the counsels of the gods in
public.  Therefore I stretch out my upturned hands to your knees, and
ask and pray that you not jest at or ridicule our nocturnal rites, and
that you wouldn't want to exhibit the secrets of the ages, which hardly
a thousand people knew of.
