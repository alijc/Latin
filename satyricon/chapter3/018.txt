[XVIII]

Secundum hanc deprecationem lacrimas rursus effudit gemitibusque largis
concussa tota facie ac pectore torum meum pressit. Ego eodem tempore et
misericordia turbatus et metu, bonum animum habere eam iussi et de
utroque esse securam: nam neque sacra quemquam vulgaturum, et si quod
praeterea aliud remedium ad tertianam deus illi monstrasset,
adiuvaturos nos divinam providentiam vel periculo nostro. Hilarior post
hanc pollicitationem facta mulier basiavit me spissius, et ex lacrimis
in risum mota descendentes ab aure capillos meos lenta manu duxit et:
"Facio, inquit, indutias vobiscum, et a constituta lite dimitto. Quod
si non adnuissetis de hac medicina quam peto, iam parata erat in
crastinum turba, quae et iniuriam meam vindicaret et dignitatem:

 Contemni turpe est, legem donare superbum;
 hoc amo, quod possum qua libet ire via.
 Nam sane et sapiens contemptus iurgia nectit,
 et qui non iugulat, victor abire solet.

Complosis deinde manibus in tantum repente risum effusa est, ut
timeremus. Idem ex altera parte et ancilla fecit, quae prior venerat,
idem virguncula, quae una intraverat.

Right after this entreaty she once more poured forth tears and, shaken
with bountiful sighs, pressed her whole face and breast into my bed.
At the time I, thrown into confusion with both pity and dread,
commanded her to take courage and to be free from care in both regards:
for neither of us would divulge anything sacred, and in addition, if
the god had shown her some remedy for tertinary fever, we would aid
divine providence, despite any danger to ourselves.  

More cheerful after this promise had been made, the woman kissed my
more closely, and, moved from tears to laughter, drawing the hair that
fell from my ears with a pliant hand, and said:

"I will make a truce with you, and dismiss the drawn-up lawsuit.
But if you had not agreed about this treatment that I ask for, 
I had already prepared a mob for the morrow, which
would avenge both my injury and my dignity:

 To be scorned is hateful, to give laws is arrogant;
 I love this, because I can go my which road I may.
 For certainly a wise man, when scorned, binds quarrels,
 and who doesn't cut throats, is want to emerge the victor.

Then, clapping her hands, she suddenly poured out such great laughter
that we were frightened.  And her maid, who had previously entered from
another side, did the same, and also a little girl, who had come in alone.
