Sudorem ille manibus detersit et: "Si scires, inquit, quae mihi
acciderunt. -- Quid novi?" inquam ego. At ille deficiens: "Cum errarem, inquit,
per totam civitatem nec invenirem quo loco stabulum reliquissem, accessit ad me
pater familiae et ducem se itineris humanissime promisit. Per anfractus deinde
obscurissimos egressus in hunc locum me perduxit, prolatoque peculis coepit
rogare stuprum. Iam pro cella meretrix assem exegerat, iam ille mihi iniecerat
manum et nisi valentior fuissem, dedissem poenas.

He wiped away the sweat with his hands and said: "If you only knew,
what has happened to me."  "What is it?" says I. And he, fainting, says:
"After I got lost, and didn't find, all through the city, where
I'd left our inn, a householder came up to me and 
most kindly offered himself as a guide.  Then he led me through the 
darkest winding passages to this place, brought out money and
began to ask for sex.  A prostitute had already exacted 
a penny for a room, he had already punched me and,
had I not been stronger than him, I would have paid the price.

Indeed everyone everywhere seemed to me to have been drinking aphrodisiacs.

by combined forces we avoided the troubler.
