[IX] 

Quasi per caliginem vidi Gitona in crepidine semitae stantem et in eundem
locum me conieci. Cum quaererem numquid nobis in prandium frater
parasset, consedit puer super lectum et manantes lacrumas pollice
extersit. Perturbatus ego habitu fratris, quid accidisset quaesivi. Et
ille tarde quidem et invitus, sed postquam precibus etiam iracundiam
miscui: "Tuus, inquit, ist frater seu comes paulo ante in conductum
accucurrit, coepitque mihi velle pudorem extorquere. Cum ego proclamarem,
gladium strinxit et 'Si Lucretia es, inquit, Tarquinium
invenisti'".

Quibus ego auditis intentavi in oculos Ascylti manus et:
"Quid dicis, inquam, muliebris patientiae scortum, cuius ne spiritus
purus est?"  Inhorrescere se finxit Ascyltos, mox sublatis fortius
manibus longe maiore nisu clamavit: "Non taces, inquit, gladiator
obscene, quem de ruina harena dimisit?  Non taces, nocturne percussor,
qui ne tum quidem, cum fortiter faceres, cum pura muliere pugnasti, cuius
eadem ratione in viridario frater fui, qua nunc in deversorio puer
est.

--Subduxisti te, inquam, a praeceptoris colloquio.


As if through a fog I saw Giton standing on the sidewalk and ran to him.  
When I asked if it was possible that my brother had prepared lunch for us,
the boy sat down on the bed and wiped his flowing tears with his thumb.
I was upset by my lover's state, and asked him what had happened.
And he, indeed, was slow and reluctant, but after I stirred up his 
passion with pleadings, he said, "Hush, a little while ago 
your lover or companion rushed into our rented room, and 
was minded to wrest my modesty from me.  When I cried out
he drew his sword and said, 'If you are a Lucretia, you have
found your Tarquin.'

When I heard this I shook my fist in Ascyltos' face and said:
"What do you say, you harlot of effeminate submissiveness,
whose soul is defiled?"  Ascyltos counterfeited a shudder, and soon,
after a mightly long struggle with my more powerful upraised fists,
shouted: "Shut it, you perverted gladiator, whom the
arena dismissed with a fall.  Shut up, you nocturnal
assassin, who, even when you did bravely, didn't contend
with an honest woman, whose lover I was in the orchard 
in the same way the now the boy is in the inn."

"Did you," says I, "haul yourself off from the teacher's discussion?"
