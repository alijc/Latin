[X]

Quid ego, homo stultissime, facere debui, cum fame morerer? An videlicet
audirem sententias, id est vitrea fracta et somniorum interpretamenta? Multo
me turpior es tu hercule, qui ut foris cenares, poetam laudasti". Itaque ex
turpissima lite in risum diffusi pacatius ad reliqua secessimus. <. . .>

Rursus in memoriam revocatus iniuriae: "Ascylte, inquam, intellego nobis
convenire non posse. Itaque communes sarcinulas partiamur ac paupertatem nostram
privatis quaestibus temptemus expellere. Et tu litteras scis et ego. Ne
quaestibus tuis obstem, aliud aliquid promittam; alioqui mille causae quotidie
nos collident et per totam urbem rumoribus different."

Non recusavit Ascyltos et: "Hodie, inquit, quia tanquam scholastici ad cenam
promisimus, non perdamus noctem. Cras autem, quia hoc libet, et habitationem
mihi prospiciam et aliquem fratrem.--Tardum est, inquam, differre quod placet."
Hanc tam praecipitem divisionem libido faciebat; iam dudum enim amoliri cupiebam
custodem molestum, ut veterem cum Gitone meo rationem reducerem. <. . .>


What should I have done, idiot, when I was dying of hunger.
Or, evidently, I was listening to opinions that were all broken glass
and the interpretations of dreams?  By Hercules, you are the worse one,
praising a poet so that you can eat out.  And so from this nasty 
quarrel we cheered up in laughter and withdrew to what remained more calmly.

But after I recalled some insults, I said: "Ascyltos, I realize that we can't
travel together (have sex?).  And so let us divvy up our communal belongings
and try to drive our poverty with personal profits.  
Both of us know our letters.
I would not oppose your profit, I promise something else: 
otherwise a thousand reasons will daily crush us and gossip will 
spread though the whole world.

Ascyltos didn't object, and said: "Today, because we promised, as scholars,
to go to dinner, let us not waste the evening.  But tomorrow, because 
it pleases you, I will look for another lodging for myself .. and another
lover."  "It's late", says I, "to put off what you please".
A wantonness created this headlong division; for I was already wishing
to remove the troublesome spy, so I could restore my former account 
with my Giton.
