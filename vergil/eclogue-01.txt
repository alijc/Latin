1.1                        Meliboeus&

Tityre, tu patulae recubans sub tegmine fagi&
silvestrem tenui Musam meditaris avena;&
nos patriae fines et dulcia linquimus arva.&
nos patriam fugimus; tu, Tityre, lentus in umbra&
formosam resonare doces Amaryllida silvas. &              5

                          Tityrus&

O Meliboee, deus nobis haec otia fecit.&
namque erit ille mihi semper deus, illius aram&
saepe tener nostris ab ovilibus imbuet agnus.&
ille meas errare boves, ut cernis, et ipsum&
ludere quae vellem calamo permisit agresti.  &             10

                          Meliboeus&

Non equidem invideo, miror magis; undique totis&
usque adeo turbatur agris. en ipse capellas&
protenus aeger ago; hanc etiam vix, Tityre, duco.&
hic inter densas corylos modo namque gemellos,&
spem gregis, a, silice in nuda conixa reliquit.&               15
saepe malum hoc nobis, si mens non laeva fuisset,&
de caelo tactas memini praedicere quercus.&
sed tamen iste deus qui sit da, Tityre,nobis.


Meliboeus

Tityrus, lying under the cover of a wide-spreading beech,
you are considered a woodland Muse with a delicate shepherd's pipe;
we forsake our ancestral land and pleasant fields.
We fled our native land; you, Tityrus, lazing in the shade,
teach the woods to resound with "Fair Amaryllis".

Tityrus

O Meliboeus, a god created this leisure for us.
Indeed he'll always be a god to me, 
oft will a tender lamb from our sheepfolds anoint his altar.
He allowed my cows to wander, as you know, and lets
me play what I myself would wish upon the rustic reed.

Meliboeus

Truly, I'm not jealous, I'm more amazed; from every side
to such a point there's trouble in all the fields. Look, I myself,
an invalid, drive my goats; yet I can barely lead this one, Tityrus.
Here among the thick hazels she just now abandoned twins,
the hope of the herd, ah, birthed out onto bare flint.
I often bore in mind, had my mind not been on the left,
that the lightning-struck oaks warn us of this evil.
And yet, Tityrus, tell us who that god of yours might be.
