1.1                        Meliboeus&

Tityre, tu patulae recubans sub tegmine fagi&
silvestrem tenui Musam meditaris avena;&
nos patriae fines et dulcia linquimus arva.&
nos patriam fugimus; tu, Tityre, lentus in umbra&
formosam resonare doces Amaryllida silvas. &        5

                          Tityrus&

O Meliboee, deus nobis haec otia fecit.&
namque erit ille mihi semper deus, illius aram&
saepe tener nostris ab ovilibus imbuet agnus.&
ille meas errare boves, ut cernis, et ipsum&
ludere quae vellem calamo permisit agresti.  &     10

                          Meliboeus&

Non equidem invideo, miror magis; undique totis&
usque adeo turbatur agris. en ipse capellas&
protenus aeger ago; hanc etiam vix, Tityre, duco.&
hic inter densas corylos modo namque gemellos,&
spem gregis, a, silice in nuda conixa reliquit.&   15
saepe malum hoc nobis, si mens non laeva fuisset,&
de caelo tactas memini praedicere quercus.&
sed tamen iste deus qui sit da, Tityre,nobis.


Meliboeus

Tityrus, lying under the cover of a wide-spreading beech,
you are considered a woodland Muse with a delicate shepherd's pipe;
we forsake our ancestral land and pleasant fields.
We fled our native land; you, Tityrus, lazing in the shade,
teach the woods to resound with "Fair Amaryllis".

Tityrus

O Meliboeus, a god created this leisure for us.
Indeed he'll always be a god to me, 
oft will a tender lamb from our sheepfolds anoint his altar.
He allowed my cows to wander, as you know, and lets
me play what I myself would wish upon the rustic reed.

Meliboeus

Truly, I'm not jealous, I'm more amazed; from every side
to such a point there's trouble in all the fields. Look, I myself,
an invalid, drive my goats; yet I can barely lead this one, Tityrus.
Here among the thick hazels she just now abandoned twins,
the hope of the herd, ah, birthed out onto bare flint.
I often bore in mind, had my mind not been on the left,
that the lightning-struck oaks warn us of this evil.
And yet, Tityrus, tell us who that god of yours might be.



1.1                          Tityrus&

Urbem quam dicunt Romam, Meliboee, putavi&
stultus ego huic nostrae similem, cui saepe solemus &              20
pastores ovium teneros depellere fetus.&
sic canibus catulos similes, sic matribus haedos&
noram, sic parvis componere magna solebam.&
verum haec tantum alias inter caput extulit urbes&
quantum lenta solent inter viburna cupressi.  &             25

                          Meliboeus&

Et quae tanta fuit Romam tibi causa videndi?&

                          Tityrus

Libertas, quae sera tamen respexit inertem,&
candidior postquam tondenti barba cadebat,&
respexit tamen et longo post tempore venit,&
postquam nos Amaryllis habet, Galatea reliquit. &              30
namque - fatebor enim - dum me Galatea tenebat,&
nec spes libertatis erat nec cura peculi.&
quamvis multa meis exiret victima saeptis&
pinguis et ingratae premeretur caseus urbi,&
non umquam gravis aere domum mihi dextra redibat.               35


Tityrus

Meliboeus, I foolishly believed that the city that they call Rome, 
to this of our() >like, to whom often we are wont
drove out the tender young shepherds of sheep.
I knew that puppies are thus similar to to dogs, kids thus to their dams,
so I used to compare the great to the small.
In truth these things as much >other cities within head he carried out
as bent they used between viburnums of cypress.

Meliboeus

And what such reason was for seeing Rome to you?

Tityrus

Liberty, which too late nonetheless looked back at the helpless,
more radiant after to/by clipping beard it fell,
it looked back and after a long time it came,
after Amaryllis held us, Galatea left us behind.
Indeed - for I will confess - while Galatea was holding me,
neither hope to/by liberty was nor care of private property.
Although a great sacrificial victim might die to/by/in my paddocks
rich cheese might be pressed and by an ungrateful city,
not ever grave house by air on the right he returned.
