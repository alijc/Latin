1.1                        Meliboeus&

Tityre, tu patulae recubans sub tegmine fagi&
silvestrem tenui Musam meditaris avena;&
nos patriae fines et dulcia linquimus arva.&
nos patriam fugimus; tu, Tityre, lentus in umbra&
formosam resonare doces Amaryllida silvas. &        5

                          Tityrus&

O Meliboee, deus nobis haec otia fecit.&
namque erit ille mihi semper deus, illius aram&
saepe tener nostris ab ovilibus imbuet agnus.&
ille meas errare boves, ut cernis, et ipsum&
ludere quae vellem calamo permisit agresti.  &     10

                          Meliboeus&

Non equidem invideo, miror magis; undique totis&
usque adeo turbatur agris. en ipse capellas&
protenus aeger ago; hanc etiam vix, Tityre, duco.&
hic inter densas corylos modo namque gemellos,&
spem gregis, a, silice in nuda conixa reliquit.&   15
saepe malum hoc nobis, si mens non laeva fuisset,&
de caelo tactas memini praedicere quercus.&
sed tamen iste deus qui sit da, Tityre,nobis.
========================================

Meliboeus

Tityrus, lying under the cover of a wide-spreading beech,
you are considered a woodland Muse with a delicate shepherd's pipe;
we forsake our ancestral land and pleasant fields.
We fled our native land; you, Tityrus, lazing in the shade,
teach the woods to resound with "Fair Amaryllis".

Tityrus

O Meliboeus, a god created this leisure for us.
Indeed he'll always be a god to me, 
oft will a tender lamb from our sheepfolds anoint his altar.
He allowed my cows to wander, as you know, and lets
me play what I myself would wish upon the rustic reed.

Meliboeus

Truly, I'm not jealous, I'm more amazed; from every side
to such a point there's trouble in all the fields. Look, I myself,
an invalid, drive my goats; yet I can barely lead this one, Tityrus.
Here among the thick hazels she just now abandoned twins,
the hope of the herd, ah, birthed out onto bare flint.
I often bore in mind, had my mind not been on the left,
that the lightning-struck oaks warn us of this evil.
And yet, Tityrus, tell us who that god of yours might be.
========================================

1.1                          Tityrus&

Urbem quam dicunt Romam, Meliboee, putavi&
stultus ego huic nostrae similem, cui saepe solemus &              20
pastores ovium teneros depellere fetus.&
sic canibus catulos similes, sic matribus haedos&
noram, sic parvis componere magna solebam.&
verum haec tantum alias inter caput extulit urbes&
quantum lenta solent inter viburna cupressi.  &             25

                          Meliboeus&

Et quae tanta fuit Romam tibi causa videndi?&

                          Tityrus

Libertas, quae sera tamen respexit inertem,&
candidior postquam tondenti barba cadebat,&
respexit tamen et longo post tempore venit,&
postquam nos Amaryllis habet, Galatea reliquit. &              30
namque - fatebor enim - dum me Galatea tenebat,&
nec spes libertatis erat nec cura peculi.&
quamvis multa meis exiret victima saeptis&
pinguis et ingratae premeretur caseus urbi,&
non umquam gravis aere domum mihi dextra redibat.               35
========================================

Tityrus:

Meliboeus, I foolishly believed that the city they call Rome
was like ours here, to which we shepherds are often wont
to drive our tender lambs.
I knew that puppies were like dogs, kids like their dams,
I used to compare great things to small like this.
But she has raised her head as high among other cities
as cypresses are wont among the pliant viburnums.

Meliboeus:

And what was the big reason that you had to see Rome?

Tityrus:

Liberty, which, though late, still gazed at a lazy man,
with my beard shining whiter after it fell from the clipping,
she gazed and after a long time she came,
after Amaryllis held me, and Galatea left me.
Indeed - for I will confess - I had no hope for liberty
or care for property while Galatea held me.
However many sacrificial victims left my paddocks
or rich cheeses were pressed for an ungrateful city,
my right hand never returned home heavy with coins.
========================================

1.1                          Meliboeus&

Mirabar quid maesta deos, Amarylli, vocares,&
cui pendere sua patereris in arbore poma.&
Tityrus hinc aberat. ipsae te, Tityre, pinus,&
ipsi te fontes, ipsa haec arbusta vocabant.&

                          Tityrus&

Quid facerem? neque servitio me exire licebat  &             40
nec tam praesentis alibi cognoscere divos.&
hic illum vidi iuvenem, Meliboee, quot annis&
bis senos cui nostra dies altaria fumant,&
hic mihi responsum primus dedit ille petenti:&
'pascite ut ante boves, pueri, submittite tauros.' &              45

                          Meliboeus&

Fortunate senex, ergo tua rura manebunt&
et tibi magna satis, quamvis lapis omnia nudus&
limosoque palus obducat pascua iunco.&
non insueta gravis temptabunt pabula fetas&
nec mala vicini pecoris contagia laedent. &              50
fortunate senex, hic inter flumina nota&
et fontis sacros frigus captabis opacum;&
hinc tibi, quae semper, vicino ab limite saepes&
Hyblaeis apibus florem depasta salicti&
saepe levi somnum suadebit inire susurro;  &            55
hinc alta sub rupe canet frondator ad auras,&
nec tamen interea raucae, tua cura, palumbes&
nec gemere aeria cessabit turtur ab ulmo.
========================================

Meliboeus:

I marvel that you should summon the gods through mournful Amaryllis,
whom you might allow to hang your own fruit in a tree.
Tityrus was away from here, The very pines, the very springs you,
these very orchards summon you, Tityrus.

Tityrus:

What was I to do?  I was not allowed to either get out of servitude
or much of present circumstances elsewhere to recognize the gods.
Meliboeus, I saw that youth here during so many years
our altars smoke for twice six days apeice,
here he first gave me answer as I asked:
"Feed the cows as before, boys, allow the bulls to grow long."

Meliboeus:

Happy old man, therefore your farms will all remain
and to you large enough, however much naked rock
and the marsh covers the pastureland with swamp rush.
Not unaccustomed fodder will test the pregnant beasts
not will evil contagions of the neighbor's herd strike.
Happy old man, here among the well-known rivers
and sacred strings you will long for shaded frost;
from here to you, which always, from the neighbor's boundary fence
Hyblaeis having grazed the blossom with bees in the willows
will often persuade to enter sleep with a gentle whisper;
Henceforth, under the high cliff, the pruner will sing to the breezes,
and not yet meanwhile, (by) your concern, the raucus pigeons
and not airborne the turtle-dove will stop lamenting from the elm tree.
