                        Meliboeus&

Tityre, tu patulae recubans sub tegmine fagi&
silvestrem tenui Musam meditaris avena;&
nos patriae fines et dulcia linquimus arva.&
nos patriam fugimus; tu, Tityre, lentus in umbra&
formosam resonare doces Amaryllida silvas. &        5

                          Tityrus&

O Meliboee, deus nobis haec otia fecit.&
namque erit ille mihi semper deus, illius aram&
saepe tener nostris ab ovilibus imbuet agnus.&
ille meas errare boves, ut cernis, et ipsum&
ludere quae vellem calamo permisit agresti.  &     10

                          Meliboeus&

Non equidem invideo, miror magis; undique totis&
usque adeo turbatur agris. en ipse capellas&
protenus aeger ago; hanc etiam vix, Tityre, duco.&
hic inter densas corylos modo namque gemellos,&
spem gregis, a, silice in nuda conixa reliquit.&   15
saepe malum hoc nobis, si mens non laeva fuisset,&
de caelo tactas memini praedicere quercus.&
sed tamen iste deus qui sit da, Tityre,nobis.
========================================

Meliboeus

Tityrus, lying under the cover of a wide-spreading beech,
you are considered a woodland Muse with a delicate shepherd's pipe;
we forsake our ancestral land and pleasant fields.
We fled our native land; you, Tityrus, lazing in the shade,
teach the woods to resound with "Fair Amaryllis".

Tityrus

O Meliboeus, a god created this leisure for us.
Indeed he'll always be a god to me, 
oft will a tender lamb from our sheepfolds anoint his altar.
He allowed my cows to wander, as you know, and lets
me play what I myself would wish upon the rustic reed.

Meliboeus

Truly, I'm not jealous, I'm more amazed; from every side
to such a point there's trouble in all the fields. Look, I myself,
an invalid, drive my goats; yet I can barely lead this one, Tityrus.
Here among the thick hazels she just now abandoned twins,
the hope of the herd, ah, birthed out onto bare flint.
I often bore in mind, had my mind not been on the left,
that the lightning-struck oaks warn us of this evil.
And yet, Tityrus, tell us who that god of yours might be.
========================================

                          Tityrus&

Urbem quam dicunt Romam, Meliboee, putavi&
stultus ego huic nostrae similem, cui saepe solemus &              20
pastores ovium teneros depellere fetus.&
sic canibus catulos similes, sic matribus haedos&
noram, sic parvis componere magna solebam.&
verum haec tantum alias inter caput extulit urbes&
quantum lenta solent inter viburna cupressi.  &             25

                          Meliboeus&

Et quae tanta fuit Romam tibi causa videndi?&

                          Tityrus

Libertas, quae sera tamen respexit inertem,&
candidior postquam tondenti barba cadebat,&
respexit tamen et longo post tempore venit,&
postquam nos Amaryllis habet, Galatea reliquit. &              30
namque - fatebor enim - dum me Galatea tenebat,&
nec spes libertatis erat nec cura peculi.&
quamvis multa meis exiret victima saeptis&
pinguis et ingratae premeretur caseus urbi,&
non umquam gravis aere domum mihi dextra redibat.               35
========================================

Tityrus:

Meliboeus, I foolishly believed that the city they call Rome
was like ours here, to which we shepherds are often wont
to drive our tender lambs.
I knew that puppies were like dogs, kids like their dams,
I used to compare great things to small like this.
But she has raised her head as high among other cities
as cypresses are wont among the pliant viburnums.

Meliboeus:

And what was the big reason that you had to see Rome?

Tityrus:

Liberty, which, though late, still gazed at a lazy man,
with my beard shining whiter after it fell from the clipping,
she gazed and after a long time she came,
after Amaryllis held me, and Galatea left me.
Indeed - for I will confess - I had no hope for liberty
or care for property while Galatea held me.
However many sacrificial victims left my paddocks
or rich cheeses were pressed for an ungrateful city,
my right hand never returned home heavy with coins.
========================================

1.1                          Meliboeus&

Mirabar quid maesta deos, Amarylli, vocares,&
cui pendere sua patereris in arbore poma.&
Tityrus hinc aberat. ipsae te, Tityre, pinus,&
ipsi te fontes, ipsa haec arbusta vocabant.&

                          Tityrus&

Quid facerem? neque servitio me exire licebat  &             40
nec tam praesentis alibi cognoscere divos.&
hic illum vidi iuvenem, Meliboee, quot annis&
bis senos cui nostra dies altaria fumant,&
hic mihi responsum primus dedit ille petenti:&
'pascite ut ante boves, pueri, submittite tauros.' &              45

                          Meliboeus&

Fortunate senex, ergo tua rura manebunt&
et tibi magna satis, quamvis lapis omnia nudus&
limosoque palus obducat pascua iunco.&
non insueta gravis temptabunt pabula fetas&
nec mala vicini pecoris contagia laedent. &              50
fortunate senex, hic inter flumina nota&
et fontis sacros frigus captabis opacum;&
hinc tibi, quae semper, vicino ab limite saepes&
Hyblaeis apibus florem depasta salicti&
saepe levi somnum suadebit inire susurro;  &            55
hinc alta sub rupe canet frondator ad auras,&
nec tamen interea raucae, tua cura, palumbes&
nec gemere aeria cessabit turtur ab ulmo.
========================================

Meliboeus:

I marveled, mournful Amaryllis, that you should call on the gods,
for whom you let your fruit hang in the tree.
Tityrus was gone from here. And as for you, Tityrus, the very pines,
the very springs, these very orchards were calling for you.

Tityrus:

What was I to do?  I couldn't escape my servitude
nor for a long time come to know propitious gods anywhere else.
Twice a year, Meliboeus, I saw that young man here
for whom our altars smoke for six days,
here he first gave me answer when I asked:
"Feed the cows as before, boy, and rear the bulls."

Meliboeus:

Fortunate old man, and so your lands will remain your own
and great enough for you, however much bare stone
and marsh with slimy rushes cover all your pastureland.
No odd pasturage will afflict the pregnant beasts
nor will evil contagions of the neighbor's herd do damage.
Fortunate old man, here among the well-known rivers
and sacred springs you'll lay hold of shady coolness.
And here, as always, the hedge of willow at the boundary line,
its blossoms grazed by Hybla's bees
will often persuade you to fall asleep with a gentle buzzing.
Here, under the high cliff, the pruner will sing to the breezes,
and meanwhile nonetheless, by your industry, neither the hoarse airborne pigeons
nor the turtle-dove will stop lamenting from the elm tree.
========================================

Tityrus&

Ante leves ergo pascentur in aethere cervi&
et freta destituent nudos in litore pisces,  &             60
ante pererratis amborum finibus exsul&
aut Ararim Parthus bibet aut Germania Tigrim,&
quam nostro illius labatur pectore vultus.&

                          Meliboeus&

At nos hinc alii sitientis ibimus Afros,&
pars Scythiam et rapidum cretae veniemus Oaxen &              65
et penitus toto divisos orbe Britannos.&
en umquam patrios longo post tempore finis&
pauperis et tuguri congestum caespite culmen,&
post aliquot, mea regna, videns mirabor aristas?&
impius haec tam culta novalia miles habebit,  &             70
barbarus has segetes. en quo discordia civis&
produxit miseros; his nos consevimus agros!&
insere nunc, Meliboee, piros, pone ordine vites.&
ite meae, felix quondam pecus, ite capellae.&
non ego vos posthac viridi proiectus in antro    &           75
dumosa pendere procul de rupe videbo;&
carmina nulla canam; non me pascente, capellae,&
florentem cytisum et salices carpetis amaras.
========================================

Tityrus&

And so before the nimble deer are fed in heaven
and the seas leave fish stranded, helpless, on the shore,
before an exile having wandered the lands of both 
either Parthus will drink the Araris or Germania the Tigris,
than would that man's face slip from my heart.&

Meliboeus&

But some of us will go hence to the thirsty Africans,
and some to Scythia to the rushing Oaxes of Crete 
and deep among the Britons, cut off from the whole world.
Look! Seeing long afterwards our fathers' lands,
and, a bit later, the roof of a poor man's cottage, built of turf,
will I ever marvel at my estates, at ears of grain?
A wicked soldier will long hold these freshly plowed fields,
a barbarian these crops.  Look, how the discord of a citizen
led wretches forward; for these we sowed the fields!
Now, Meliboeus, plant pear-trees, set vines in a row.
Go, my goats, my once happy herd, go.
Cast out, I'll see you no more, dangling in a green hollow,
from a far off thorn-choked cliff;
no songs I'll sing; without me feeding you, goats,
it's blooming broom and bitter willows you will browse.
