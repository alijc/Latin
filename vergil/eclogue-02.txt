2.1 Ecloga Secunda&

Formosum pastor Corydon ardebat Alexin,&
delicias domini, nec quid speraret habebat.&
tantum inter densas, umbrosa cacumina, fagos&
adsidue veniebat. ibi haec incondita solus&
montibus et silvis studio iactabat inani;    &           5

'O crudelis Alexi, nihil mea carmina curas?&
nil nostri miserere? mori me denique cogis?&
nunc etiam pecudes umbras et frigora captant,&
nunc virides etiam occultant spineta lacertos,&
Thestylis et rapido fessis messoribus aestu    &           10
alia serpyllumque herbas contundit olentis.&
at mecum raucis, tua dum vestigia lustro,&
sole sub ardenti resonant arbusta cicadis.


Eclogue II

The handsome shepherd Corydon burns for Alexis,
he held his master's pets and not what he hoped for.
He came so much, so often, among the thickets, the shady peaks,
the beech trees. He only scattered these uncivilized things there
in the mountains and forests with an empty zeal;

'O, hardhearted Alexis, do you care nothing for my songs?
Show me no pity? Do you compel me to die?
Already now the sheep long for shadows and cold weather,
already now the green thornfields hide the upper arms,
and Thestylis, in a swift passion, for the weary reapers
crushes the garlic and wild thyme and fragrant herbs.
But with me, while your steps lead to the brothel,
the orchards resound with raucous cicadas under the burning sun.
