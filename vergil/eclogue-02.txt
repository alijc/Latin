2.1 Ecloga Secunda&

Formosum pastor Corydon ardebat Alexin,&
delicias domini, nec quid speraret habebat.&
tantum inter densas, umbrosa cacumina, fagos&
adsidue veniebat. ibi haec incondita solus&
montibus et silvis studio iactabat inani;    &           5

'O crudelis Alexi, nihil mea carmina curas?&
nil nostri miserere? mori me denique cogis?&
nunc etiam pecudes umbras et frigora captant,&
nunc virides etiam occultant spineta lacertos,&
Thestylis et rapido fessis messoribus aestu    &           10
alia serpyllumque herbas contundit olentis.&
at mecum raucis, tua dum vestigia lustro,&
sole sub ardenti resonant arbusta cicadis.


Eclogue II&

The shepherd Corydon burned for fair Alexis,
the delight of his master, he didn't have what he hoped for.
He came so much, so often, among the thick-set beech-trees,
with their shady tree-tops.  There, alone, he scattered
these artless songs in the hills and forests with an empty zeal;&

'O, hardhearted Alexis, care you nothing for my songs?
Do you show me no pity? Compel me to die?
Even now the cattle long for shadows and coolness,
even now the green thorn hedges conceal lizards,
and Thestylis, in a swift passion, for the weary reapers
crushes the garlic and thyme and fragrant herbs.
But with me, while I track your footsteps,
the orchards resound with raucous cicadas under the burning sun.
