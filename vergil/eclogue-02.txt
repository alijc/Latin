2.1 Ecloga Secunda&

Formosum pastor Corydon ardebat Alexin,&
delicias domini, nec quid speraret habebat.&
tantum inter densas, umbrosa cacumina, fagos&
adsidue veniebat. ibi haec incondita solus&
montibus et silvis studio iactabat inani;    &           5

'O crudelis Alexi, nihil mea carmina curas?&
nil nostri miserere? mori me denique cogis?&
nunc etiam pecudes umbras et frigora captant,&
nunc virides etiam occultant spineta lacertos,&
Thestylis et rapido fessis messoribus aestu    &           10
alia serpyllumque herbas contundit olentis.&
at mecum raucis, tua dum vestigia lustro,&
sole sub ardenti resonant arbusta cicadis.

Eclogue II&

The shepherd Corydon burned for fair Alexis,
the delight of his master, he didn't have what he hoped for.
He came so much, so often, among the thick-set beech-trees,
with their shady tree-tops.  There, alone, he scattered
these artless songs in the hills and forests with an empty zeal;

'O, hardhearted Alexis, care you nothing for my songs?
Do you show me no pity? Compel me to die?
Even now the cattle long for shadows and coolness,
even now the green thorn hedges conceal lizards,
and Thestylis, in a swift passion, for the weary reapers
crushes the garlic and thyme and fragrant herbs.
But with me, while I track your footsteps,
the orchards resound with raucous cicadas under the burning sun.
==============================================================


nonne fuit satius tristis Amaryllidos iras&
atque superba pati fastidia? nonne Menalcan,  &             15
quamvis ille niger, quamvis tu candidus esses?&
o formose puer, nimium ne crede colori;&
alba ligustra cadunt, vaccinia nigra leguntur.&

Despectus tibi sum nec qui sim quaeris, Alexi,&
quam dives pecoris, nivei quam lactis abundans.  &             20
mille meae Siculis errant in montibus agnae;&
lac mihi non aestate novum, non frigore defit.&
canto quae solitus, si quando armenta vocabat,&
Amphion Dircaeus in Actaeo Aracyntho.&
nec sum adeo informis; nuper me in litore vidi,   &            25
cum placidum ventis staret mare. non ego Daphnin&
iudice te metuam, si numquam fallit imago.
==============================================================


Wasn't it enough to suffer Amaryllis' gloomy wrath
and over-weening pride?  Isn't Menalcas
as dark as you are fair?
O beauteous boy, don't put too much trust in your complexion;
white privet flowers fall, while dark blueberries are gathered up.

You scorn me, Alexis, and you don't ask who I am,
how wealthy in snowy-white flocks, how rich in milk.
My thousand lambs wander in the Sicilian mountains;
I don't lack fresh milk in the summer, nor in the winter either.
I sing, as Amphion used to sing of Dirce,
as he called his cattle home in Attican Aracynthus.
And indeed, I am not deformed; not long ago I saw myself at the shore,
when the calm sea rested under the winds.  I'd not fear Daphnis
with you as my judge, if the mirror never lies.
==============================================================

O tantum libeat mecum tibi sordida rura&
atque humilis habitare casas et figere cervos&
haedorumque gregem viridi compellere hibisco! &              30
mecum una in silvis imitabere Pana canendo.&
Pan primum calamos cera coniungere pluris&
instituit, Pan curat ovis oviumque magistros;&
nec te paeniteat calamo trivisse labellum.&
haec eadem ut sciret, quid non faciebat Amyntas?   &            35
est mihi disparibus septem compacta cicutis&
fistula, Damoetas dono mihi quam dedit olim&
et dixit moriens: 'te nunc habet ista secundum’;&
dixit Damoetas, invidit stultus Amyntas.&
praeterea duo—nec tuta mihi valle reperti—    &           40
capreoli sparsis etiam nunc pellibus albo,&
bina die siccant ovis ubera; quos tibi servo.&
iam pridem a me illos abducere Thestylis orat;&
et faciet, quoniam sordent tibi munera nostra.

==============================================================

Oh, if only it would please you to live with me
in humble cottages on lowly farms, and hunt the deer
and drive a flock of goat kids with a green marsh mallow twig!
Together with me in the woods you'll mimic Pan in music-making.
Pan who first set many reeds, joined with wax;
Pan who cares for both sheep and their masters;
and you'd not regret wearing your lip out on a reed pipe.
What didn't Amyntas do to learn these same things?
I've a shepherd's pipe, made from seven lengths of hemlock stalk,
which Damoetas once gave me as a gift
and said, dying: 'this now has you as an heir';
said Damoetas, while foolish Amyntas was jealous.
Besides, two - found by me in an unprotected hollow -
fawns with hides still spotted with white,
twice a day they drain a sheep's udders; and these I save for you.
For some time now Thestylis has begged to take these from me;
and she will do so, because my services to you are not enough.
