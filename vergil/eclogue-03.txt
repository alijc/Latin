Ecloga III:

                        Menalcas&

Dic mihi, Damoeta, cuium pecus? An Meliboei?&

                         Damoetas&

Non, verum Aegonos; nuper mihi tradidit Aegon.&

                         Menalcas&

Infelix o semper, oves, pecus! ipse Neaeram&
dum fovet ac ne me sibi praeferat illa veretur,&
hic alienus ovis custos bis mulget in hora,  &             5
et sucus pecori et lac subducitur agnis.&

                         Damoetas&

Parcius ista viris tamen obicienda memento.&
novimus et qui te transversa tuentibus hircis&
et quo—sed faciles Nymphae risere—sacello.&

                         Menalcas&

Tum, credo, cum me arbustum videre Miconos   &            10
atque mala vitis incidere falce novellas.&

                         Damoetas&

Aut hic ad veteres fagos cum Daphnidos arcum&
fregisti et calamos, quae tu, perverse Menalca,&
et, cum vidisti puero donata, dolebas&
et, si non aliqua nocuisses, mortuus esses.               15
===================================================================

                        Menalcas&

Tell me, Damoetas, whose flock is this? Maybe Meliboeus'?

                         Damoetas&

No, indeed it's Aegon's; he recently consigned to me. 

                         Menalcas&

Oh always unlucky sheep and flocks! While he courts
Neaera and fears that she prefers me to him,
this strange keeper milks the sheep twice an hour,
and steals strength from the herd and milk from the lambs.

                         Damoetas&

And yet pass over what's thrown up against men.
We know both who did you, with the goats giving you the side-eye,
and - yet the willing Nymphs laughed - by which shrine.

                         Menalcas&

Then, I think, when they saw me carve up Micon's orchard
and tender grape vines with an evil sickle. 

                         Damoetas&

Or here by the old beech trees when you broke
Daphnis' bow and arrows, which you, perverse Menalcas, 
and, when you saw them given to the boy, you grieved 
And, had you not done him harm somehow, you would have died.

===================================================================
			 Menalcas&

Quid domini faciant, audent cum talia fures?&
non ego te vidi Damonos, pessime, caprum&
excipere insidiis multum latrante Lycisca?&
et cum clamarem 'quo nunc se proripit ille?&
Tityre, coge pecus', tu post carecta latebas. &              20

                         Damoetas&

An mihi cantando victus non redderet ille,&
quem mea carminibus meruisset fistula caprum?&
si nescis, meus ille caper fuit; et mihi Damon&
ipse fatebatur sed reddere posse negabat.&

                         Menalcas&

Cantando tu illum? aut umquam tibi fistula cera &              25
iuncta fuit? non tu in triviis, indocte, solebas&
stridenti miserum stipula disperdere carmen?&

                         Damoetas&

Vis ergo inter nos quid possit uterque vicissim&
experiamur? ego hanc vitulam—ne forte recuses,&
bis venit ad mulctram, binos alit ubere fetus—  &             30
depono; tu dic mecum quo pignore certes.
===================================================================

Menalcas&

What might they do to your master, do thieves dare such things?
Didn't I see you Damonos, wretch, recieve a he-goat
to/by treason/ambush much with barking Lycisca?
And when I shout out 'Who is he stealing from?
Tityrus, round up the flock', you hide behind a bed of rushes.

Damoetas&

Might not he, overcome, return to me with my playing songs
upon my shepherd's pipe, hadn't I deserved a goat?
If you don't know, that goat will be mine; and Damon himself
confessed to me, but denied that he could return.

Menalcas&

By playing that?  Was never for you a shepherd's pipe
joined with wax?  Not in the crossroads, you ignoramus, were you wont
to ruin an unfortunate song with a shrill reed?

Damoetas&

you wish therefore between us what it might be able each in turn
we might put to the test?  I >this heifer - lest by chance you refuse,
twice she came/comes to milk pail, two young each she suckles on the udder -
I'll put up; you say with me by which stake you vie.
