Ecloga III:

                        Menalcas&

Dic mihi, Damoeta, cuium pecus? An Meliboei?&

                         Damoetas&

Non, verum Aegonos; nuper mihi tradidit Aegon.&

                         Menalcas&

Infelix o semper, oves, pecus! ipse Neaeram&
dum fovet ac ne me sibi praeferat illa veretur,&
hic alienus ovis custos bis mulget in hora,  &             5
et sucus pecori et lac subducitur agnis.&

                         Damoetas&

Parcius ista viris tamen obicienda memento.&
novimus et qui te transversa tuentibus hircis&
et quo—sed faciles Nymphae risere—sacello.&

                         Menalcas&

Tum, credo, cum me arbustum videre Miconos   &            10
atque mala vitis incidere falce novellas.&

                         Damoetas&

Aut hic ad veteres fagos cum Daphnidos arcum&
fregisti et calamos, quae tu, perverse Menalca,&
et, cum vidisti puero donata, dolebas&
et, si non aliqua nocuisses, mortuus esses.               15
===================================================================

                        Menalcas&

Tell me, Damoetas, whose flock is this? Maybe Meliboeus'?

                         Damoetas&

No, indeed it's Aegon's; he recently consigned to me. 

                         Menalcas&

Oh always unlucky sheep and flocks! While he courts
Neaera and fears that she prefers me to him,
this strange keeper milks the sheep twice an hour,
and steals strength from the herd and milk from the lambs.

                         Damoetas&

And yet pass over what's thrown up against men.
We know both who did you, with the goats giving you the side-eye,
and - yet the willing Nymphs laughed - by which shrine.

                         Menalcas&

Then, I think, when they saw me carve up Micon's orchard
and tender grape vines with an evil sickle. 

                         Damoetas&

Or here by the old beech trees when you broke
Daphnis' bow and arrows, which you, perverse Menalcas, 
and, when you saw them given to the boy, you grieved 
And, had you not done him harm somehow, you would have died.

===================================================================
			 Menalcas&

Quid domini faciant, audent cum talia fures?&
non ego te vidi Damonis, pessime, caprum&
excipere insidiis multum latrante Lycisca?&
et cum clamarem 'quo nunc se proripit ille?&
Tityre, coge pecus', tu post carecta latebas. &              20

                         Damoetas&

An mihi cantando victus non redderet ille,&
quem mea carminibus meruisset fistula caprum?&
si nescis, meus ille caper fuit; et mihi Damon&
ipse fatebatur sed reddere posse negabat.&

                         Menalcas&

Cantando tu illum? aut umquam tibi fistula cera &              25
iuncta fuit? non tu in triviis, indocte, solebas&
stridenti miserum stipula disperdere carmen?&

                         Damoetas&

Vis ergo inter nos quid possit uterque vicissim&
experiamur? ego hanc vitulam—ne forte recuses,&
bis venit ad mulctram, binos alit ubere fetus—  &             30
depono; tu dic mecum quo pignore certes.
===================================================================

Menalcas&

What might masters do, when rogues dare such things?
Didn't I see you, wretch, sneak Damon's goat
away, while his dog barked her head off?
And when I yelled 'Where is he rushing off to?
Tityrus, round up the flock', you hid behind a bed of rushes.

Damoetas&

And shouldn't he have handed it over to me?  Hadn't I earned a goat
after I won the music contest on my panpipe?
You don't understand, that was my goat; and Damon himself
admitted it to me, but refused to hand it over.

Menalcas&

You beat _him_ in music?  And when did you ever have a panpipe
joined with wax?  You ignoramus, didn't you use to hang out
in the crossroads and murder some poor song with a buzzing reed?

Damoetas&

You wanna prove it? Let's take it in turns between us two.
I'll put up this heifer - in case you're thinking of refusing,
she comes to be milked twice a day, and suckles two young besides -
tell me what you'll bet with me.
