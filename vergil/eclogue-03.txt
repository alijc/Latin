Ecloga III:

                        Menalcas&

Dic mihi, Damoeta, cuium pecus? An Meliboei?&

                         Damoetas&

Non, verum Aegonos; nuper mihi tradidit Aegon.&

                         Menalcas&

Infelix o semper, oves, pecus! ipse Neaeram&
dum fovet ac ne me sibi praeferat illa veretur,&
hic alienus ovis custos bis mulget in hora,  &             5
et sucus pecori et lac subducitur agnis.&

                         Damoetas&

Parcius ista viris tamen obicienda memento.&
novimus et qui te transversa tuentibus hircis&
et quo—sed faciles Nymphae risere—sacello.&

                         Menalcas&

Tum, credo, cum me arbustum videre Miconos   &            10
atque mala vitis incidere falce novellas.&

                         Damoetas&

Aut hic ad veteres fagos cum Daphnidos arcum&
fregisti et calamos, quae tu, perverse Menalca,&
et, cum vidisti puero donata, dolebas&
et, si non aliqua nocuisses, mortuus esses.               15
===================================================================

                        Menalcas&

Tell me, Damoetas, whose flock is this? Maybe Meliboeus'?

                         Damoetas&

No, indeed it's Aegon's; he recently consigned to me. 

                         Menalcas&

Oh always unlucky sheep and flocks! While he courts
Neaera and fears that she prefers me to him,
this strange keeper milks the sheep twice an hour,
and steals strength from the herd and milk from the lambs.

                         Damoetas&

And yet pass over what's thrown up against men.
We know both who did you, with the goats giving you the side-eye,
and - yet the willing Nymphs laughed - by which shrine.

                         Menalcas&

Then, I think, when they saw me carve up Micon's orchard
and tender grape vines with an evil sickle. 

                         Damoetas&

Or here by the old beech trees when you broke
Daphnis' bow and arrows, which you, perverse Menalcas, 
and, when you saw them given to the boy, you grieved 
And, had you not done him harm somehow, you would have died.

===================================================================
			 Menalcas&

Quid domini faciant, audent cum talia fures?&
non ego te vidi Damonis, pessime, caprum&
excipere insidiis multum latrante Lycisca?&
et cum clamarem 'quo nunc se proripit ille?&
Tityre, coge pecus', tu post carecta latebas. &              20

                         Damoetas&

An mihi cantando victus non redderet ille,&
quem mea carminibus meruisset fistula caprum?&
si nescis, meus ille caper fuit; et mihi Damon&
ipse fatebatur sed reddere posse negabat.&

                         Menalcas&

Cantando tu illum? aut umquam tibi fistula cera &              25
iuncta fuit? non tu in triviis, indocte, solebas&
stridenti miserum stipula disperdere carmen?&

                         Damoetas&

Vis ergo inter nos quid possit uterque vicissim&
experiamur? ego hanc vitulam—ne forte recuses,&
bis venit ad mulctram, binos alit ubere fetus—  &             30
depono; tu dic mecum quo pignore certes.
===================================================================

Menalcas&

What should masters do, when rogues dare such things?
Didn't I see you, wretch, sneak Damon's goat
away, while his dog barked her head off?
And when I yelled 'Where is he rushing off to?
Tityrus, round up the flock', you hid behind a bed of rushes.

Damoetas&

And shouldn't he have handed it over to me?  Hadn't I earned the goat
after I won the music contest on my panpipe?
You don't understand, that goat was mine; and Damon himself
admitted it to me, but refused to hand it over.

Menalcas&

You beat _him_ in music?  And when did you ever have a panpipe
joined with wax?  You ignoramus, didn't you use to hang out
in the crossroads and murder some poor song with a buzzing reed?

Damoetas&

You wanna prove it? Let's take it in turns between us two.
I'll put up this heifer - in case you're thinking of refusing,
she comes to be milked twice a day, and suckles two young besides -
tell me what you'll bet with me.
===================================================================
                        Menalcas&

De grege non ausim quicquam deponere tecum.&
est mihi namque domi pater, est iniusta noverca,&
bisque die numerant ambo pecus, alter et haedos.&
verum, id quod multo tute ipse fatebere maius,   &            35
insanire libet quoniam tibi, pocula ponam&
fagina, caelatum divini opus Alcimedontos,&
lenta quibus torno facili superaddita vitis&
diffusos hedera vestit pallente corymbos.&
in medio duo signa, Conon et—quis fuit alter,  &             40
descripsit radio totum qui gentibus orbem,&
tempora quae messor, quae curvus arator haberet?&
necdum illis labra admovi, sed condita servo.&

                         Damoetas&

Et nobis idem Alcimedon duo pocula fecit&
et molli circum est ansas amplexus acantho   &            45
Orpheaque in medio posuit silvasque sequentis;&
necdum illis labra admovi, sed condita servo.&
si ad vitulam spectas, nihil est quod pocula laudes.

===================================================================
Menalcas&

No way would I dare to lay down anything from the herd with you.
For really, I have a father at home, and an evil stepmother too,
twice each day they both count the flock, and one the kids.
Truly, because it pleases you to rave,
I'll wager what you yourself will admit as much greater,
a pair of beech-wood cups, works carved by the divine Alcimedon,
upon which a pliant grape vine was added with a ready chisel;
it covers spreading clusters of berries with pale ivy.
In the middle he described two images, Conon and - someone else,
who with a rod marked out the whole world for its peoples,
which seasons the reaper, which the bent-backed plowman should keep?
I haven't yet brought these to my lips, but keep them in store.

Damoetas&

And the same Alcimedon made two cups for me,
with handles twined round with delicate bear's breeches,
and set Orpheus in the middle with forests behind him;
I haven't yet brought these to my lips, but keep them in store.
If you look at my heifer, it's nothing that you'd praise your cups.

===================================================================

Menalcas&

Numquam hodie effugies; veniam quocumque vocaris.&
audiat haec tantum vel qui venit, ecce Palaemon.    &           50
efficiam posthac ne quemquam voce lacessas.&

                         Damoetas&

Quin age, si quid habes; in me mora non erit ulla&
nec quemquam fugio. tantum, vicine Palaemon,&
sensibus haec imis—res est non parva—reponas.&

                         Palaemon&

Dicite, quandoquidem in molli consedimus herba.   &            55
et nunc omnis ager, nunc omnis parturit arbos,&
nunc frondent silvae, nunc formosissimus annus.&
incipe, Damoeta; tu deinde sequere, Menalca.&
alternis dicetis; amant alterna Camenae.&

                         Damoetas&

Ab Iove principium Musae, Iovis omnia plena;  &             60
ille colit terras, illi mea carmina curae.&

                         Menalcas&

Et me Phoebus amat; Phoebo sua semper apud me&
munera sunt, lauri et suave rubens hyacinthus.
========================================

Menalcas:

You'll never escape today; I'll come wherever you say.
Let whoever's coming hear us, oh look, it's Palaemon.
I'll make it so that you won't challenge anyone with your voice after this.

Damoetas:

All right, why not, if you've got anything; I won't hold back,
and I'm not gonna shun anyone.  So, neighbor Palaemon,
please reach deep within yourself - the affair is not trivial.

Palaemon:

Sing then, since we are settled in the soft turf.
And now the whole field, now the whole tree puts forth,
now the forests are in leaf, now the year is fairest.
Begin, Damoetas; you're next, Menalcas.
Sing in turns; the muses love alternation.

Damoetas:

By the founder Jove, Muses, all things are filled with Jove;
He tends the lands, my songs are in his care.

Menalcas:

And Phoebus loves me; Phoebus' gifts are always with me,
laurels and a charmingly red iris.
========================================

                        Damoetas&

Malo me Galatea petit, lasciva puella,&
et fugit ad salices et se cupit ante videri. &              65

                         Menalcas&

At mihi sese offert ultro meus ignis, Amyntas,&
notior ut iam sit canibus non Delia nostris.&

                         Damoetas&

Parta meae Veneri sunt munera; namque notavi&
ipse locum aeriae quo congessere palumbes.&

                         Menalcas&

Quod potui, puero silvestri ex arbore lecta &              70
aurea mala decem misi; cras altera mittam.&

                         Damoetas&

O quotiens et quae nobis Galatea locuta est!&
partem aliquam, venti, divom referatis ad auris.
 
========================================
Damoetas:

Galatea, the lascivious lass, pelts me with an apple
and flees to the willows, but wishes to be found.

Menalcas:

But my flame, Amyntas, freely offers himself to me,
so that not even Delia is better known to my dogs.

Damoetas:

Gifts were acquired for my Venus; for I myself have seen
the place where the high-flying doves built their nest.

Menalcas:

I sent ten golden apples (all that I could) gathered
from a tree to my wild forest boy; tomorrow I'll send more.

Damoetas:

Oh, how often Galatea spoke to me, and the things that she said!
Winds, please carry some part of those to the ears of the gods.
 
========================================
1.1  Menalcas&

Quid prodest quod me ipse animo non spernis, Amynta,&
si, dum tu sectaris apros, ego retia servo?  &             75

                         Damoetas&

Phyllida mitte mihi; meus est natalis, Iolla,&
cum faciam vitula pro frugibus, ipse venito.&

                         Menalcas&

Phyllida amo ante alias; nam me discedere flevit&
et longum 'formose, vale, vale,' inquit, Iolla.&

                         Damoetas&

Triste lupus stabulis, maturis frugibus imbres, &              80
arboribus venti, nobis Amaryllidos irae.&

                         Menalcas&

Dulce satis umor, depulsis arbutus haedis,&
lenta salix feto pecori, mihi solus Amyntas.&

                         Damoetas&

Pollio amat nostram, quamvis est rustica, Musam;&
Pierides, vitulam lectori pascite vestro.               85
========================================

Menalcas:

What's the use that you don't spurn me, Amyntas,
if, while you pursue the boars, I'm left guarding the nets.

Damoetas:

Send Phyllis to me; it's my birthday, Iollas,
but when I offer a calf for the crops, you can come yourself.

Menalcas:

I love Phyllis above the rest; for she wept that I left her
and for a long while said, "Handsome one, farewell, farewell", Iollas.

Damoetas:

Sadly, like a wolf to the folds, a downpour to the ripe crops,
winds to the trees, so are Amaryllis' rages to us.

Menalcas:

Happily, as moisture for the corn, arbutus for the weaned kids,
weeping willow for the breeding flock, for me there's only Amyntas.

Damoetas:

Pollio loves our Muse, although she's a country girl;
daughters of Pierus, feed a calf for your reader.
========================================
Menalcas&

Pollio et ipse facit nova carmina; pascite taurum,&
iam cornu petat et pedibus qui spargat harenam.&

                         Damoetas&

Qui te, Pollio, amat veniat quo te quoque gaudet;&
mella fluant illi, ferat et rubus asper amomum.&

                         Menalcas&

Qui Bavium non odit, amet tua carmina, Mevi,&               90
atque idem iungat vulpes et mulgeat hircos.&

                         Damoetas&

Qui legitis flores et humi nascentia fraga,&
frigidus—o pueri, fugite hinc—latet anguis in herba.&

                         Menalcas&

Parcite, oves, nimium procedere; non bene ripae&
creditur; ipse aries etiam nunc vellera siccat.   &            95

                         Damoetas&

Tityre, pascentis a flumine reice capellas;&
ipse, ubi tempus erit, omnis in fonte lavabo.&

                         Menalcas&

Cogite oves, pueri; si lac praeceperit aestus,&
ut nuper, frustra pressabimus ubera palmis.&

                         Damoetas&

Heu heu, quam pingui macer est mihi taurus in ervo!  &             100
idem amor exitium pecori pecorisque magistro.
========================================
Menalcas

And even Pollio writes new songs: feed the bull,
now may he attack with his horn and scatter sand with his feet.

Damoetas

Let the one who loves you, Pollio, come where he takes joy in you;
let honey-water flow for him, let even the thorny bramble bear balsam.

Menalcas

He who doesn't hate Bavius, let him love your songs, Mevius,
and let the same man harness foxes and milk he-goats.

Damoetas

You who gather flowers and strawberries springing forth on the ground,
run away, my lads - a cold-blooded snake lurks in the grass.

Menalcas

Forbear, sheep, from advancing too far; the stream bank is not
to be trusted; the ram himself even now dries his fleece.

Damoetas

Tityrus, drive back the goats that are feeding by the river;
when the time comes, I'll wash them all in the pool myself.

Menalcas

Gather the sheep, lads; if the heat dries up their milk,
as happened not long back, we'll squeeze their udders with our palms in vain.

Damoetas

Alas! How scrawny is my bull among the lush vetch!
The same love is destruction to the herd and to its leader.

========================================

                        Menalcas&

His certe—neque amor causa est—vix ossibus haerent;&
nescio quis teneros oculus mihi fascinat agnos.&

                         Damoetas&

Dic quibus in terris—et eris mihi magnus Apollo—&
tris pateat caeli spatium non amplius ulnas.      &         105

                         Menalcas&

Dic quibus in terris inscripti nomina regum&
nascantur flores, et Phyllida solus habeto.&

                         Palaemon&

Non nostrum inter vos tantas componere lites:&
et vitula tu dignus et hic et quisquis amores&
aut metuet dulcis aut experietur amaros.  &             110
claudite iam rivos, pueri; sat prata biberunt.
========================================
Menalcas:

to/by these surely - and love isn't the reason - they barely stick to bones;
I don't know whose evil eye is bewitching my tender lambs.

Damoetas:

And tell them on the lands - and you'll be great Apollo to me -
let the length of the sky extend no more than three arm-lengths.

Menalcas:

And tell them in the lands the names of kings of inscripted man/thing
let the flowers spring up, and you alone shall have Phyllis.

Palaemon&:

It's not for me to judge such quarrels among you:
and calf you deserve both here/this and anyone >loves
or he will dread >sweet loves or will try bitter loves.
shut the streams off now, lads; the meadows have drunk enough.
