Ecloga III:

                        Menalcas&

Dic mihi, Damoeta, cuium pecus? An Meliboei?&

                         Damoetas&

Non, verum Aegonos; nuper mihi tradidit Aegon.&

                         Menalcas&

Infelix o semper, oves, pecus! ipse Neaeram&
dum fovet ac ne me sibi praeferat illa veretur,&
hic alienus ovis custos bis mulget in hora,  &             5
et sucus pecori et lac subducitur agnis.&

                         Damoetas&

Parcius ista viris tamen obicienda memento.&
novimus et qui te transversa tuentibus hircis&
et quo—sed faciles Nymphae risere—sacello.&

                         Menalcas&

Tum, credo, cum me arbustum videre Miconos   &            10
atque mala vitis incidere falce novellas.&

                         Damoetas&

Aut hic ad veteres fagos cum Daphnidos arcum&
fregisti et calamos, quae tu, perverse Menalca,&
et, cum vidisti puero donata, dolebas&
et, si non aliqua nocuisses, mortuus esses.               15
===================================================================

                        Menalcas&

Tell me, Damoetas, whose flock is this? Maybe Meliboeus'?

                         Damoetas&

No, indeed it's Aegon's; he recently consigned to me. 

                         Menalcas&

Oh always unlucky sheep and flocks! While he courts
Neaera and fears that she prefers me to him,
this strange keeper milks the sheep twice an hour,
and steals strength from the herd and milk from the lambs.

                         Damoetas&

And yet pass over what's thrown up against men.
We know both who did you, with the goats giving you the side-eye,
and - yet the willing Nymphs laughed - by which shrine.

                         Menalcas&

Then, I think, when they saw me carve up Micon's orchard
and tender grape vines with an evil sickle. 

                         Damoetas&

Or here by the old beech trees when you broke
Daphnis' bow and arrows, which you, perverse Menalcas, 
and, when you saw them given to the boy, you grieved 
And, had you not done him harm somehow, you would have died.

===================================================================
			 Menalcas&

Quid domini faciant, audent cum talia fures?&
non ego te vidi Damonis, pessime, caprum&
excipere insidiis multum latrante Lycisca?&
et cum clamarem 'quo nunc se proripit ille?&
Tityre, coge pecus', tu post carecta latebas. &              20

                         Damoetas&

An mihi cantando victus non redderet ille,&
quem mea carminibus meruisset fistula caprum?&
si nescis, meus ille caper fuit; et mihi Damon&
ipse fatebatur sed reddere posse negabat.&

                         Menalcas&

Cantando tu illum? aut umquam tibi fistula cera &              25
iuncta fuit? non tu in triviis, indocte, solebas&
stridenti miserum stipula disperdere carmen?&

                         Damoetas&

Vis ergo inter nos quid possit uterque vicissim&
experiamur? ego hanc vitulam—ne forte recuses,&
bis venit ad mulctram, binos alit ubere fetus—  &             30
depono; tu dic mecum quo pignore certes.
===================================================================

Menalcas&

What should masters do, when rogues dare such things?
Didn't I see you, wretch, sneak Damon's goat
away, while his dog barked her head off?
And when I yelled 'Where is he rushing off to?
Tityrus, round up the flock', you hid behind a bed of rushes.

Damoetas&

And shouldn't he have handed it over to me?  Hadn't I earned the goat
after I won the music contest on my panpipe?
You don't understand, that goat was mine; and Damon himself
admitted it to me, but refused to hand it over.

Menalcas&

You beat _him_ in music?  And when did you ever have a panpipe
joined with wax?  You ignoramus, didn't you use to hang out
in the crossroads and murder some poor song with a buzzing reed?

Damoetas&

You wanna prove it? Let's take it in turns between us two.
I'll put up this heifer - in case you're thinking of refusing,
she comes to be milked twice a day, and suckles two young besides -
tell me what you'll bet with me.
===================================================================
                        Menalcas&

De grege non ausim quicquam deponere tecum.&
est mihi namque domi pater, est iniusta noverca,&
bisque die numerant ambo pecus, alter et haedos.&
verum, id quod multo tute ipse fatebere maius,   &            35
insanire libet quoniam tibi, pocula ponam&
fagina, caelatum divini opus Alcimedontos,&
lenta quibus torno facili superaddita vitis&
diffusos hedera vestit pallente corymbos.&
in medio duo signa, Conon et—quis fuit alter,  &             40
descripsit radio totum qui gentibus orbem,&
tempora quae messor, quae curvus arator haberet?&
necdum illis labra admovi, sed condita servo.&

                         Damoetas&

Et nobis idem Alcimedon duo pocula fecit&
et molli circum est ansas amplexus acantho   &            45
Orpheaque in medio posuit silvasque sequentis;&
necdum illis labra admovi, sed condita servo.&
si ad vitulam spectas, nihil est quod pocula laudes.

===================================================================
Menalcas&

No way would I dare to lay down anything from the herd with you.
For really, I have a father at home, and an evil stepmother too,
twice each day they both count the flock, and one the kids.
Truly, because it pleases you to rave,
I'll wager what you yourself will admit as much greater,
a pair of beech-wood cups, works carved by the divine Alcimedon,
upon which a pliant grape vine was added with a ready chisel;
it covers spreading clusters of berries with pale ivy.
In the middle he described two images, Conon and - someone else,
who with a rod marked out the whole world for its peoples,
which seasons the reaper, which the bent-backed plowman should keep?
I haven't yet brought these to my lips, but keep them in store.

Damoetas&

And the same Alcimedon made two cups for me,
with handles twined round with delicate bear's breeches,
and set Orpheus in the middle with forests behind him;
I haven't yet brought these to my lips, but keep them in store.
If you look at my heifer, it's nothing that you'd praise your cups.

===================================================================

Menalcas&

Numquam hodie effugies; veniam quocumque vocaris.&
audiat haec tantum vel qui venit, ecce Palaemon.    &           50
efficiam posthac ne quemquam voce lacessas.&

                         Damoetas&

Quin age, si quid habes; in me mora non erit ulla&
nec quemquam fugio. tantum, vicine Palaemon,&
sensibus haec imis—res est non parva—reponas.&

                         Palaemon&

Dicite, quandoquidem in molli consedimus herba.   &            55
et nunc omnis ager, nunc omnis parturit arbos,&
nunc frondent silvae, nunc formosissimus annus.&
incipe, Damoeta; tu deinde sequere, Menalca.&
alternis dicetis; amant alterna Camenae.&

                         Damoetas&

Ab Iove principium Musae, Iovis omnia plena;  &             60
ille colit terras, illi mea carmina curae.&

                         Menalcas&

Et me Phoebus amat; Phoebo sua semper apud me&
munera sunt, lauri et suave rubens hyacinthus.
========================================

Menalcas:

You'll never escape today; I'll come wherever you say.
Let whoever's coming hear us, oh look, it's Palaemon.
I'll make it so that you won't challenge anyone with your voice after this.

Damoetas:

All right, why not, if you've got anything; I won't hold back,
and I'm not gonna shun anyone.  So, neighbor Palaemon,
please reach deep within yourself - the affair is not trivial.

Palaemon:

Sing then, since we are settled in the soft turf.
And now the whole field, now the whole tree puts forth,
now the forests are in leaf, now the year is fairest.
Begin, Damoetas; you're next, Menalcas.
Sing in turns; the muses love alternation.

Damoetas:

By the founder Jove, Muses, all things are filled with Jove;
He tends the lands, my songs are in his care.

Menalcas:

And Phoebus loves me; Phoebus' gifts are always with me,
laurels and a charmingly red iris.
