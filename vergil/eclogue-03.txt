Ecloga III:

                        Menalcas&

Dic mihi, Damoeta, cuium pecus? An Meliboei?&

                         Damoetas&

Non, verum Aegonos; nuper mihi tradidit Aegon.&

                         Menalcas&

Infelix o semper, oves, pecus! ipse Neaeram&
dum fovet ac ne me sibi praeferat illa veretur,&
hic alienus ovis custos bis mulget in hora,  &             5
et sucus pecori et lac subducitur agnis.&

                         Damoetas&

Parcius ista viris tamen obicienda memento.&
novimus et qui te transversa tuentibus hircis&
et quo—sed faciles Nymphae risere—sacello.&

                         Menalcas&

Tum, credo, cum me arbustum videre Miconos   &            10
atque mala vitis incidere falce novellas.&

                         Damoetas&

Aut hic ad veteres fagos cum Daphnidos arcum&
fregisti et calamos, quae tu, perverse Menalca,&
et, cum vidisti puero donata, dolebas&
et, si non aliqua nocuisses, mortuus esses.               15


                        Menalcas&

Tell me, Damoetas, whose flock is this? Maybe Meliboeus'?

                         Damoetas&

No, indeed it's Aegon's; he recently consigned to me. 

                         Menalcas&

Oh always unlucky sheep and flocks! While he courts
Neaera and she fears that he prefers me to her,
this strange keeper milks the sheep twice an hour,
and steals strength from the herd and milk from the lambs.

                         Damoetas&

And yet pass over what's thrown up against men.
We know both who did you, with the goats giving you the side-eye,
and - yet the willing Nymphs laughed - by which shrine.

                         Menalcas&

Then, I think, when they saw me carve up Micon's orchard
and tender grape vines with an evil sickle. 

                         Damoetas&

Or here by the old beech trees when you broke
Daphnis' bow and arrows, which you, perverse Menalcas, 
and, when you saw them given to the boy, you grieved 
And, had you not done him harm somehow, you would have died.
