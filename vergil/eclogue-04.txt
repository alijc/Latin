Sicelides Musae, paulo maiora canamus.&
non omnis arbusta iuvant humilesque myricae;&
si canimus silvas, silvae sint consule dignae.&

Ultima Cumaei venit iam carminis aetas;&
magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo. &              5
iam redit et Virgo, redeunt Saturnia regna,&
iam nova progenies caelo demittitur alto.&
tu modo nascenti puero, quo ferrea primum&
desinet ac toto surget gens aurea mundo,&
casta fave Lucina; tuus iam regnat Apollo.  &             10

Teque adeo decus hoc aevi, te consule, inibit,&
Pollio, et incipient magni procedere menses;&
te duce, si qua manent sceleris vestigia nostri,&
inrita perpetua solvent formidine terras.


Sicilian Muses, let us sing of things a little greater.
Not every orchard or lowly tamarisk is delightful;
since we celebrate the woods, let them be worthy of a consul.

The last age of Sybil's prophesy has come at last;
a great order of generations springs anew.
Now Virgo returns, with the kingdoms of Saturn,
now a new race is sent down from heaven on high.
You, with only a borning boy, through whom an nation of iron
will end at last, and one of gold rise up throughout the world -
favor him, chaste Lucina; your Apollo now reigns.

And this glory will begin in the year of your consulship,
Pollio, and the great months will commense to advance;
with you as our leader, whatever useless traces are left of our sin,
will free the lands from everlasting dread.

==============================================

ille deum vitam accipiet divisque videbit &              15
permixtos heroas et ipse videbitur illis&
pacatumque reget patriis virtutibus orbem.&

At tibi prima, puer, nullo munuscula cultu&
errantis hederas passim cum baccare tellus&
mixtaque ridenti colocasia fundet acantho. &             20
ipsae lacte domum referent distenta capellae&
ubera nec magnos metuent armenta leones;&
ipsa tibi blandos fundent cunabula flores.&
occidet et serpens et fallax herba veneni&
occidet; Assyrium vulgo nascetur amomum.  &             25

At simul heroum laudes et facta parentis&
iam legere et quae sit poteris cognoscere virtus,&
molli paulatim flavescet campus arista&
incultisque rubens pendebit sentibus uva&
et durae quercus sudabunt roscida mella.               30


he >god >life will take and to/by gods will see
>mixed/confused heroes and himself will seem to those
and he will rule a peaceful orb through his father's virtue.

But to you, boy, to/by no cult the first small favors
of wandering >ivys here and there with foxglove the earth
and mixed colocasia to/by laughing hellebore will found/pour.
the goats themselves home will carry back
udders distended with milk and the flocks will not fear great lions;
a very cradle will pour out charming blossoms to you.
will kill both snake and deceitful grass of poison
will kill; Assyrian to/by common people will be born a balsam-plant.

But at the same time of a demigod praises and acts of parent
already to read and you, virtue, who it might be will be able to recognize,
a bit the plain will turn yellow with soft grain
and to/by uncultivated reddening a grape will hang down to/by thorns
and hard oaks will sweat out dewy honey.
