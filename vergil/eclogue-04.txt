Sicelides Musae, paulo maiora canamus.&
non omnis arbusta iuvant humilesque myricae;&
si canimus silvas, silvae sint consule dignae.&

Ultima Cumaei venit iam carminis aetas;&
magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo. &              5
iam redit et Virgo, redeunt Saturnia regna,&
iam nova progenies caelo demittitur alto.&
tu modo nascenti puero, quo ferrea primum&
desinet ac toto surget gens aurea mundo,&
casta fave Lucina; tuus iam regnat Apollo.  &             10

Teque adeo decus hoc aevi, te consule, inibit,&
Pollio, et incipient magni procedere menses;&
te duce, si qua manent sceleris vestigia nostri,&
inrita perpetua solvent formidine terras.


Sicilian Muses, let us sing of things a little greater.
Not every orchard or lowly tamarisk is delightful;
since we celebrate the woods, let them be worthy of a consul.

The last age of Sybil's prophesy has come at last;
a great order of generations springs anew.
Now Virgo returns, with the kingdoms of Saturn,
now a new race is sent down from heaven on high.
You, with only a borning boy, through whom an nation of iron
will end at last, and one of gold rise up throughout the world -
favor him, chaste Lucina; your Apollo now reigns.

And this glory will begin in the year of your consulship,
Pollio, and the great months will commense to advance;
with you as our leader, whatever useless traces are left of our sin,
will free the lands from everlasting dread.

==============================================

ille deum vitam accipiet divisque videbit &              15
permixtos heroas et ipse videbitur illis&
pacatumque reget patriis virtutibus orbem.&

At tibi prima, puer, nullo munuscula cultu&
errantis hederas passim cum baccare tellus&
mixtaque ridenti colocasia fundet acantho. &             20
ipsae lacte domum referent distenta capellae&
ubera nec magnos metuent armenta leones;&
ipsa tibi blandos fundent cunabula flores.&
occidet et serpens et fallax herba veneni&
occidet; Assyrium vulgo nascetur amomum.  &             25

At simul heroum laudes et facta parentis&
iam legere et quae sit poteris cognoscere virtus,&
molli paulatim flavescet campus arista&
incultisque rubens pendebit sentibus uva&
et durae quercus sudabunt roscida mella.               30


He will take up the life of the gods, and will see heroes
mingling with gods and will himself be seen by them,
and he will rule a peaceful orb through his father's virtue.

But for you, boy, the earth will pour out, without cultivation,
its first small gifts, ivys wandering here and there, with foxglove 
and colocasia and laughing hellebore mixed in.
Of their own accord the goats will bring home their udders,
swollen with milk, and the flocks will not fear great lions;
Your very cradle will pour out blossoms to caress you.
Both the snake and the deceitful toxic herb will perish;
The Assyrian balsam-plant will spring up everywhere.

But presently, you'll be able to read of the renown of heros
and the deeds of your parent, and to recognize what virtue is,
bit by bit the plain will turn yellow with soft ears of grain
and a reddening grape will hang from uncultivated thorns,
and hard oaks will sweat dewy honey.
