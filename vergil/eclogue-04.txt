Sicelides Musae, paulo maiora canamus.&
non omnis arbusta iuvant humilesque myricae;&
si canimus silvas, silvae sint consule dignae.&

Ultima Cumaei venit iam carminis aetas;&
magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo. &              5
iam redit et Virgo, redeunt Saturnia regna,&
iam nova progenies caelo demittitur alto.&
tu modo nascenti puero, quo ferrea primum&
desinet ac toto surget gens aurea mundo,&
casta fave Lucina; tuus iam regnat Apollo.  &             10

Teque adeo decus hoc aevi, te consule, inibit,&
Pollio, et incipient magni procedere menses;&
te duce, si qua manent sceleris vestigia nostri,&
inrita perpetua solvent formidine terras.


Sicilian Muses, let us sing of things a little greater.
Not every orchard or lowly tamarisk is delightful;
since we celebrate the woods, let them be worthy of a consul.

The last age of Sybil's prophesy has come at last;
a great order of generations springs anew.
Now Virgo returns, with the kingdoms of Saturn,
now a new race is sent down from heaven on high.
You, with only a borning boy, through whom an nation of iron
will end at last, and one of gold rise up throughout the world -
favor him, chaste Lucina; your Apollo now reigns.

And this glory will begin in the year of your consulship,
Pollio, and the great months will commense to advance;
with you as our leader, whatever useless traces are left of our sin,
will free the lands from everlasting dread.

==============================================

ille deum vitam accipiet divisque videbit &              15
permixtos heroas et ipse videbitur illis&
pacatumque reget patriis virtutibus orbem.&

At tibi prima, puer, nullo munuscula cultu&
errantis hederas passim cum baccare tellus&
mixtaque ridenti colocasia fundet acantho. &             20
ipsae lacte domum referent distenta capellae&
ubera nec magnos metuent armenta leones;&
ipsa tibi blandos fundent cunabula flores.&
occidet et serpens et fallax herba veneni&
occidet; Assyrium vulgo nascetur amomum.  &             25

At simul heroum laudes et facta parentis&
iam legere et quae sit poteris cognoscere virtus,&
molli paulatim flavescet campus arista&
incultisque rubens pendebit sentibus uva&
et durae quercus sudabunt roscida mella.               30

==============================================

He will take up the life of the gods, and will see heroes
mingling with gods and will himself be seen by them,
and he will rule a peaceful orb through his father's virtue.

But for you, boy, the earth will pour out, without cultivation,
its first small gifts, ivys wandering here and there, with foxglove 
and colocasia and laughing hellebore mixed in.
Of their own accord the goats will bring home their udders,
swollen with milk, and the flocks will not fear great lions;
Your very cradle will pour out blossoms to caress you.
Both the snake and the deceitful toxic herb will perish;
The Assyrian balsam-plant will spring up everywhere.

But presently, you'll be able to read of the renown of heros
and the deeds of your parent, and to recognize what virtue is,
bit by bit the plain will turn yellow with soft ears of grain
and a reddening grape will hang from uncultivated thorns,
and hard oaks will sweat dewy honey.

==============================================

Pauca tamen suberunt priscae vestigia fraudis,&
quae temptare Thetin ratibus, quae cingere muris&
oppida, quae iubeant telluri infindere sulcos.&
alter erit tum Tiphys et altera quae vehat Argo&
delectos heroas; erunt etiam altera bella      &         35
atque iterum ad Troiam magnus mittetur Achilles.&

Hinc, ubi iam firmata virum te fecerit aetas,&
cedet et ipse mari vector nec nautica pinus&
mutabit merces; omnis feret omnia tellus.&
non rastros patietur humus, non vinea falcem,   &            40
robustus quoque iam tauris iuga solvet arator;&
nec varios discet mentiri lana colores,&
ipse sed in pratis aries iam suave rubenti&
murice, iam croceo mutabit vellera luto,&
sponte sua sandyx pascentis vestiet agnos.               45

==============================================

And yet, a few traces of the former deceit will lurk underfoot,
which may entice us to test the Sea with boats,
to ring towns with walls, to plow furrows into the earth.
There will be another Tiphys then, and another Argo may bear
its chosen heros; there will be other wars as well
and Achilles will be sent again to Troy.

After this, when the established age makes you a man,
the trader will retire from the sea, nor will the pinewood ship
move goods; each region will produce everything.
The soil will not endure the plow, nor the vines the sickle,
likewise, the hardy plowman will free the bulls from their yokes;
and wool will learn not to counterfeit hues,
but the ram in meadows will itself grow red with sweet 
Tyrian purple, then will dye its fleeces yellow,
scarlet on its own will cloth the grazing lambs.
==============================================

‘Talia saecla' suis dixerunt 'currite' fusis&
concordes stabili fatorum numine Parcae.&

Adgredere o magnos—aderit iam tempus—honores,&
cara deum suboles, magnum Iovis incrementum.&
aspice convexo nutantem pondere mundum,  &            50
terrasque tractusque maris caelumque profundum;&
aspice, venturo laetantur ut omnia saeclo.&

O mihi tum longae maneat pars ultima vitae,&
spiritus et quantum sat erit tua dicere facta:&
non me carminibus vincat nec Thracius Orpheus  &            55
nec Linus, huic mater quamvis atque huic pater adsit,&
Orphei Calliopea, Lino formosus Apollo.&
Pan etiam, Arcadia mecum si iudice certet,&
Pan etiam Arcadia dicat se iudice victum.

========================================
"O blessed ages," said the Fates to their spindles, "hurry"
agreeing with the steadyfast will of the divine oracles.

Approach, dear twig, Jove's great augmentation,
(the time will soon be here), great honors, god.
Look at the world, shaking under its arched burden,
and the lands and regions of the sea and boundless sky;
look, may a whole generation rejoice at your coming.

O may the last part of my long life abide for ages,
and give me breath enough to tell your deeds:
may neither the Thracian Orpheus nor Linus outdo me in poetry,
however much a mother and a father is here for him,
Orpheus' Calliopea, or Linus' handsome Apollo.
Even Pan, if he would vie with me with Arcadia as judge,
even Pan, with Arcadia as a judge, would own himself as beaten.

==============================================

Incipe, parve puer, risu cognoscere matrem; &              60
matri longa decem tulerunt fastidia menses.&
incipe, parve puer. qui non risere parenti,&
nec deus hunc mensa dea nec dignata cubili est.&
==============================================

Begin, little boy, to recognize your mother with laughter;
ten (lunar, I fervently hope) months have brought her long fastidiousness.
Begin, little boy.  Who not laughed at parent,
and not a god >this(m) a table/measured goddess nor thought worthy to/by bed is.
