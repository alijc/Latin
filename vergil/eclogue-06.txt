Prima Syracosio dignata est ludere uersu
nostra, neque erubuit siluas habitare, Thalia.
Cum canerem reges et proelia, Cynthius aurem
uellit, et admonuit: "Pastorem, Tityre, pinguis
pascere oportet ouis, deductum dicere carmen."               5
Nunc ego (namque super tibi erunt, qui dicere laudes,
Vare, tuas cupiant, et tristia condere bella)
agrestem tenui meditabor harundine musam.
Non iniussa cano. Si quis tamen haec quoque, si quis
captus amore leget, te nostrae, Vare, myricae,               10
te nemus omne canet; nec Phoebo gratior ulla est
quam sibi quae Vari praescripsit pagina nomen.
Pergite, Pierides. Chromis et Mnasylus in antro
Silenum pueri somno uidere iacentem,
inflatum hesterno uenas, ut semper, Iaccho;               15
serta procul tantum capiti delapsa iacebant,
et grauis attrita pendebat cantharus ansa.
Adgressi (nam saepe senex spe carminis ambo
luserat) iniciunt ipsis ex uincula sertis.
Addit se sociam timidisque superuenit Aegle.               20
========================================

First, our Thalia thought it fit to play with Syracusan verse,
nor did she blush to live in the woods.
When I would sing of kings and battles, Apollo plucked my ear
and admonished me: "Tityrus, it is right for the shepherd
to graze fat sheep, but sing a fine-spun song."
Now I (For there will be more than enough of those who wish
to declaim your praises, Varus, and to celebrate sorrowful wars.)
will meditate on the rustic muse with a slender reed.
I do not sing unbidden.  Still, if anyone reads these, anyone
captured by love that is, our tamarisks and every wood, Varus,
will sing of you; and nothing pleases Phoebus more
than the page on which he wrote the name of Varus.
Proceed, Muses.  The boys Chromis and Mnasylus
saw Silenus, lying asleep in a cave,
bloated, as always, by yesterday's wine;
His garlands lay apart, having slipped from his head,
and a heavy mug hung by its worn-out handle.
They fell upon him (For the old man had often played them both with their hopes
for a song.) and threw him into fetters made from his own garlands.
Then Aegle arrives and joins up as an ally for the timid boys.
