Prima Syracosio dignata est ludere uersu
nostra, neque erubuit siluas habitare, Thalia.
Cum canerem reges et proelia, Cynthius aurem
uellit, et admonuit: "Pastorem, Tityre, pinguis
pascere oportet ouis, deductum dicere carmen."               5
Nunc ego (namque super tibi erunt, qui dicere laudes,
Vare, tuas cupiant, et tristia condere bella)
agrestem tenui meditabor harundine musam.
Non iniussa cano. Si quis tamen haec quoque, si quis
captus amore leget, te nostrae, Vare, myricae,               10
te nemus omne canet; nec Phoebo gratior ulla est
quam sibi quae Vari praescripsit pagina nomen.
Pergite, Pierides. Chromis et Mnasylus in antro
Silenum pueri somno uidere iacentem,
inflatum hesterno uenas, ut semper, Iaccho;               15
serta procul tantum capiti delapsa iacebant,
et grauis attrita pendebat cantharus ansa.
Adgressi (nam saepe senex spe carminis ambo
luserat) iniciunt ipsis ex uincula sertis.
Addit se sociam timidisque superuenit Aegle.               20
========================================

First, our Thalia thought it fit to play with Syracusan verse,
nor did she blush to live in the woods.
When I would sing of kings and battles, Apollo plucked my ear
and admonished me: "Tityrus, it is right for the shepherd
to graze fat sheep, but sing a fine-spun song."
Now I (For there will be more than enough of those who wish
to declaim your praises, Varus, and to celebrate sorrowful wars.)
will meditate on the rustic muse with a slender reed.
I do not sing unbidden.  Still, if anyone reads these, anyone
captured by love that is, our tamarisks and every wood, Varus,
will sing of you; and nothing pleases Phoebus more
than the page on which he wrote the name of Varus.
Proceed, Muses.  The boys Chromis and Mnasylus
saw Silenus, lying asleep in a cave,
bloated, as always, by yesterday's wine;
His garlands lay apart, having slipped from his head,
and a heavy mug hung by its worn-out handle.
They fell upon him (For the old man had often played them both with their hopes
for a song.) and threw him into fetters made from his own garlands.
Then Aegle arrives and joins up as an ally for the timid boys.
========================================
Aegle, Naiadum pulcherrima, iamque uidenti
sanguineis frontem moris et tempora pingit.
Ille dolum ridens: "Quo uincula nectitis?" inquit.
"Soluite me, pueri; satis est potuisse uideri.
Carmina quae uoltis cognoscite; carmina uobis,               25
huic aliud mercedis erit." Simul incipit ipse.
Tum uero in numerum Faunosque ferasque uideres
ludere, tum rigidas motare cacumina quercus.
Nec tantum Phoebo gaudet Parnasia rupes,
nec tantum Rhodope miratur et Ismarus Orphea.               30
Namque canebat uti magnum per inane coacta
semina terrarumque animaeque marisque fuissent
et liquidi simul ignis; ut his exordia primis
omnia, et ipse tener mundi concreuerit orbis;
tum durare solum et discludere Nerea ponto               35
coeperit, et rerum paulatim sumere formas;
iamque nouom terrae stupeant lucescere solem,
altius atque cadant submotis nubibus imbres,
incipiant siluae cum primum surgere, cumque
rara per ignaros errent animalia montis.               40
========================================

Aegle, the fairest of the Naiads, now annoints
the seer's brow and temples with blood-red mulberries.
Laughing at this fraud, he says, "Why are you tying the fetters?
Release me, boys; It's enough to have seen what you can do.
The songs that you wish to learn; songs for you,
there'll be a different wage for her." And he begins at once.
Then you might truly see both Fauns and wild beasts dancing
to the rhythm, then the hardy oaks waving their tops.
The Parnasian cliff doesn't rejoice so well in Phoebus,
nor does Ismarus or Rhodope marvel so at Orpheus.
Indeed, he sang of how the collected elements of earth
and air and water existed throughout the great void, 
and of bright fire as well; how the young world itself
spun the warp and weft from these primary elements;
then began to firm up the soil, and break Nereus off
from the sea, and things bit by bit assumed their form;
now, the lands gazed in wonder at the new sun shining,
and the rains fell from clouds pushed higher,
when first the forests began to rise, and scattered
bands of animals wandered across the unknowing mountains.
========================================

Hinc lapides Pyrrhae iactos, Saturnia regna,
Caucasiasque refert uolucris, furtumque Promethei.
His adiungit Hylan nautae quo fonte relictum
clamassent, ut litus Hyla, Hyla, omne sonaret;
et fortunatam, si numquam armenta fuissent,               45
Pasiphaen niuei solatur amore iuuenci.
A! uirgo infelix, quae te dementia cepit!
Proetides implerunt falsis mugitibus agros;
at non tam turpis pecudum tamen ulla secuta
concubitus, quamuis collo timuisset aratrum,               50
et saepe in leui quaesisset cornua fronte.
A! uirgo infelix, tu nunc in montibus erras:
ille, latus niueum molli fultus hyacintho,
ilice sub nigra pallentis ruminat herbas,
aut aliquam in magno sequitur grege. "Claudite Nymphae,               55
Dictaeae Nymphae, nemorum iam claudite saltus,
si qua forte ferant oculis sese obuia nostris
errabunda bouis uestigia: forsitan illum
aut herba captum uiridi aut armenta secutum
perducant aliquae stabula ad Cortynia uaccae."               60
========================================
Then he described the stones that Pyrrha cast, Saturn's realms,
and the Caucasian birds and Prometheus' theft.
To these he added how, after leaving Hylas at a spring, the sailors
had cried out, to make every shore resound with "Hylas, Hylas";
and Pasiphae, who would have been happy, had herds never existed,
is comforted in the love of a snow-white bull.
Ah, unhappy maiden, who seized you with madness!
The daughters of Proetus filled the fields with counterfeit bellows;
and yet not one of them sought such a filthy concubinage with cattle,
however much she might have feared the plow on her neck,
or looked for horns on her smooth brow.
Ah, unhappy maiden, now you wander in the mountains:
while he has laid his snow-white flank on soft hyacynth
and munches pale green grass under a dark holm-oak,
or chases after some cow in the great herd. "Block off, Nymphs,
my Dictaean Nymphs, block off the paths of the forests already,
in hopes that by chance the wandering tracks of the bull should haste
to assail our eyes: perhaps he's been
captivated by fresh grass or is following the herd,
and some cows will lead him to the Cortynian stalls."
========================================

Tum canit Hesperidum miratam mala puellam;&
tum Phaethontiadas musco circundat amarae&
corticis, atque solo proceras erigit alnos.&
Tum canit, errantem Permessi ad flumina Gallum&
Aonas in montis ut duxerit una sororum, &              65
utque uiro Phoebi chorus adsurrexerit omnis;&
ut Linus haec illi diuino carmine pastor,&
floribus atque apio crinis ornatus amaro,&
dixerit: "Hos tibi dant calamos, en accipe, Musae,&
Ascraeo quos ante seni; quibus ille solebat  &             70
cantando rigidas deducere montibus ornos.&
His tibi Grynei nemoris dicatur origo,&
ne quis sit lucus quo se plus iactet Apollo."
========================================
Next he sang of the maiden who marvelled at the apples of the Hesperides;
then he draped the sisters of Phaethon with the bitter moss
of bark, and raised tall alders up from the ground.
Then he sang of Gallus wandering to the rivers of the Permessus,
where one of the sisters led him into the Aonian mountains,
and the whole choir of Phoebus stood up for the man;
while the shepherd Linus, draped in blossoms, lilies
and bitter parsley, recited this to him in a divine song:
"The Muses give you these reeds, here, accept them,
which once were the old man of Ascra's; with them he was wont
to sing the rough ash trees down from the mountains.
May the origin of Apollo's copse be declaimed by you with these,
that there be no other grove in which Apollo boasts the more."
