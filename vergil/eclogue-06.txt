Prima Syracosio dignata est ludere uersu
nostra, neque erubuit siluas habitare, Thalia.
Cum canerem reges et proelia, Cynthius aurem
uellit, et admonuit: "Pastorem, Tityre, pinguis
pascere oportet ouis, deductum dicere carmen."               5
Nunc ego (namque super tibi erunt, qui dicere laudes,
Vare, tuas cupiant, et tristia condere bella)
agrestem tenui meditabor harundine musam.
Non iniussa cano. Si quis tamen haec quoque, si quis
captus amore leget, te nostrae, Vare, myricae,               10
te nemus omne canet; nec Phoebo gratior ulla est
quam sibi quae Vari praescripsit pagina nomen.
Pergite, Pierides. Chromis et Mnasylus in antro
Silenum pueri somno uidere iacentem,
inflatum hesterno uenas, ut semper, Iaccho;               15
serta procul tantum capiti delapsa iacebant,
et grauis attrita pendebat cantharus ansa.
Adgressi (nam saepe senex spe carminis ambo
luserat) iniciunt ipsis ex uincula sertis.
Addit se sociam timidisque superuenit Aegle.               20
========================================

First, our Thalia thought it fit to play with Syracusan verse,
nor did she blush to live in the woods.
When I would sing of kings and battles, Apollo plucked my ear
and admonished me: "Tityrus, it is right for the shepherd
to graze fat sheep, but sing a fine-spun song."
Now I (For there will be more than enough of those who wish
to declaim your praises, Varus, and to celebrate sorrowful wars.)
will meditate on the rustic muse with a slender reed.
I do not sing unbidden.  Still, if anyone reads these, anyone
captured by love that is, our tamarisks and every wood, Varus,
will sing of you; and nothing pleases Phoebus more
than the page on which he wrote the name of Varus.
Proceed, Muses.  The boys Chromis and Mnasylus
saw Silenus, lying asleep in a cave,
bloated, as always, by yesterday's wine;
His garlands lay apart, having slipped from his head,
and a heavy mug hung by its worn-out handle.
They fell upon him (For the old man had often played them both with their hopes
for a song.) and threw him into fetters made from his own garlands.
Then Aegle arrives and joins up as an ally for the timid boys.
========================================
Aegle, Naiadum pulcherrima, iamque uidenti
sanguineis frontem moris et tempora pingit.
Ille dolum ridens: "Quo uincula nectitis?" inquit.
"Soluite me, pueri; satis est potuisse uideri.
Carmina quae uoltis cognoscite; carmina uobis,               25
huic aliud mercedis erit." Simul incipit ipse.
Tum uero in numerum Faunosque ferasque uideres
ludere, tum rigidas motare cacumina quercus.
Nec tantum Phoebo gaudet Parnasia rupes,
nec tantum Rhodope miratur et Ismarus Orphea.               30
Namque canebat uti magnum per inane coacta
semina terrarumque animaeque marisque fuissent
et liquidi simul ignis; ut his exordia primis
omnia, et ipse tener mundi concreuerit orbis;
tum durare solum et discludere Nerea ponto               35
coeperit, et rerum paulatim sumere formas;
iamque nouom terrae stupeant lucescere solem,
altius atque cadant submotis nubibus imbres,
incipiant siluae cum primum surgere, cumque
rara per ignaros errent animalia montis.               40
========================================

Aegle, the fairest of the Naiads, now annoints
the seer's brow and temples with blood-red mulberries.
Laughing at this fraud, he says, "Why are you tying the fetters?
Release me, boys; It's enough to have seen what you can do.
The songs that you wish to learn; songs for you,
there'll be a different wage for her." And he begins at once.
Then you might truly see both Fauns and wild beasts dancing
to the rhythm, then the hardy oaks waving their tops.
The Parnasian cliff doesn't rejoice so well in Phoebus,
nor does even Ismarus Orphea marvel so at Rhodope.
Indeed, he sang of how the collected elements of earth
and air and water existed throughout the great void, 
and of bright fire as well; how the young world itself
spun the warp and weft from these primary elements;
then began to firm up the soil, and break Nereus off
from the sea, and things bit by bit assumed their form;
now, the lands gazed in wonder at the new sun shining,
and the rains fell from clouds pushed higher,
when first the forests began to rise, and scattered
bands of animals wandered across the unknowing mountains.
