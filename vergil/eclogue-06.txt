Prima Syracosio dignata est ludere uersu
nostra, neque erubuit siluas habitare, Thalia.
Cum canerem reges et proelia, Cynthius aurem
uellit, et admonuit: "Pastorem, Tityre, pinguis
pascere oportet ouis, deductum dicere carmen."               5
Nunc ego (namque super tibi erunt, qui dicere laudes,
Vare, tuas cupiant, et tristia condere bella)
agrestem tenui meditabor harundine musam.
Non iniussa cano. Si quis tamen haec quoque, si quis
captus amore leget, te nostrae, Vare, myricae,               10
te nemus omne canet; nec Phoebo gratior ulla est
quam sibi quae Vari praescripsit pagina nomen.
Pergite, Pierides. Chromis et Mnasylus in antro
Silenum pueri somno uidere iacentem,
inflatum hesterno uenas, ut semper, Iaccho;               15
serta procul tantum capiti delapsa iacebant,
et grauis attrita pendebat cantharus ansa.
Adgressi (nam saepe senex spe carminis ambo
luserat) iniciunt ipsis ex uincula sertis.
Addit se sociam timidisque superuenit Aegle.               20
========================================

First, our Thalia thought it apt to mock the Syrachusian in verse,
nor will she blush to live in the woods.
When I sang of kings and battles, Cynthius plucked his ear,
and admonished: "Tityrus, it is right for the shepherd
to graze fat sheep, but declaim a fine-spun poem."
Now I (For the glories will also for you, whoever might recite them,
Varus, let them envy your glories, and to store up sorrowful wars)
I'll contemplate the rustic muse with a slender reed.
Not unbidden do I sing.  Still, if anyone reads these, anyone
captured by love that is, >you our tamarisks, Varus,
every forest will sing of you; and not to Phoebus more pleasing anyf is
than to self which(fnn) the name of Varus directs with a page.
Proceed, Muses.  The boys Chromis and Mnasylus
saw Silenus, lying asleep in a cave,
>puffed out by/to yesterdays >veins, as always, Jacchus;
clover was lying drooped far off so much of cow fodder,
and a heavy drinking vessel was hanging by its worn-out handle/
those having approached (for often an old man of/with hope of a song both/each
he had played/mocked) the chains hurl themselves out of garlands/clover.
Aegle adds herself >partner and to/by timid ones arrives.
