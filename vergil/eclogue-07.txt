Meliboeus

Forte sub arguta consederat ilice Daphnis,
compulerantque greges Corydon et Thyrsis in unum,
Thyrsis ouis, Corydon distentas lacte capellas,
ambo florentes aetatibus, Arcades ambo,
et cantare pares et repondere parati.               5
Huc mihi, dum teneras defendo a frigore myrtos,
uir gregis ipse caper deerrauerat; atque ego Daphnim
adspicio. Ille ubi me contra uidet: "Ocius" inquit
"huc ades, o Meliboee; caper tibi saluos et haedi,
et, si quid cessare potes, requiesce sub umbra.               10
Huc ipsi potum uenient per prata iuuenci;
hic uiridis tenera praetexit harundine ripas
Mincius, eque sacra resonant examina quercu.”
Quid facerem? Neque ego Alcippen, nec Phyllida habebam,
depulsos a lacte domi quae clauderet agnos,               15
et certamen erat, Corydon cum Thyrside, magnum.
Posthabui tamen illorum mea seria ludo.
Alternis igitur contendere uersibus ambo
coepere; alternos Musae meminisse uolebant.
Hos Corydon, illos referebat in ordine Thyrsis.               20
========================================
Meliboeus:

Perhaps Daphnis had sat down under a melodious holm-oak,
and Corydon and Thyrsis had rounded up the flocks into one,
Thyrsis the sheep, and Corydon the goats, heavy with milk,
both blooming in ages, both Arcadian,
and equals in singing and to/by weight prepared.
Here where my billy-goat, the very husband of the flock, had wandered to
while I guarded tender myrtles from the cold; and I spied Daphnis.
When he saw me facing, he said: "You're here sooner
Melodious; your goat and kids are safe,
and, if you can stop whatever you're doing, take a rest in the shade.
>drink those young bulls of yours will come here through the meadows;
here the Mincius borders green banks with a tender reed,
and swarms of bees resound out of the sacred oak."
What should I do?  I had neither Alcippes nor Phyllis,
which he shut the weaned lambs away from milk at home,
and the contest, Corydon against Thyrsis, was great.
I nevertheless esteemed my serious things of those less than play.
Alternating therefore they both began to compete in verse;
>alternate of Muse/Muses to have remembered they wished.
>These Corydon, >those Thyrsis gave back in order.
