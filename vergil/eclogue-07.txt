Meliboeus

Forte sub arguta consederat ilice Daphnis,
compulerantque greges Corydon et Thyrsis in unum,
Thyrsis ouis, Corydon distentas lacte capellas,
ambo florentes aetatibus, Arcades ambo,
et cantare pares et repondere parati.               5
Huc mihi, dum teneras defendo a frigore myrtos,
uir gregis ipse caper deerrauerat; atque ego Daphnim
adspicio. Ille ubi me contra uidet: "Ocius" inquit
"huc ades, o Meliboee; caper tibi saluos et haedi,
et, si quid cessare potes, requiesce sub umbra.               10
Huc ipsi potum uenient per prata iuuenci;
hic uiridis tenera praetexit harundine ripas
Mincius, eque sacra resonant examina quercu.‚Äù
Quid facerem? Neque ego Alcippen, nec Phyllida habebam,
depulsos a lacte domi quae clauderet agnos,               15
et certamen erat, Corydon cum Thyrside, magnum.
Posthabui tamen illorum mea seria ludo.
Alternis igitur contendere uersibus ambo
coepere; alternos Musae meminisse uolebant.
Hos Corydon, illos referebat in ordine Thyrsis.               20
========================================
Meliboeus:

By chance Daphnis was sitting beneath a melodious holm-oak,
and Corydon and Thyrsis had rounded their flocks up together,
Thyrsis the sheep, and Corydon the goats, heavy with milk,
both in the prime of life, both Arcadian,
and equals in singing and ready for repartee.
My billy-goat, the very husband of the flock, had wandered here
while I wrapped tender myrtles against the cold; and I spied Daphnis.
When he saw my face, he said: "You're here in time,
Melodious; your goat and kids are safe, and,
if you can stop whatever you're doing, take a rest in the shade.
Those bullocks of yours will come across the meadows to drink here;
Here the Mincius fringes its green banks with tender reeds,
and swarms of bees re-echo from the sacred oak."
What could I do?  I had neither Alcippes nor Phyllis,
who shut the weaned lambs away from the milk at home,
and the contest, Corydon against Thyrsis, was momentous.
Nevertheless I neglected my serious matters of those for a diversion.
And so they both to compete in alternating verses;
the Muses wished to remember each verse in its turn.
Corydon recited these, and Thyrsis gave back those in order.
