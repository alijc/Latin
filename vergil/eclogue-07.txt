Meliboeus

Forte sub arguta consederat ilice Daphnis,
compulerantque greges Corydon et Thyrsis in unum,
Thyrsis ouis, Corydon distentas lacte capellas,
ambo florentes aetatibus, Arcades ambo,
et cantare pares et repondere parati.               5
Huc mihi, dum teneras defendo a frigore myrtos,
uir gregis ipse caper deerrauerat; atque ego Daphnim
adspicio. Ille ubi me contra uidet: "Ocius" inquit
"huc ades, o Meliboee; caper tibi saluos et haedi,
et, si quid cessare potes, requiesce sub umbra.               10
Huc ipsi potum uenient per prata iuuenci;
hic uiridis tenera praetexit harundine ripas
Mincius, eque sacra resonant examina quercu.‚Äù
Quid facerem? Neque ego Alcippen, nec Phyllida habebam,
depulsos a lacte domi quae clauderet agnos,               15
et certamen erat, Corydon cum Thyrside, magnum.
Posthabui tamen illorum mea seria ludo.
Alternis igitur contendere uersibus ambo
coepere; alternos Musae meminisse uolebant.
Hos Corydon, illos referebat in ordine Thyrsis.               20
========================================
Meliboeus:

By chance Daphnis had sat beneath a melodious holm-oak,
and Corydon and Thyrsis had rounded their flocks up together,
Thyrsis the sheep, and Corydon the goats, heavy with milk,
both men in the prime of life, Arcadian both,
equals in singing, and ready for repartee.
My billy-goat, the very husband of the flock, had wandered here
while I wrapped the tender myrtles against the cold; and I spied Daphnis.
When he saw my face, he said: "Come here quickly,
Meliboeus; your goat and kids are safe.
If you can stop whatever you're doing, take a rest in the shade.
Those bullocks of yours will come here from across the meadows to drink;
Here the Mincius fringes its green banks with tender reeds,
and swarms of bees re-echo from the sacred oak."
What could I do?  I had neither Alcippes nor Phyllis,
who cooped the weaned lambs up at home,
and the contest, Corydon against Thyrsis, was momentous.
Nevertheless I neglected my serious business for their entertainment.
And so they each began to compete in alternating verses;
the Muses preferred to bear alternating verses in mind.
Corydon recited these, and Thyrsis gave back those in turn.
========================================

Corydon:

Nymphae, noster amor, Libethrides, aut mihi carmen,
quale meo Codro, concedite (proxima Phoebi
uersibus ille facit), aut, si non possumus omnes,
hic arguta sacra pendebit fistula pinu.

Thyrsis:

Pastores, hedera nascentem ornate poetam,               25
Arcades, inuidia rumpantur ut ilia Codro;
aut, si ultra placitum laudarit, baccare frontem
cingite, ne uati noceat mala lingua futuro.

Corydon:

Saetosi caput hoc apri tibi, Delia, paruos
et ramosa Micon uiuacis cornua cerui.               30
Si proprium hoc fuerit, leui de marmore tota
puniceo stabis suras euincta coturno.
========================================
Corydon:

Nymphs of Libethra, my loves, either grant me a song,
the like to my Codrus, (he writes ones nearly 
like Phoebus' verses), or, if we all cannot so do,
my tuneful pipe will hang here from the sacred pine.

Thyrsis:

Arcadian shepherds, deck the burgeoning poet with ivy,
so that Codrus' guts would bust with envy;
or, if he would praise beyond what's right, crown my brow 
with foxglove, lest he harm a rising bard with his evil tongue.

Corydon:

Maid of Delos, young Micon offers you this shaggy boar's head
and the branching antlers of a long-lived stag. 
If this be lasting, all in smooth marble 
you'll stand, your calves laced up in red buskins.
========================================

Thyrsis

Sinum lactis et haec te liba, Priape, quotannis
exspectare sat est: custos es pauperis horti.
Nunc te marmoreum pro tempore fecimus; at tu,               35
si fetura gregem suppleuerit, aureus esto.

Corydon

Nerine Galatea, thymo mihi dulcior Hyblae,
candidior cycnis, hedera formosior alba,
cum primum pasti repetent praesepia tauri,
si qua tui Corydonis habet te cura, uenito.               40

Thyrsis

Immo ego Sardoniis uidear tibi amarior herbis
horridior rusco, proiecta uilior alga,
si mihi non haec lux toto iam longior anno est.
Ite domum pasti, si quis pudor, ite, iuuenci.
========================================

Thyrsis:

It's enough for you to expect a bowl of milk and these cakes
every year, Priapus: you are the protector of a poor garden.
We've already made you in marble, according to our circumstances; but,
if the breeding season fills out the flock, you'll be of gold.

Corydon:

Nereus' Galatea, sweeter to me than the thyme of Hybla,
whiter than swans, fairer than pale ivy,
as soon as the grazing bulls return to the barn,
if you have any care for Corydon, come.

Thyrsis:

No indeed. May I seem bitterer than the Sardinian herb,
rougher than broom, worth less than sea-weed that's been thrown away,
if this day is not already longer to me than a whole year.
Go home, my grazing bullocks, if you have any decency, then go.
