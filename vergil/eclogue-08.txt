Pastorum musam Damonis et Alphesiboei,
immemor herbarum quos est mirata iuuenca
certantis, quorum stupefactae carmine lynces,
et mutata suos requierunt flumina cursus,
Damonis musam dicemus et Alphesiboei.               5
     Tu mihi seu magni superas iam saxa Timaui,
siue oram Illyrici legis aequoris, en erit umquam
ille dies, mihi cum liceat tua dicere facta?
En erit, ut liceat totum mihi ferre per orbem
sola Sophocleo tua carmina digna coturno?               10
A te principium; tibi desinet: accipe iussis
carmina coepta tuis, atque hanc sine tempora circum
inter uictricis hederam tibi serpere laurus.
     Frigida uix caelo noctis decesserat umbra,
cum ros in tenera pecori gratissimus herba,               15
incumbens tereti Damon sic coepit oliuae:
==========================================

Let us proclaim the muse of of the shepherds Damon and Alphesiboeus;
a heifer marvelled at them, forgetting the grass,
lynxes were struck dumb by their song
and rivers changed their course.
    Whether you now surmount the rocks of the great Timavo,
or skirt the seashore of Illyria, will I ever see the day 
when I'm allowed your deeds to tell?
Will I? And be able to carry through the whole world 
your songs, alone suitable for the dramatist Sophocles?
From you was the beginning; to you will be the end: accept the songs begun
by your command, and let this ivy wind around your temples
between the victor's laurels.
    Scarcely had night's cold shadow withdrawn from the sky,
when the dew on tender grass is most welcome to the herd,
Damon, leaning on a smooth olive tree, begins thus:
