Pastorum musam Damonis et Alphesiboei,
immemor herbarum quos est mirata iuuenca
certantis, quorum stupefactae carmine lynces,
et mutata suos requierunt flumina cursus,
Damonis musam dicemus et Alphesiboei.               5
     Tu mihi seu magni superas iam saxa Timaui,
siue oram Illyrici legis aequoris, en erit umquam
ille dies, mihi cum liceat tua dicere facta?
En erit, ut liceat totum mihi ferre per orbem
sola Sophocleo tua carmina digna coturno?               10
A te principium; tibi desinet: accipe iussis
carmina coepta tuis, atque hanc sine tempora circum
inter uictricis hederam tibi serpere laurus.
     Frigida uix caelo noctis decesserat umbra,
cum ros in tenera pecori gratissimus herba,               15
incumbens tereti Damon sic coepit oliuae:

and lynxes were struck dumb by the song
and rivers changed their course,
let us proclaim the muse of Damon and of Alphesiboeus.
    For me whether you now surmount the rocks of the great Timavo,
or skirt the seashore of Illyricum, will that day ever come
when I'm allowed your deeds to tell?
Yea, it will, and I'll be able to report through the whole world 
that your songs alone are suitable to the dramatist Sophocles?
From you was the beginning; to you will I finish: accept the songs begun
by your command, and let this ivy wind around your temples
between the victor's laurels.
    Scarcely had night's cold shadow withdrawn from the sky,
when the dew on tender grass is most welcome to the herd,
Damon, leaning on a smooth olive tree, begins thus:
