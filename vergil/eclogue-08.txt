Pastorum musam Damonis et Alphesiboei,
immemor herbarum quos est mirata iuuenca
certantis, quorum stupefactae carmine lynces,
et mutata suos requierunt flumina cursus,
Damonis musam dicemus et Alphesiboei.               5

cum ros in tenera pecori gratissimus herba,               15
incumbens tereti Damon sic coepit oliuae:

Lo it will be, so that I might be permitted through the whole world 
only your worthiy songs toby the actor Sophocles?

From you beginning; to you it will/may it finish: take toby commands
songs begun to your(p), and allow this(f) around the time
between the ivy of the victor to you the laurel to crawl.

    Scarcely had the cold shadow of night withdrawn from the sky,
when the dew on the tender grass, most welcome to the herd,
Damon, leaning on a smooth olive tree, begins thus:
