Pastorum musam Damonis et Alphesiboei,
immemor herbarum quos est mirata iuuenca
certantis, quorum stupefactae carmine lynces,
et mutata suos requierunt flumina cursus,
Damonis musam dicemus et Alphesiboei.               5
     Tu mihi seu magni superas iam saxa Timaui,
siue oram Illyrici legis aequoris, en erit umquam
ille dies, mihi cum liceat tua dicere facta?
En erit, ut liceat totum mihi ferre per orbem
sola Sophocleo tua carmina digna coturno?               10
A te principium; tibi desinet: accipe iussis
carmina coepta tuis, atque hanc sine tempora circum
inter uictricis hederam tibi serpere laurus.
     Frigida uix caelo noctis decesserat umbra,
cum ros in tenera pecori gratissimus herba,               15
incumbens tereti Damon sic coepit oliuae:
==========================================

Let us proclaim the muse of of the shepherds Damon and Alphesiboeus;
a heifer marvelled at them, forgetting the grass,
lynxes were struck dumb by their song
and rivers changed their course.
    Whether you now surmount the rocks of the great Timavo,
or skirt the seashore of Illyria, will I ever see the day 
when I'm allowed your deeds to tell?
Will I? And be able to carry through the whole world 
your songs, alone suitable for the dramatist Sophocles?
From you was the beginning; to you will be the end: accept the songs begun
by your command, and let this ivy wind around your temples
between the victor's laurels.
    Scarcely had night's cold shadow withdrawn from the sky,
when the dew on tender grass is most welcome to the herd,
Damon, leaning on a smooth olive staff, begins thus:
==========================================

‚ÄùNascere, praeque diem ueniens age, Lucifer, almum,
coniugis indigno Nysae deceptus amore
dum queror, et diuos, quamquam nil testibus illis
profeci, extrema moriens tamen adloquor hora.               20

      Incipe Maenalios mecum, mea tibia, uersus.

Maenalus argutumque nemus pinosque loquentis
semper habet; semper pastorum ille audit amores
Panaque, qui primus calamos non passus inertis.

      Incipe Maenalios mecum, mea tibia, uersus.               25

Mopso Nysa datur: quid non speremus amantes?
Iungentur iam grypes equis, aeuoque sequenti
cum canibus timidi ueniet ad pocula dammae.

      Incipe Maenalios mecum, mea tibia, uersus.               28a

Mopse, nouas incide faces: tibi ducitur uxor;
sparge, marite, nuces: tibi deserit Hesperus Oetam.               30

      Incipe Maenalios mecum, mea tibia, uersus.

O digno coniuncta uiro, dum despicis omnis,
dumque tibi est odio mea fistula dumque capellae
hirsutumque supercilium promissaque barba,
nec curare deum credis mortalia quemquam!               35

      Incipe Maenalios mecum, mea tibia, uersus.

========================================

Rise up, Morning Star, and lead in the coming nurturing day,
while I lament, deceived by my spouse Nysa in her undeserving love,
and call on the divine ones, in my final dying hour,
though I have accomplished nothing through these witnesses.

       Begin the Arcadian verses with me, my flute.

Arcadia always has both rustling woods and murmuring pines;
it always listens to the loves of shepherds and Pan,
who first did not allow idle pipes.

       Begin the Arcadian verses with me, my flute.

Nysa is given to Mopsus: what might we lovers not hope for?
That griffins are now joined to horses, and in the coming age
the timid deer will come to drink with dogs.

       Begin the Arcadian verses with me, my flute.

Mopsus, cut fresh torches: your wife is being brought to you;
Scatter the nuts, husband: the Evening Star gives Oeta up for you.

       Begin the Arcadian verses with me, my flute.

Oh, joined to a worthy man, while you despise them all,
and to you is hated while my flute and goats
and shaggy eyebrows and flowing beard,
and you don't believe that any god regards mortal things.

       Begin the Arcadian verses with me, my flute.
