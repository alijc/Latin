Quid faciat laetas segetes, quo sidere terram
uertere, Maecenas, ulmisque adiungere uitis
conueniat, quae cura boum, qui cultus habendo
sit pecori, apibus quanta experientia parcis,
hinc canere incipiam. uos, o clarissima mundi               5
lumina, labentem caelo quae ducitis annum;
Liber et alma Ceres, uestro si munere tellus
Chaoniam pingui glandem mutauit arista,
poculaque inuentis Acheloia miscuit uuis;
et uos, agrestum praesentia numina, Fauni               10
(ferte simul Faunique pedem Dryadesque puellae:
munera uestra cano); tuque o, cui prima frementem
fudit equum magno tellus percussa tridenti,
Neptune; et cultor nemorum, cui pinguia Ceae
ter centum niuei tondent dumeta iuuenci;               15
========================================
From here I'll undertake to sing, Maecenas,
of what produces bountiful crops,
of which star to turn the ground under,
of how to couple vines to elms,
of the care of oxen,
of the labor there is in breeding cattle,
and of how great is the endeavor with thrifty bees.
Oh you, most illustrious lights of the world,
who draw the gliding year along the sky;
Liber and nourishing Ceres,
if by your office the earth changed a Chaonian acorn to a rich grain-ear,
and blended Acheloian draughts with new-found grapes;
and you, Fauns, the present deities of the countrymen,
(beat your feet, both Fauns and Dryad maids together: I sing your offices);
and you, Neptune, for whom the earth poured out the first snorting horse,
after a stroke from your great trident;
you who live in the groves, for whom
three hundred snow-white bullocks graze Cea's abundant thorn-hedges;
========================================
ipse nemus linquens patrium saltusque Lycaei&
Pan, ouium custos, tua si tibi Maenala curae,&
adsis, o Tegeaee, fauens, oleaeque Minerua&
inuentrix, uncique puer monstrator aratri,&
et teneram ab radice ferens, Siluane, cupressum: &              20
dique deaeque omnes, studium quibus arua tueri,&
quique nouas alitis non ullo semine fruges&
quique satis largum caelo demittitis imbrem.&
tuque adeo, quem mox quae sint habitura deorum&
concilia incertum est, urbisne inuisere, Caesar, &              25
terrarumque uelis curam, et te maximus orbis&
auctorem frugum tempestatumque potentem&
accipiat cingens materna tempora myrto;&
an deus immensi uenias maris ac tua nautae&
numina sola colant, tibi seruiat ultima Thule,  &             30
teque sibi generum Tethys emat omnibus undis;
========================================
And you, great Tegean Pam, custodian of sheep,
if you care for your Mount Maenalus,
leave your father's forest and Lycean woodlands and be near at hand,
and also you, Minerva, who created the olive-tree,
and the lad who invented the curved plow,
and Silvanus, carrying a tender cypress by its root:
and all gods and goddesses, who protect the fields with zeal,
both you who rear fresh crops without any seed
and you who let enough plentiful rain fall from the sky.
And even you, Caesar, though it is uncertain,
if the coming councils of the gods will hold you to watch over the cities,
or would you prefer the care of the countryside,
and have the great world accept you as the mighty author of crops and seasons,
girding your mother's brow with myrtle.
Or come as the god of the boundless sea,
and let your presence alone protect the sailor.
May furthest Thule serve you, and may,
by all the billows, Tethys gain you for her son-in-law;
========================================
anne nouum tardis sidus te mensibus addas,&
qua locus Erigonen inter Chelasque sequentis&
panditur (ipse tibi iam bracchia contrahit ardens&
Scorpius et caeli iusta plus parte reliquit);  &             35
quidquid eris (nam te nec sperant Tartara regem,&
nec tibi regnandi ueniat tam dira cupido,&
quamuis Elysios miretur Graecia campos&
nec repetita sequi curet Proserpina matrem),&
da facilem cursum atque audacibus adnue coeptis,    &           40
ignarosque uiae mecum miseratus agrestis&
ingredere et uotis iam nunc adsuesce uocari.&
      Vere nouo, gelidus canis cum montibus umor&
liquitur et Zephyro putris se glaeba resoluit,&
depresso incipiat iam tum mihi taurus aratro   &            45
ingemere et sulco attritus splendescere uomer.
========================================
or might you insert yourself as a new star for the sluggish months,
in the space between Virgo and the Scorpion's claws that spread behind her
(Blazing Scorpio himself now draws his arms in for you
and relinquishes a proper portion of the sky);
whatever you will be (For Hades dares not look for you for their king,
nor should such a dread wish come to you to reign there,
however much Greece might marvel at Elysian fields
nor might fetched-back Proserpina attend to follow her mother.)
give us an easy course and nod at bold undertakings,
and proceed with me, a pitied rustic, men who don't know their way
and get used to soon be summoned with prayers.

In early spring, ice cold water flows from hoary mountains
and a crumbling clod of dirt frees itself through the West Wind,
may my bull soon start to groan with a plow pressed down
and may the plowshare begin to shine, polished by the furrow.
========================================
illa seges demum uotis respondet auari&
agricolae, bis quae solem, bis frigora sensit;&
illius immensae ruperunt horrea messes.&
ac prius ignotum ferro quam scindimus aequor, &              50
uentos et uarium caeli praediscere morem&
cura sit ac patrios cultusque habitusque locorum,&
et quid quaeque ferat regio et quid quaeque recuset.&
hic segetes, illic ueniunt felicius uuae,&
arborei fetus alibi atque iniussa uirescunt  &              55
gramina. nonne uides, croceos ut Tmolus odores,&
India mittit ebur, molles sua tura Sabaei,&
at Chalybes nudi ferrum uirosaque Pontus&
castorea, Eliadum palmas Epiros equarum?
========================================
At last that field answers the greedy farmer's prayers,
after sensing the sun twice, and twice the frosts;
its boundless harvests burst his barns asunder.
But before we rip the strange/unknown plain with iron than/how,
let our care be first to learn the winds and various customs of the sky
and its ancestral cultivation and the conditions of the places,
and what region might bring whichever things what might reject whichever things.
Here the fields, there the more fertile grapes come,
elsewhere the sapling trees and the grasses turn, unbidden, green.
Don't you see, >yellow/saffron perfume as Tmolus,
India sends ivory, soft one's own frankincense of Saba,
but naked Chalybians >iron and rank castor the Black Sea,
Eliadum the palms >Epirus of mares.
