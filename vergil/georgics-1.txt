Quid faciat laetas segetes, quo sidere terram
uertere, Maecenas, ulmisque adiungere uitis
conueniat, quae cura boum, qui cultus habendo
sit pecori, apibus quanta experientia parcis,
hinc canere incipiam. uos, o clarissima mundi               5
lumina, labentem caelo quae ducitis annum;
Liber et alma Ceres, uestro si munere tellus
Chaoniam pingui glandem mutauit arista,
poculaque inuentis Acheloia miscuit uuis;
et uos, agrestum praesentia numina, Fauni               10
(ferte simul Faunique pedem Dryadesque puellae:
munera uestra cano); tuque o, cui prima frementem
fudit equum magno tellus percussa tridenti,
Neptune; et cultor nemorum, cui pinguia Ceae
ter centum niuei tondent dumeta iuuenci;               15
========================================
From here I'll undertake to sing, Maecenas,
of what produces bountiful crops,
of which star to turn the ground under,
of how to couple vines to elms,
of the care of oxen,
of the labor there is in breeding cattle,
and of how great is the endeavor with thrifty bees.
Oh you, most illustrious lights of the world,
who draw the gliding year along the sky;
Liber and nourishing Ceres,
if by your office the earth changed a Chaonian acorn to a rich grain-ear,
and blended Acheloian draughts with new-found grapes;
and you, Fauns, the present deities of the countrymen,
(beat your feet, both Fauns and Dryad maids together: I sing your offices);
and you, Neptune, for whom the earth poured out the first snorting horse,
after a stroke from your great trident;
you who live in the groves, for whom
three hundred snow-white bullocks graze Cea's abundant thorn-hedges.
