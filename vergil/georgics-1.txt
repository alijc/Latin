Quid faciat laetas segetes, quo sidere terram
uertere, Maecenas, ulmisque adiungere uitis
conueniat, quae cura boum, qui cultus habendo
sit pecori, apibus quanta experientia parcis,
hinc canere incipiam. uos, o clarissima mundi               5
lumina, labentem caelo quae ducitis annum;
Liber et alma Ceres, uestro si munere tellus
Chaoniam pingui glandem mutauit arista,
poculaque inuentis Acheloia miscuit uuis;
et uos, agrestum praesentia numina, Fauni               10
(ferte simul Faunique pedem Dryadesque puellae:
munera uestra cano); tuque o, cui prima frementem
fudit equum magno tellus percussa tridenti,
Neptune; et cultor nemorum, cui pinguia Ceae
ter centum niuei tondent dumeta iuuenci;               15
========================================
From here on I'll start to sing, Maecenas,
of what produces bountiful crops,
with which star to change/turn the earth,
and a vine might agree to join up with elms,
of the treatment of oxen,
the training might be for managing a herd,
with frugal bees such a test.

Oh you most illustrious lights of the world,
that lead the falling year from the sky;
Liber and nourishing Ceres, if by your gift the ground
changed Chaonian acorns to rich grain,
and Acheloia mixed drinking bowls with the grapes that he found;
and you, Fauns >peasant present divine wills
(bring also, both Fauns and dryads lasses >foot/beat a retreat:
I sing of your gifts);
and oh you, to whom first (woman) >roaring
the earth, pierced with a great trident, poured/cast >a horse, Neptune;
and the husbandman of the woods, to whom the fats of Cea
three hundred snow-white bullocks thickets.
