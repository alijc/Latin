Quid faciat laetas segetes, quo sidere terram
uertere, Maecenas, ulmisque adiungere uitis
conueniat, quae cura boum, qui cultus habendo
sit pecori, apibus quanta experientia parcis,
hinc canere incipiam. uos, o clarissima mundi               5
lumina, labentem caelo quae ducitis annum;
Liber et alma Ceres, uestro si munere tellus
Chaoniam pingui glandem mutauit arista,
poculaque inuentis Acheloia miscuit uuis;
et uos, agrestum praesentia numina, Fauni               10
(ferte simul Faunique pedem Dryadesque puellae:
munera uestra cano); tuque o, cui prima frementem
fudit equum magno tellus percussa tridenti,
Neptune; et cultor nemorum, cui pinguia Ceae
ter centum niuei tondent dumeta iuuenci;               15
========================================
From here I'll undertake to sing, Maecenas,
of what produces bountiful crops,
of which star to turn the ground under,
of how to couple vines to elms,
of the care of oxen,
of the labor there is in breeding cattle,
and of how great is the endeavor with thrifty bees.
Oh you, most illustrious lights of the world,
who draw the gliding year along the sky;
Liber and nourishing Ceres,
if by your office the earth changed a Chaonian acorn to a rich grain-ear,
and blended Acheloian draughts with new-found grapes;
and you, Fauns, the present deities of the countrymen,
(beat your feet, both Fauns and Dryad maids together: I sing your offices);
and you, Neptune, for whom the earth poured out the first snorting horse,
after a stroke from your great trident;
you who live in the groves, for whom
three hundred snow-white bullocks graze Cea's abundant thorn-hedges;
========================================
ipse nemus linquens patrium saltusque Lycaei&
Pan, ouium custos, tua si tibi Maenala curae,&
adsis, o Tegeaee, fauens, oleaeque Minerua&
inuentrix, uncique puer monstrator aratri,&
et teneram ab radice ferens, Siluane, cupressum: &              20
dique deaeque omnes, studium quibus arua tueri,&
quique nouas alitis non ullo semine fruges&
quique satis largum caelo demittitis imbrem.&
tuque adeo, quem mox quae sint habitura deorum&
concilia incertum est, urbisne inuisere, Caesar, &              25
terrarumque uelis curam, et te maximus orbis&
auctorem frugum tempestatumque potentem&
accipiat cingens materna tempora myrto;&
an deus immensi uenias maris ac tua nautae&
numina sola colant, tibi seruiat ultima Thule,  &             30
teque sibi generum Tethys emat omnibus undis;
========================================
with Pam, the custodian of sheep,
himself leaving his father's forest and leap of the Lycaeum,
if your Maenalian things to you to/of care,
may you be near, O Tegeaeus, favoring, and Minerva, who invented the olive,
and the boy who guides the curved plow,
and you forest, bearing the cypress, tender from its root:
and all gods and goddesses, zeal to/by whom fields to watch over,
and who rear fresh crops without any seed
and who let sufficiently plentiful rain fall from the sky.

And you indeed, whom soon which councils of the gods might be for thinking
is unsure, lest to watch over the cities, Caesar,
and you might want the care of the lands, and >you the greatest of the worlds
>the mighty author of crops and seasons
may he take, surrounding the maternal seasons toby the myrtle;
and the god of the boundless sea may you come and your
deities of the sailor, who alone honor, may furthest Thule serve you,
and >you to self of births may Tethys gain toby all waves;
