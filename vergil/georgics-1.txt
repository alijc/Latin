Quid faciat laetas segetes, quo sidere terram
uertere, Maecenas, ulmisque adiungere uitis
conueniat, quae cura boum, qui cultus habendo
sit pecori, apibus quanta experientia parcis,
hinc canere incipiam. uos, o clarissima mundi               5
lumina, labentem caelo quae ducitis annum;
Liber et alma Ceres, uestro si munere tellus
Chaoniam pingui glandem mutauit arista,
poculaque inuentis Acheloia miscuit uuis;
et uos, agrestum praesentia numina, Fauni               10
(ferte simul Faunique pedem Dryadesque puellae:
munera uestra cano); tuque o, cui prima frementem
fudit equum magno tellus percussa tridenti,
Neptune; et cultor nemorum, cui pinguia Ceae
ter centum niuei tondent dumeta iuuenci;               15
========================================
From here I'll undertake to sing, Maecenas,
of what produces bountiful crops,
of which star to turn the ground under,
of how to couple vines to elms,
of the care of oxen,
of the labor there is in breeding cattle,
and of how great is the endeavor with thrifty bees.
Oh you, most illustrious lights of the world,
who draw the gliding year along the sky;
Liber and nourishing Ceres,
if by your office the earth changed a Chaonian acorn to a rich grain-ear,
and blended Acheloian draughts with new-found grapes;
and you, Fauns, the present deities of the countrymen,
(beat your feet, both Fauns and Dryad maids together: I sing your offices);
and you, Neptune, for whom the earth poured out the first snorting horse,
after a stroke from your great trident;
you who live in the groves, for whom
three hundred snow-white bullocks graze Cea's abundant thorn-hedges;
========================================
ipse nemus linquens patrium saltusque Lycaei&
Pan, ouium custos, tua si tibi Maenala curae,&
adsis, o Tegeaee, fauens, oleaeque Minerua&
inuentrix, uncique puer monstrator aratri,&
et teneram ab radice ferens, Siluane, cupressum: &              20
dique deaeque omnes, studium quibus arua tueri,&
quique nouas alitis non ullo semine fruges&
quique satis largum caelo demittitis imbrem.&
tuque adeo, quem mox quae sint habitura deorum&
concilia incertum est, urbisne inuisere, Caesar, &              25
terrarumque uelis curam, et te maximus orbis&
auctorem frugum tempestatumque potentem&
accipiat cingens materna tempora myrto;&
an deus immensi uenias maris ac tua nautae&
numina sola colant, tibi seruiat ultima Thule,  &             30
teque sibi generum Tethys emat omnibus undis;
========================================
And you, great Tegean Pam, custodian of sheep,
if you care for your Mount Maenalus,
leave your father's forest and Lycean woodlands and be near at hand,
and also you, Minerva, who created the olive-tree,
and the lad who invented the curved plow,
and Silvanus, carrying a tender cypress by its root:
and all gods and goddesses, who protect the fields with zeal,
both you who rear fresh crops without any seed
and you who let enough plentiful rain to fall from the sky.
And even you, Caesar, though it is uncertain,
if the coming councils of the gods will hold you to watch over the cities,
or would you prefer the care of the countryside,
and have the great world accept you as the mighty author of crops and seasons,
girding your mother's brow with myrtle.
Or, pray you, god of the boundless sea, come,
and let your presence alone protect the sailor.
May furthest Thule serve you, and may,
by all the billows, Tethys gain you for her son-in-law;
