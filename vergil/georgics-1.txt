Quid faciat laetas segetes, quo sidere terram
uertere, Maecenas, ulmisque adiungere uitis
conueniat, quae cura boum, qui cultus habendo
sit pecori, apibus quanta experientia parcis,
hinc canere incipiam. uos, o clarissima mundi               5
lumina, labentem caelo quae ducitis annum;
Liber et alma Ceres, uestro si munere tellus
Chaoniam pingui glandem mutauit arista,
poculaque inuentis Acheloia miscuit uuis;
et uos, agrestum praesentia numina, Fauni               10
(ferte simul Faunique pedem Dryadesque puellae:
munera uestra cano); tuque o, cui prima frementem
fudit equum magno tellus percussa tridenti,
Neptune; et cultor nemorum, cui pinguia Ceae
ter centum niuei tondent dumeta iuuenci;               15
========================================
From here I'll undertake to sing, Maecenas,
of what produces bountiful crops,
of which star to turn the ground under,
of what gathers vines to fix them to elms,
of the care of oxen,
of the labor there is in breeding cattle,
with such an endeavor with frugal bees.
Oh you most illustrious lights of the world,
who pull the gliding year along the sky;
Liber and nourishing Ceres,
if by your office the earth changed a Chaonian acorn to rich grain,
and blended Acheloian drinking bowls with discovered grapes;
and you, Fauns, the present deities of the countrymen,
(beat your feet, both Fauns and Dryad maids together: I sing your offices);
and you, Neptune, for whom the earth poured out the first snorting horse,
pierced with a great trident;
and you tiller of the meadows, for whom Cea's abundant thorn-hedges
shear three hundred snow-white bullocks.
