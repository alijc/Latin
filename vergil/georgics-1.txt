Quid faciat laetas segetes, quo sidere terram
uertere, Maecenas, ulmisque adiungere uitis
conueniat, quae cura boum, qui cultus habendo
sit pecori, apibus quanta experientia parcis,
hinc canere incipiam. uos, o clarissima mundi               5
lumina, labentem caelo quae ducitis annum;
Liber et alma Ceres, uestro si munere tellus
Chaoniam pingui glandem mutauit arista,
poculaque inuentis Acheloia miscuit uuis;
et uos, agrestum praesentia numina, Fauni               10
(ferte simul Faunique pedem Dryadesque puellae:
munera uestra cano); tuque o, cui prima frementem
fudit equum magno tellus percussa tridenti,
Neptune; et cultor nemorum, cui pinguia Ceae
ter centum niuei tondent dumeta iuuenci;               15
========================================
From here I'll undertake to sing, Maecenas,
of what produces bountiful crops,
of which star to turn the ground under,
of how to couple vines to elms
of the care of oxen,
of the labor there is in breeding cattle,
and of how great is the endeavor with thrifty bees.
Oh you, most illustrious lights of the world,
who draw the gliding year along the sky;
Liber and nourishing Ceres,
if by your office the earth changed a Chaonian acorn to a rich grain-ear,
and blended Acheloian draughts with new-found grapes;
and you, Fauns, the present deities of the countrymen,
(beat your feet, both Fauns and Dryad maids together: I sing your offices);
and you, Neptune, for whom the earth poured out the first snorting horse,
after a stroke from your great trident;
you who live in the groves, for whom
three hundred snow-white bullocks graze Cea's abundant thorn-hedges;
========================================
ipse nemus linquens patrium saltusque Lycaei&
Pan, ouium custos, tua si tibi Maenala curae,&
adsis, o Tegeaee, fauens, oleaeque Minerua&
inuentrix, uncique puer monstrator aratri,&
et teneram ab radice ferens, Siluane, cupressum: &              20
dique deaeque omnes, studium quibus arua tueri,&
quique nouas alitis non ullo semine fruges&
quique satis largum caelo demittitis imbrem.&
tuque adeo, quem mox quae sint habitura deorum&
concilia incertum est, urbisne inuisere, Caesar, &              25
terrarumque uelis curam, et te maximus orbis&
auctorem frugum tempestatumque potentem&
accipiat cingens materna tempora myrto;&
an deus immensi uenias maris ac tua nautae&
numina sola colant, tibi seruiat ultima Thule,  &             30
teque sibi generum Tethys emat omnibus undis;
========================================
And you, great Tegean Pam, custodian of sheep,
if you care for your Mount Maenalus,
leave your father's forest and Lycean woodlands and be near at hand,
and also you, Minerva, who created the olive-tree,
and the lad who invented the curved plow,
and Silvanus, carrying a tender cypress by its root:
and all gods and goddesses, who protect the fields with zeal,
both you who rear fresh crops without any seed
and you who let enough plentiful rain fall from the sky.
And even you, Caesar, though it is uncertain,
if the coming councils of the gods will hold you to watch over the cities,
or would you prefer the care of the countryside,
and have the great world accept you as the mighty author of crops and seasons,
girding your mother's brow with myrtle.
Or come as the god of the boundless sea,
and let your presence alone protect the sailor.
May furthest Thule serve you, and may,
by all the billows, Tethys gain you for her son-in-law;
========================================
anne nouum tardis sidus te mensibus addas,&
qua locus Erigonen inter Chelasque sequentis&
panditur (ipse tibi iam bracchia contrahit ardens&
Scorpius et caeli iusta plus parte reliquit);  &             35
quidquid eris (nam te nec sperant Tartara regem,&
nec tibi regnandi ueniat tam dira cupido,&
quamuis Elysios miretur Graecia campos&
nec repetita sequi curet Proserpina matrem),&
da facilem cursum atque audacibus adnue coeptis,    &           40
ignarosque uiae mecum miseratus agrestis&

      Vere nouo, gelidus canis cum montibus umor&
liquitur et Zephyro putris se glaeba resoluit,&
depresso incipiat iam tum mihi taurus aratro   &            45
ingemere et sulco attritus splendescere uomer.
========================================
or might you insert yourself as a new star for the sluggish months,
in the space between Virgo and the Scorpion's claws that spread behind her
(Blazing Scorpio himself now draws his arms in for you
and relinquishes a proper portion of the sky);
whatever you will be (For Hades dares not look for you for their king,
nor should such a dread wish come to you to reign there,
however much Greece might marvel at Elysian fields
nor might fetched-back Proserpina attend to follow her mother.)
give us an easy course and nod at bold undertakings,
and proceed with me, a pitied rustic, men who don't know their way
and get used to soon be summoned with prayers.

In early spring, ice cold water flows from hoary mountains
and a crumbling clod of dirt frees itself through the West Wind,
may my bull soon start to groan with a plow pressed down
and may the plowshare begin to shine, polished by the furrow.
========================================
illa seges demum uotis respondet auari&
agricolae, bis quae solem, bis frigora sensit;&

India mittit ebur, molles sua tura Sabaei,&
at Chalybes nudi ferrum uirosaque Pontus&
castorea, Eliadum palmas Epiros equarum?
========================================
At last that field answers the greedy farmer's prayers,
after sensing the sun twice, and twice the frosts;
its boundless harvests burst his barns asunder.
But before we cleave the unknown plain with iron,
let our care be first to learn the winds and the varying nature of the sky
and its ancestral cultivation and the conditions of its sites,
and what each region might bear, what it might reject.
Here the grain, there the grapes come more fruitfully,
elsewhere the sapling trees and the grasses turn, unbidden, green.
Don't you see how Tmolus sends saffron perfumes,
India ivory, the gentle men of Saba their frankincense,
naked Chalybians iron, the Pontus rank castor oil,
and Epirus the palms of the mares of Elis.
========================================
continuo has leges aeternaque foedera certis  &             60

sed tamen alternis facilis labor, arida tantum&

effetos cinerem immundum iactare per agros.
========================================
Nature imposed the terms of these contracts
on specific places, from the time when first
Deucalion threw stones onto the empty world,
from which a hardy stock of men were born.
So come on, let strong bulls turn over the land's
rich soil right from the first months of the year,
and let the dusty summer heat parch the clods lying in the midsummer sun,
to keep grass from outgrowing the favored crops.
But if the  ground isn't fertile, just as Acturus appears
plow with a somewhat light furrow,
to keep the meager moisture from forsaking the barren sandy soil.

Likewise, let the mowed meadows rest every other year
and the idle field remain in place;
or sow yellow spelt at the change of seasons, there
where you earlier gathered up fruitful beans
with shaking pods or slender fruits of vetch and
brittle reeds and an echoing forest of gloomy lupin.
For a crop of flax dries the field out, as does one of oats,
and poppies bathed in the sleep of Lethe too;
but still every other year makes for easy labor, only
one shouldn't be ashamed to glut parched soils with rich dung
or to throw filthy ashes all through exhausted fields.
========================================
sic quoque mutatis requiescunt fetibus arua,&
nec nulla interea est inaratae gratia terrae.&
saepe etiam sterilis incendere profuit agros&
atque leuem stipulam crepitantibus urere flammis:  &             85
siue inde occultas uiris et pabula terrae&
pinguia concipiunt, siue illis omne per ignem&
excoquitur uitium atque exsudat inutilis umor,&
seu pluris calor ille uias et caeca relaxat&
spiramenta, nouas ueniat qua sucus in herbas, &              90
seu durat magis et uenas astringit hiantis,&
ne tenues pluuiae rapidiue potentia solis&
acrior aut Boreae penetrabile frigus adurat.
========================================
So too changing the crops gives the fields a rest,
nor is the unplowed land ungrateful in the meantime.
It's even often useful to set fire to empty fields
and burn the light stubble with crackling flames:
whether the rich nourishment of the land gets hidden strengths from this
or through this fire each fault boils away
and useless moisture is sweated out,
or maybe that heat loosens more channels and secret pores,
through which the sap may enter the new grasses,
or it might harden and bind the veins gaping wide,
to keep drenching rains or the swift sun's might
or the North Wind's sharper piercing cold from scorching.
========================================
multum adeo, rastris glaebas qui frangit inertis&
uimineasque trahit cratis, iuuat arua, neque illum   &            95
flaua Ceres alto nequiquam spectat Olympo;&
et qui, proscisso quae suscitat aequore terga,&
rursus in obliquum uerso perrumpit aratro&
exercetque frequens tellurem atque imperat aruis.&
      Vmida solstitia atque hiemes orate serenas,   &            100
agricolae; hiberno laetissima puluere farra,&
laetus ager: nullo tantum se Mysia cultu&
iactat et ipsa suas mirantur Gargara messis.&
quid dicam, iacto qui semine comminus arua&
insequitur cumulosque ruit male pinguis harenae,   &            105
deinde satis fluuium inducit riuosque sequentis,&
et, cum exustus ager morientibus aestuat herbis,&
ecce supercilio cliuosi tramitis undam&
elicit? illa cadens raucum per leuia murmur&
saxa ciet, scatebrisque arentia temperat arua.               110
========================================
Indeed, the man who breaks up inert clods of earth with mattocks
and drags wicker harrows assists the soil a great deal,
and not in vain does yellow-haired Ceres watch him from high Olympus;
and he who, after cutting the plain open, lifts up the surfaces,
and turning the plow obliquely breaks through again,
and repeatedly works the earth and commands the plowed fields.

Pray for moist summers and fair winters, farmers;
from winter's dust comes the richest spelt, and a lush field:
with no other cultivation does Mysia boast so much
and Gargara itself marvels at its own harvests.
What can I say?  He who hotly engages the fields after the seed has been cast,
and wickedly crushes the fertile heaps of sand,
then lets running water into what's been planted, and streams after that,
and, when the dried up field burns with dead grass,
look! from the brow of the hilly path he entices water.
This, in falling, drives a hoarse murmur across the smooth stones,
and like a bubbling spring refreshes the parched fields.
========================================
quid qui, ne grauidis procumbat culmus aristis,&
luxuriem segetum tenera depascit in herba,&
cum primum sulcos aequant sata, quique paludis&
collectum umorem bibula deducit harena?&
praesertim incertis si mensibus amnis abundans &              115
exit et obducto late tenet omnia limo,&
unde cauae tepido sudant umore lacunae.&
      Nec tamen, haec cum sint hominumque boumque labores&
uersando terram experti, nihil improbus anser&
Strymoniaeque grues et amaris intiba fibris    &           120
officiunt aut umbra nocet. pater ipse colendi&
haud facilem esse uiam uoluit, primusque per artem&
mouit agros, curis acuens mortalia corda&
nec torpere graui passus sua regna ueterno.&
ante Iouem nulli subigebant arua coloni:    &           125
ne signare quidem aut partiri limite campum&
fas erat; in medium quaerebant, ipsaque tellus&
omnia liberius nullo poscente ferebat.
========================================
And what of he who, for fear the stalk will break under the heavy ears of grain,
grazes out the abundant crop when still tender grass,
just as the crops first come level with the furrows,
and he who diverts the marsh's collected moisture with thirsty sand?
Especially if, in uncertain months, an overflowing river
rises and holds everything with mud spread far and wide,
from which the empty ditches sweat with warm moisture.

And yet, since these are the toils of both men and oxen,
practiced in turning the earth,
no wicked goose or Strymonian cranes or endives with bitter fibers impede,
nor does a shadow do harm.
Our great Father wants no easy path for tilling,
and first disturbs the fields through skill,
whetting mortal minds with cares
and not allowing them to laze with sloth under his weighty reign.
Before Jupiter's time no husbandmen used to plow the fields:
even to mark or divide the fields with a border strip was not just;
they sought for the common good, and the very earth brought all
more freely with no man asking.
========================================

========================================
He added evil venom to deadly serpents
and ordered wolves to prey and the sea to swell.
He shook honey off of leaves and took fire away
and curbed the wine from running in streams everywhere,
so that need in practice would gradually pound out various skills,
and seek out blades of grain in furrows.
To forge the fire hidden in veins of flint.
Then rivers learned of hollow alder trunks;
then a sailor fashioned names and numbers for the stars,
Pleiades, Hyades, and Lycaon's bright Arcturus.
Then to catch wild beasts with snares and trick them with bird-lime
and to set great woodlands round with dogs.
Now one man now casts a net into the broad river, aiming for depth,
while another pulls wet drag-nets through the sea.
Then iron's strength and the grating of saw-blades
(for men of old split fissile wood with wedges),
then different skills arrived. Toil conquered all,
base and hard, weighing all affairs down in poverty.
========================================

heu magnum alterius frustra spectabis aceruum&
concussaque famem in siluis solabere quercu.
========================================
Ceres first made mortals turn the earth with iron,
when the nuts and fruit of her sacred woods fell short,
and Zeus' oracle denied them sustenance.
Soon suffering was even laid onto grain, and evil mildew
ate at the stalks and the lazy thistle bristled in the fields;
the crops are lost, a rough brush - burs and thorns - advances,
and among the thriving fields
wretched darnel and fruitless reeds have mastery.
Because unless you ferret out the grass with constant hoeing
and frighten the birds with noise and prune a dark farm's shade
with a sickle, and summon rain with prayers,
alas! in vain you'll eye your neighbor's heaping crop
and you'll solace your hunger with an oak shaken in the woods.
========================================
Dicendum et quae sint duris agrestibus arma,   &            160
quis sine nec potuere seri nec surgere messes:&
uomis et inflexi primum graue robur aratri,&

omnia quae multo ante memor prouisa repones,&

========================================
It must also be told what arms the hardy countrymen have,
without which the crops couldn't be either sown or grown:
first the heavy oak of the coulter of the curving plow,
and the Eleusinian mother's slow rolling wagons,
and threshing drays and sledges and mattocks of uneven weight;
and also Celeus' cheap wickerware of twigs,
hurdles of arbutus and Iacchus' sacred winnowing fan;
all of which, mindful long since, you will carefully store,
if you would be deemed worthy of  a divine country's renown.
An elm in the woods is tamed, bit by bit, with great force
into a plow beam's curve and takes the form of a curved plow.
From the stock a pole extends out eight feet to it,
two mouldboards, the sharebeam fastened to a double ridge.
A thin linden is chopped down for a yoke in front, and a tall beech
for a handle, which turns the wheels at the very back -
the smoke tests the oak-wood, hanging above the hearth.
========================================
Possum multa tibi ueterum praecepta referre,&

at si luxuria foliorum exuberat umbra,&
nequiquam pinguis palea teret area culmos.
========================================
I can convey to you many rules of old,
unless you run off, cause it irks you to learn the trifling tasks.
First off, you need to level a threshing floor with a huge stone roller
and to turn it over by hand and firm it up with sticky clay,
to keep grass from sneaking in or letting it crack, beaten into dust,
then various pests might mock you: often a paltry mouse
sets up both his house and barn underground,
or weak-eyed moles dig out their lairs,
and a toad found in holes, where the earth bears
countless monsters, and a weevil ravages a vast heap of grain
and an ant dreading a helpless old age.
Observe also, when many an almond-tree in the forests
will clothe itself in flower and bend its fragrant branches:
if the fruit abound, an equally great harvest will follow
and a great threshing will arrive with a great heat;
but if the luxuriant shadow of the leaves overshadows the fruits,
the threshing floor will beat the chaff from the thick stalks in vain.
========================================
semina uidi equidem multos medicare serentis&
et nitro prius et nigra perfundere amurca,&
grandior ut fetus siliquis fallacibus esset    &           195
et quamuis igni exiguo properata maderent.&
uidi lecta diu et multo spectata labore&
degenerare tamen, ni uis humana quotannis&
maxima quaeque manu legeret: sic omnia fatis&
in peius ruere ac retro sublapsa referri, &              200
non aliter quam qui aduerso uix flumine lembum&
remigiis subigit, si bracchia forte remisit,&
atque illum in praeceps prono rapit alueus amni.&
      Praeterea tam sunt Arcturi sidera nobis&
Haedorumque dies seruandi et lucidus Anguis,  &             205
quam quibus in patriam uentosa per aequora uectis&
Pontus et ostriferi fauces temptantur Abydi.
========================================
I have seen, indeed, that many planters steep their seeds,
first with potash and then drenching them with the black dregs of olive oil,
to boil the seed over a fire, howsoever small,
to force it to be more abundant than its deceptive pod.
I have seen that seeds long examined and chosen with much toil still fall short,
unless each year human strength picked the largest out by hand:
thus through fate everything tumbles down into the worse,
slips away and is driven backwards,
just like one who's rowing his skiff upstream, just barely -
if by chance he rests his arms,
the current drags him off headlong down the river.
    Then too, it's as much for us to keep the stars of Acturus 
and the time of the Kid and bright Draco,
as for those who, carried homeward across the windy sea
attempt the Sea and the straits of oyster-bearing Abydos.
========================================
Libra die somnique pares ubi fecerit horas&
et medium luci atque umbris iam diuidit orbem,&
exercete, uiri, tauros, serite hordea campis     &          210

========================================
Men, when Libra balances the hours of day and sleep 
and splits the world in half between light and shadows,
drive your bulls and sow barley in the fields
up until the first fierce storm of winter.
That's the time to cover your flax fields and poppies
with soil and to, without delay, bend over your plow,
so long as dry earth lets you, while the clouds merely hover.
Beans are sown in the spring; then too, alfalfa, 
the crumbly furrows take you in, while the care for millet comes year by year,
radiant Taurus, with his gilded horns, unveils the year
while the Dog-star, withdrawing, sinks from the heavens.
But if you'll use the soil for a harvest of wheat and hardy spelt
and insist on grain alone,
let the Pleiades be hidden from you in the Dawn
and let the star of the blazing Crown of Knossos retire,
before you entrust the seeds you've kept to the furrows
and rush to trust your year's hope to the unwilling earth.
Many did start before Maia set;
but the crop they looked for mocks them with earless straw.
========================================
si uero uiciamque seres uilemque phaselum&
nec Pelusiacae curam aspernabere lentis,&
haud obscura cadens mittet tibi signa Bootes:&
incipe et ad medias sementem extende pruinas.  &             230
      Idcirco certis dimensum partibus orbem&
per duodena regit mundi sol aureus astra.&
quinque tenent caelum zonae: quarum una corusco&
semper sole rubens et torrida semper ab igni;&
quam circum extremae dextra laeuaque trahuntur  &             235
caeruleae, glacie concretae atque imbribus atris;&
has inter mediamque duae mortalibus aegris&
munere concessae diuum, et uia secta per ambas,&
obliquus qua se signorum uerteret ordo.
========================================
If, indeed, you'll sow both vetch and kidney-beans
and won't scorn taking care of Egyptian lentils,
in setting, Bootes will scarcely send you obscure signs:
begin the sowing and stretch it out to the middle of the hoar-frosts.

Therefore the golden sun rules the orb laid out
in shares fixed between heavens' twelve constellations.
Five zones hold the sky: one of which is always reddened
by the flashing sun and always parched by fire.
Around this on the right and left blue ones are drawn,
thickened with ice and black storms.
Between these and the middle one two zones are allowed to feeble mortals
as a gift of the gods, and a path cut between them,
along which the oblique series of signs turns.
========================================

========================================
The world, even as it rises towards Scythia and the steep Riphean mountains,
is pressed down, sloping to the south of Libya.
This pole of ours is always lofty;
but the black River Styx sees the other under its feet,
and the Shades of the abyss as well.
Here, the great Serpent slips along in a sinuous curve
around and through both Bears, like a river,
the Bears that fear being dipped into Ocean's plane.
There, so they say, either the dark night is silent forever
and shadows are made denser in the unchanging night;
or the Dawn turns back from us and leads back the day,
and when the rising Sun first breathes on us with panting horses
there the rosy Evening Star kindles its tardy beams.
From this we can foretell the seasons from the changing sky,
from this both the day and the time of sowing and of reaping,
and when it may be meet to strike the treacherous sea with oars,
when to launch rigged fleets,
or to fell a fitting pine in the forests for a mast;
and not in vain do we observe the settings and risings of the constellations
and the balanced year divided into four seasons.
========================================
Frigidus agricolam si quando continet imber,&

========================================
Whenever a cool rain keeps the farmer at home,
many things, that would be done in haste under a clear sky,
are given time to be done well:
the plowman hammers out his blunted plowshare's sturdy spike,
he hollows out a tree trunk for troughs,
or stamps his mark on his cattle or numbers on his stacks of grain.
Some sharpen stakes and two-pronged forks
and prepare Amerian withes for the twining vine.
Now let a basket be woven out of pliant bramble twigs,
roast the grain over a fire now, then crush it with a stone.
By all means, even on festival days they allow that
it is right and lawful to do some work:
no piety forbids you from drawing off streams,
extending hedges for a field,
setting snares for birds, setting fire to thorn-bushes
and dipping a bleating flock into a health-giving river.
Often the drover loads the ribs of his slow ass with oil
or with cheap fruit, and on his return carries a
sharpened millstone or a lump of black pitch back from the city.
========================================
Ipsa dies alios alio dedit ordine luna&
felicis operum. quintam fuge: pallidus Orcus&

nocte leues melius stipulae, nocte arida prata&
tondentur, noctes lentus non deficit umor.               290

========================================
The Moon herself made some days fair for each work in its turn.
Avoid the fifth: when pale Death and the Furies sprang to life;
then when the Earth in horrid labor gave birth to
Coeus and Iapetus and savage Typhoeus
and the brothers who plotted to destroy heaven.
Three times, you see, they tried to pile Mount Ossa upon Mount Pelio
and to roll leafy Olympus upon Ossa;
three times our Father broke up the heaped up mountains with a thunderbolt.
Seven days after the tenth is good for planting a vine
and breaking oxen to the harness and adding woof to warp.
The ninth is better for the runaway, otherwise for thefts.

Many things far better lend themselves to the cold night
or under the young sun when Dawn drops dew on the lands.
Better to cut slender stalks in the night, dry meadows in the night,
clinging moisture doesn't forsake the nights.

========================================

========================================
And a certain man watches by the evening flames of wintry light
and splits torch-ends with sharpened iron.
Meanwhile, solacing her extended toil with a song,
his spouse runs a lively comb over the warp,
or boils away the liquid from sweet young wine over a fire
and skims the foam from the boiling pot with leaves.
But red-haired Ceres is cut down at mid-summer
and at mid-summer treads the roasted crops out on the threshing floor.
Strip down to plow, strip down to plant.  Wintertime is idle for the husbandman:
in cold weather the gains of the farmer are often enjoyed
and happy men arrange mutual dinners among themselves.
Winter enlivens man and loosens care,
just like laden boats that have now reached their port,
and happy sailors garland their sterns.
And yet it's the time not only to pluck the oaks' acorns
and laurel berries and olives and bleeding myrtle-berry,
but also to set snares for cranes and nets for deer
and to chase down longeared hares, and to strike fallow deer
with a whirl of hempen Balearian sling,
when the snow lies deep, when rivers drive the ice.
========================================
Quid tempestates autumni et sidera dicam,&

========================================
What shall I say of the storms of autumn and of their stars,
and what men should watch for, now when the day is shorter and heat milder?
Or how the spring rain rushes down,
when the harvest has already bristled in the fields
and the heads of milky grain swell on green stalks?
Often, when the farmer brought the reaper to the golden fields
and then he stripped the barley from its brittle stalk,
I saw all the winds charge together into battle,
plucking the swollen crop up from its deepest root
and flinging it far and wide: thus may winter carry
light straw and flying stalks in a black whirlwind.
Yet often a vast column of water appears in the sky
and the clouds assembled from on high conglomerate into a foul storm
with coal-black showers; the towering ether rushes down
and with a monstrous rain washes away the joyful standing crops
and oxen's labors; ditches fill up and hollow rivers crest
and the sea boils with a roar in a raging blow.
========================================

tum pingues agni et tum mollissima uina,&
tum somni dulces densaeque in montibus umbrae.
========================================
In the middle of the stormy night our great Father
wields flashing thunderbolts in his right hand,
and at that gesture the vast earth trembles,
wild beasts flee and, and terror spreads
through the mortal hearts of a humble people;
he hurls a flaming dart onto Athos or Rhodope or tall Cereria;
South Winds and driving rain redouble;
now the forests, now the shores bewail the unnatural wind.
In fear of this, give heed to heaven's months and constellations,
and the way that Saturn's cold star withdraws,
and the circles that Mercury's glow roves in the sky.
First of all, venerate the gods, and pay to Great Ceres
her annual rites, sacrificing on joyful grass
at the utter end of winter, now in fair spring.
Then lambs are fat and wines are mild,
then dreams are sweet and shadows dense in the mountains.
========================================
cuncta tibi Cererem pubes agrestis adoret:&
cui tu lacte fauos et miti dilue Baccho,&
terque nouas circum felix eat hostia fruges,  &             345

et Cererem clamore uocent in tecta; neque ante&
falcem maturis quisquam supponat aristis&
quam Cereri torta redimitus tempora quercu&
det motus incompositos et carmina dicat.   &            350
      Atque haec ut certis possemus discere signis,&
aestusque pluuiasque et agentis frigora uentos,&
ipse pater statuit quid menstrua luna moneret,&
quo signo caderent Austri, quid saepe uidentes&
agricolae propius stabulis armenta tenerent.  &             355
continuo uentis surgentibus aut freta ponti&
incipiunt agitata tumescere et aridus altis&
montibus audiri fragor, aut resonantia longe&
litora misceri et nemorum increbrescere murmur.
========================================
Let all your rustic folk worship Ceres:
bathe honeycombs with milk and mellow wine,
and thrice around the new crops let the auspicious victim go,
and let each chorus of comrades follow it, rejoicing,
and let them summon Ceres into their houses with a shout;
and let no-one apply his sickle the ripe ears before
the time when he, enwreathed with a twisted oak garland,
performs rough dances and sings songs to Ceres.

And so that we could learn by trusty signs these things -
heat and rains and frost-bearing winds -
our great Father set up what the monthy moon should advise,
with which sign the South Winds should fall,
which farmers, when they see it often,
should keep their herds near the barns.
As soon as the winds rise, either the straits of the sea
begin to swell in agitation and a grating crash is heard
in the tall mountains, or the far resounding shores
are embroiled and the rustling of the forests spreads.
========================================

iam sibi tum a curuis male temperat unda carinis,   &            360
cum medio celeres reuolant ex aequore mergi&
clamoremque ferunt ad litora, cumque marinae&
in sicco ludunt fulicae, notasque paludes&

saepe etiam stellas uento impendente uidebis   &            365
praecipitis caelo labi, noctisque per umbram&
flammarum longos a tergo albescere tractus;&
saepe leuem paleam et frondes uolitare caducas&
aut summa nantis in aqua conludere plumas.&

suspiciens patulis captauit naribus auras,&
aut arguta lacus circumuolitauit hirundo&
et ueterem in limo ranae cecinere querelam.
========================================
Already then the wave behaves badly towards curved keels,
as the swift gulls fly back from the middle of the sea
and bear a clamor to the shore, and as ocean birds
play on dry land, and the heron quits his familiar marshes
and flies high above the clouds.
Yet often, when the wind is threatening, you'll see stars
fall headlong from the sky, and long streams of flames
gleaming through the darkness of the night;
and ofttimes light chaff and fallen leaves hovering overhead
or floating feathers making sport on deep water.
But when lightning strikes from the direction of the fierce North Wind
and when the houses of both the East and West Winds thunder,
farms float with ditches filled to the top
and every sailor on the sea furls soaking sails.
Never did the shower harm the unaware:
either the airborne cranes flee it, rising in the inmost valleys,
or a heifer, looking up into the sky,
tries to catch the breeze with flaring nostrils,
or a melodious swallow flies over lakes
and in the mire the frogs sing their old complaint.
========================================
saepius et tectis penetralibus extulit oua&
angustum formica terens iter, et bibit ingens  &             380

tum cornix plena pluuiam uocat improba uoce&
et sola in sicca secum spatiatur harena.&
ne nocturna quidem carpentes pensa puellae    &           390
nesciuere hiemem, testa cum ardente uiderent&
scintillare oleum et putris concrescere fungos.
========================================
Often, too, the ant carries her eggs out of her inner chambers,
wearing a narrow path, and a huge rainbow draws water,
and, leaving their feeding ground in a great column,
an army of ravens clamors with close-set wings.
Then various sea-birds as well, those that poke around the Asian meadows
in the pleasant pools of Cayster - you'll see them
splashing copious sprays upon each others' shoulders in sport,
now ducking their heads into the sea, now running into the waves,
earnestly, idly eager to bathe.
Then the crow, with a shameless full voice, summons a shower
and promenades by himself on dry sand, alone.
Even the lasses, carding their nightly wool,
aren't unaware of the storm, when in the flaming lamp they see
the oil spark and moldy lamp-black stiffen.
========================================

Nec minus ex imbri soles et aperta serena&
prospicere et certis poteris cognoscere signis:&
nam neque tum stellis acies obtunsa uidetur,  &             395
nec fratris radiis obnoxia surgere Luna,&
tenuia nec lanae per caelum uellera ferri;&
non tepidum ad solem pennas in litore pandunt&
dilectae Thetidi alcyones, non ore solutos&
immundi meminere sues iactare maniplos.  &              400
at nebulae magis ima petunt campoque recumbunt,&
solis et occasum seruans de culmine summo&
nequiquam seros exercet noctua cantus.&
apparet liquido sublimis in aere Nisus,&
et pro purpureo poenas dat Scylla capillo:  &             405
quacumque illa leuem fugiens secat aethera pennis,&
ecce inimicus atrox magno stridore per auras&
insequitur Nisus; qua se fert Nisus ad auras,&
illa leuem fugiens raptim secat aethera pennis.
========================================
Also, after a shower you can forecast fair days and fine weather
and can recognize this from certain signs:
for a blunt edge to the stars doesn't appear then,
nor does the Moon rise, beholden to her brother's beams,
nor are delicate woolen fleeces borne across the sky;
the kingfisher, dear to Thetis, doesn't spread its wings
upon the shore towards sunset, nor do filthy swine
remember to scatter twists of loose hay with their snouts.
But mists seek out the lowest parts and lie upon the plain,
and, watching the setting sun from the roof top,
the owlet practices its late-night songs in vain.
The eagle, Nisus, appears high up in the clear air,
and Scylla pays the price for his purple lock of hair:
she, fleeing any which way, cleaves the smooth sky with her wings,
look, Nisus, hostile, fierce, pursues her with whirring wings
across the winds; wherever Nisus lifts himself on high,
she, in hasty flight, cleaves the smooth sky with her wings.
========================================

tum liquidas corui presso ter gutture uoces  &             410
aut quater ingeminant, et saepe cubilibus altis&
nescio qua praeter solitum dulcedine laeti&

========================================
Then the crows repeat their soft voices in their tensed throats
three or four times, and often in their high lairs in the leaves,
they somehow caw among themselves more than usual
in glad sweetness. When the showers are over they're pleased
to revisit their small progeny and charming nests.
Indeed I scarcely think they have divinely granted wit
or foreknowledge of matters greater than fate;
but when the storms and moisture of the fickle sky have moved ways
and heaven, wet with the South Wind, thickens,
in a way, what was thin and loosens what was dense,
the souls' shapes are changed, and their hearts now
take up other motions than when the wind was driving clouds.
From this comes that singing together of birds in the fields
and happy sheep and crows rejoicing in their throats. 
========================================
Si uero solem ad rapidum lunasque sequentis&

========================================
Indeed, if you watch the twirling sun and the moons following
each other in order, the coming season will never deceive you,
nor will you be taken in by the treachery of a clear night.
As soon as the moon collects her returning fires,
if she grasps a dark mist with her dimly seen horns,
a mighty storm will be prepared for farmers and the sea;
but if her face flushes with a virginal blush,
there'll be wind: Golden Diana always turns red for wind.
But if on her fourth rise (for that's the surest authority)
she goes through the sky pure, with unbruised horns,
both that entire day and those that will rise from it
until the end of the month will be free of rain and wind,
and rescued sailors will fulfill their vows upon the shore
to Glaucus and Panopea and Ino's Melicertes.
Likewise the sun will give you signs, both as it rises and
as it settles into the waves; the surest signs attend the sun,
it bears them both in the morning and when the stars arise.
