Quid faciat laetas segetes, quo sidere terram
uertere, Maecenas, ulmisque adiungere uitis
conueniat, quae cura boum, qui cultus habendo
sit pecori, apibus quanta experientia parcis,
hinc canere incipiam. uos, o clarissima mundi               5
lumina, labentem caelo quae ducitis annum;
Liber et alma Ceres, uestro si munere tellus
Chaoniam pingui glandem mutauit arista,
poculaque inuentis Acheloia miscuit uuis;
et uos, agrestum praesentia numina, Fauni               10
(ferte simul Faunique pedem Dryadesque puellae:
munera uestra cano); tuque o, cui prima frementem
fudit equum magno tellus percussa tridenti,
Neptune; et cultor nemorum, cui pinguia Ceae
ter centum niuei tondent dumeta iuuenci;               15
========================================
From here I'll undertake to sing, Maecenas,
of what produces bountiful crops,
of which star to turn the ground under,
of how to couple vines to elms,
of the care of oxen,
of the labor there is in breeding cattle,
and of how great is the endeavor with thrifty bees.
Oh you, most illustrious lights of the world,
who draw the gliding year along the sky;
Liber and nourishing Ceres,
if by your office the earth changed a Chaonian acorn to a rich grain-ear,
and blended Acheloian draughts with new-found grapes;
and you, Fauns, the present deities of the countrymen,
(beat your feet, both Fauns and Dryad maids together: I sing your offices);
and you, Neptune, for whom the earth poured out the first snorting horse,
after a stroke from your great trident;
you who live in the groves, for whom
three hundred snow-white bullocks graze Cea's abundant thorn-hedges;
========================================
ipse nemus linquens patrium saltusque Lycaei&
Pan, ouium custos, tua si tibi Maenala curae,&
adsis, o Tegeaee, fauens, oleaeque Minerua&
inuentrix, uncique puer monstrator aratri,&
et teneram ab radice ferens, Siluane, cupressum: &              20
dique deaeque omnes, studium quibus arua tueri,&
quique nouas alitis non ullo semine fruges&
quique satis largum caelo demittitis imbrem.&
tuque adeo, quem mox quae sint habitura deorum&
concilia incertum est, urbisne inuisere, Caesar, &              25
terrarumque uelis curam, et te maximus orbis&
auctorem frugum tempestatumque potentem&
accipiat cingens materna tempora myrto;&
an deus immensi uenias maris ac tua nautae&
numina sola colant, tibi seruiat ultima Thule,  &             30
teque sibi generum Tethys emat omnibus undis;
========================================
And you, great Tegean Pam, custodian of sheep,
if you care for your Mount Maenalus,
leave your father's forest and Lycean woodlands and be near at hand,
and also you, Minerva, who created the olive-tree,
and the lad who invented the curved plow,
and Silvanus, carrying a tender cypress by its root:
and all gods and goddesses, who protect the fields with zeal,
both you who rear fresh crops without any seed
and you who let enough plentiful rain fall from the sky.
And even you, Caesar, though it is uncertain,
if the coming councils of the gods will hold you to watch over the cities,
or would you prefer the care of the countryside,
and have the great world accept you as the mighty author of crops and seasons,
girding your mother's brow with myrtle.
Or come as the god of the boundless sea,
and let your presence alone protect the sailor.
May furthest Thule serve you, and may,
by all the billows, Tethys gain you for her son-in-law;
========================================
anne nouum tardis sidus te mensibus addas,&
qua locus Erigonen inter Chelasque sequentis&
panditur (ipse tibi iam bracchia contrahit ardens&
Scorpius et caeli iusta plus parte reliquit);  &             35
quidquid eris (nam te nec sperant Tartara regem,&
nec tibi regnandi ueniat tam dira cupido,&
quamuis Elysios miretur Graecia campos&
nec repetita sequi curet Proserpina matrem),&
da facilem cursum atque audacibus adnue coeptis,    &           40
ignarosque uiae mecum miseratus agrestis&
ingredere et uotis iam nunc adsuesce uocari.&
      Vere nouo, gelidus canis cum montibus umor&
liquitur et Zephyro putris se glaeba resoluit,&
depresso incipiat iam tum mihi taurus aratro   &            45
ingemere et sulco attritus splendescere uomer.
========================================
or might you insert yourself as a new star for the sluggish months,
in the space between Virgo and the Scorpion's claws that spread behind her
(Blazing Scorpio himself now draws his arms in for you
and relinquishes a proper portion of the sky);
whatever you will be (For Hades dares not look for you for their king,
nor should such a dread wish come to you to reign there,
however much Greece might marvel at Elysian fields
nor might fetched-back Proserpina attend to follow her mother.)
give us an easy course and nod at bold undertakings,
and proceed with me, a pitied rustic, men who don't know their way
and get used to soon be summoned with prayers.

In early spring, ice cold water flows from hoary mountains
and a crumbling clod of dirt frees itself through the West Wind,
may my bull soon start to groan with a plow pressed down
and may the plowshare begin to shine, polished by the furrow.
========================================
illa seges demum uotis respondet auari&
agricolae, bis quae solem, bis frigora sensit;&
illius immensae ruperunt horrea messes.&
ac prius ignotum ferro quam scindimus aequor, &              50
uentos et uarium caeli praediscere morem&
cura sit ac patrios cultusque habitusque locorum,&
et quid quaeque ferat regio et quid quaeque recuset.&
hic segetes, illic ueniunt felicius uuae,&
arborei fetus alibi atque iniussa uirescunt  &              55
gramina. nonne uides, croceos ut Tmolus odores,&
India mittit ebur, molles sua tura Sabaei,&
at Chalybes nudi ferrum uirosaque Pontus&
castorea, Eliadum palmas Epiros equarum?
========================================
At last that field answers the greedy farmer's prayers,
after sensing the sun twice, and twice the frosts;
its boundless harvests burst his barns asunder.
But before we cleave the unknown plain with iron,
let our care be first to learn the winds and the varying nature of the sky
and its ancestral cultivation and the conditions of its sites,
and what each region might bear, what it might reject.
Here the grain, there the grapes come more fruitfully,
elsewhere the sapling trees and the grasses turn, unbidden, green.
Don't you see how Tmolus sends saffron perfumes,
India ivory, the gentle men of Saba their frankincense,
naked Chalybians iron, the Pontus rank castor oil,
and Epirus the palms of the mares of Elis.
========================================
continuo has leges aeternaque foedera certis  &             60
imposuit natura locis, quo tempore primum&
Deucalion uacuum lapides iactauit in orbem,&
unde homines nati, durum genus. ergo age, terrae&
pingue solum primis extemplo a mensibus anni&
fortes inuertant tauri, glaebasque iacentis   &            65
puluerulenta coquat maturis solibus aestas;&
at si non fuerit tellus fecunda, sub ipsum&
Arcturum tenui sat erit suspendere sulco:&
illic, officiant laetis ne frugibus herbae,&
hic, sterilem exiguus ne deserat umor harenam. &              70
     Alternis idem tonsas cessare noualis&
et segnem patiere situ durescere campum;&
aut ibi flaua seres mutato sidere farra,&
unde prius laetum siliqua quassante legumen&
aut tenuis fetus uiciae tristisque lupini   &            75
sustuleris fragilis calamos siluamque sonantem.&
urit enim lini campum seges, urit auenae,&
urunt Lethaeo perfusa papauera somno;&
sed tamen alternis facilis labor, arida tantum&
ne saturare fimo pingui pudeat sola neue               80
effetos cinerem immundum iactare per agros.
========================================
Nature imposed the terms of these contracts
on specific places, from the time when first
Deucalion threw stones onto the empty world,
from which a hardy stock of men were born.
So come on, let strong bulls turn over the land's
rich soil right from the first months of the year,
and let the dusty summer heat parch the clods lying in the midsummer sun,
to keep grass from outgrowing the favored crops.
But if the  ground isn't fertile, just as Acturus appears
plow with a somewhat light furrow,
to keep the meager moisture from forsaking the barren sandy soil.

Likewise, let the mowed meadows rest every other year
and the idle field remain in place;
or sow yellow spelt at the change of seasons, there
where you earlier gathered up fruitful beans
with shaking pods or slender fruits of vetch and
brittle reeds and an echoing forest of gloomy lupin.
For a crop of flax dries the field out, as does one of oats,
and poppies bathed in the sleep of Lethe too;
but still every other year makes for easy labor, only
one shouldn't be ashamed to glut parched soils with rich dung
or to throw filthy ashes all through exhausted fields.
========================================
sic quoque mutatis requiescunt fetibus arua,&
nec nulla interea est inaratae gratia terrae.&
saepe etiam sterilis incendere profuit agros&
atque leuem stipulam crepitantibus urere flammis:  &             85
siue inde occultas uiris et pabula terrae&
pinguia concipiunt, siue illis omne per ignem&
excoquitur uitium atque exsudat inutilis umor,&
seu pluris calor ille uias et caeca relaxat&
spiramenta, nouas ueniat qua sucus in herbas, &              90
seu durat magis et uenas astringit hiantis,&
ne tenues pluuiae rapidiue potentia solis&
acrior aut Boreae penetrabile frigus adurat.
========================================
So too changing the crops gives the fields a rest,
nor is the unplowed land ungrateful in the meantime.
It's even often useful to set fire to empty fields
and burn the light stubble with crackling flames:
whether the rich nourishment of the land gets hidden strengths from this
or through this fire each fault boils away
and useless moisture is sweated out,
or maybe that heat loosens more channels and secret pores,
through which the sap may enter the new grasses,
or it might harden and bind the veins gaping wide,
to keep drenching rains or the swift sun's might
or the North Wind's sharper piercing cold from scorching.
========================================
multum adeo, rastris glaebas qui frangit inertis&
uimineasque trahit cratis, iuuat arua, neque illum   &            95
flaua Ceres alto nequiquam spectat Olympo;&
et qui, proscisso quae suscitat aequore terga,&
rursus in obliquum uerso perrumpit aratro&
exercetque frequens tellurem atque imperat aruis.&
      Vmida solstitia atque hiemes orate serenas,   &            100
agricolae; hiberno laetissima puluere farra,&
laetus ager: nullo tantum se Mysia cultu&
iactat et ipsa suas mirantur Gargara messis.&
quid dicam, iacto qui semine comminus arua&
insequitur cumulosque ruit male pinguis harenae,   &            105
deinde satis fluuium inducit riuosque sequentis,&
et, cum exustus ager morientibus aestuat herbis,&
ecce supercilio cliuosi tramitis undam&
elicit? illa cadens raucum per leuia murmur&
saxa ciet, scatebrisque arentia temperat arua.               110
========================================
Indeed, the man who breaks up inert clods of earth with mattocks
and drags wicker harrows assists the soil a great deal,
and not in vain does yellow-haired Ceres watch him from high Olympus;
and he who, after cutting the plain open, lifts up the surfaces,
and turning the plow obliquely breaks through again,
and repeatedly works the earth and commands the plowed fields.

Pray for moist summers and fair winters, farmers;
from winter's dust comes the richest spelt, and a lush field:
with no other cultivation does Mysia boast so much
and Gargara itself marvels at its own harvests.
What can I say?  He who hotly engages the fields after the seed has been cast,
and wickedly crushes the fertile heaps of sand,
then lets running water into what's been planted, and streams after that,
and, when the dried up field burns with dead grass,
look! from the brow of the hilly path he entices water.
This, in falling, drives a hoarse murmur across the smooth stones,
and like a bubbling spring refreshes the parched fields.
========================================
quid qui, ne grauidis procumbat culmus aristis,&
luxuriem segetum tenera depascit in herba,&
cum primum sulcos aequant sata, quique paludis&
collectum umorem bibula deducit harena?&
praesertim incertis si mensibus amnis abundans &              115
exit et obducto late tenet omnia limo,&
unde cauae tepido sudant umore lacunae.&
      Nec tamen, haec cum sint hominumque boumque labores&
uersando terram experti, nihil improbus anser&
Strymoniaeque grues et amaris intiba fibris    &           120
officiunt aut umbra nocet. pater ipse colendi&
haud facilem esse uiam uoluit, primusque per artem&
mouit agros, curis acuens mortalia corda&
nec torpere graui passus sua regna ueterno.&
ante Iouem nulli subigebant arua coloni:    &           125
ne signare quidem aut partiri limite campum&
fas erat; in medium quaerebant, ipsaque tellus&
omnia liberius nullo poscente ferebat.
========================================
And what of he who, for fear the stalk will break under the heavy ears of grain,
grazes out the abundant crop when still tender grass,
just as the crops first come level with the furrows,
and he who diverts the marsh's collected moisture with thirsty sand?
Especially in uncertain months if an overflowing river
rises and holds everything with mud spread far and wide,
from where the empty ditches sweat with warm moisture.

And yet, since these are the toils of both men and oxen,
tested by turning the earth,
no wicked goose or Strymonian cranes or endives with bitter fibers impede,
nor does a shadow do harm.
Our great Father wants no easy path for tilling,
and first disturbs the fields through skill,
whetting mortal minds with cares
and not allowing them to laze with sloth under his weighty reign.
Before Jupiter's time no husbandmen used to plow the fields:
even to mark or divide the fields with a border strip was not just;
they sought for the common good, and the very earth brought all
more freely with no man asking.
