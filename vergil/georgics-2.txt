Hactenus aruorum cultus et sidera caeli;&
nunc te, Bacche, canam, nec non siluestria tecum&
uirgulta et prolem tarde crescentis oliuae.&
huc, pater o Lenaee: tuis hic omnia plena&
muneribus, tibi pampineo grauidus autumno    &           5
floret ager, spumat plenis uindemia labris;&
huc, pater o Lenaee, ueni, nudataque musto&
tinge nouo mecum dereptis crura coturnis.&
      Principio arboribus uaria est natura creandis.&
namque aliae nullis hominum cogentibus ipsae    &           10
sponte sua ueniunt camposque et flumina late&
curua tenent, ut molle siler lentaeque genistae,&
populus et glauca canentia fronde salicta;&
pars autem posito surgunt de semine, ut altae&
castaneae, nemorumque Ioui quae maxima frondet   &            15
aesculus, atque habitae Grais oracula quercus.
========================================
So much for the cultivation of fields and the stars of the sky;
now, Bacchus, I will sing of you, and no less of your wooded brushlands
and the fruit of the slowly growing olive tree.
Here, Father Bacchus: here everything is filled with your gifts,
the laden field abounds for you, covered with harvest vines, 
the grape harvest foams in full vats;
come here, Father Bacchus, and toss away your boots,
and bathe your naked shins with me in the juice of the grape.
     First off, nature is versatile in producing trees.
Indeed, some show up on their own through no agency of men
and take hold of fields and broadly bending rivers,
like the weeping willow and the pliant broom,
poplar and willow groves with silvery foliage;
but some grow from dropped seeds, like the tall chestnuts,
and the Italian oak, the greatest of the groves, leafing out for Jove,
and the oaks held as oracles by the Greeks.
========================================

pullulat ab radice aliis densissima silua,&
ut cerasis ulmisque; etiam Parnasia laurus&
parua sub ingenti matris se subicit umbra.&
hos natura modos primum dedit, his genus omne  &            20
siluarum fruticumque uiret nemorumque sacrorum.&
sunt alii, quos ipse uia sibi repperit usus:&
hic plantas tenero abscindens de corpore matrum&
deposuit sulcis, hic stirpes obruit aruo,&
quadrifidasque sudes et acuto robore uallos.&               25
siluarumque aliae pressos propaginis arcus&
exspectant et uiua sua plantaria terra;&
nil radicis egent aliae summumque putator&
haud dubitat terrae referens mandare cacumen.&
quin et caudicibus sectis (mirabile dictu) &              30
truditur e sicco radix oleagina ligno;&
et saepe alterius ramos impune uidemus&
uertere in alterius, mutatamque insita mala&
ferre pirum et prunis lapidosa rubescere corna.
========================================
With others, like cherry trees and elms,
a dense forest of suckers sprouts from the root:
even Mount Parnassus' laurel, when small,
grows under its mother's vast shadow.
Nature first gave these methods, and through them every sort
of forest and shrub and sacred grove grows green.
There are other methods, that only experience found along the way:
one man, clipping cuttings off their mothers' tender bodies,
planted them in furrows, one man buried stalks in the field,
either with split bases or with pointed ones.
Now some trees in the forest require arches of shoots
and their live cuttings firmly planted in the earth;
while others need no root at all and the gardener doesn't hesitate
to consign the topmost pruning, restoring it to the land.
Indeed, even with its trunk chopped off (What a wonder to tell!)
the olive root sprouts from dry wood;
and we often see that the branches of one tree
turn into another with no harm, and that grafts can
make a pear tree bear apples and stony cornel-cherries redden on plum trees.
========================================

Quare agite o proprios generatim discite cultus,  &             35
agricolae, fructusque feros mollite colendo,&
neu segnes iaceant terrae. iuuat Ismara Baccho&
conserere atque olea magnum uestire Taburnum.&
tuque ades inceptumque una decurre laborem,&
o decus, o famae merito pars maxima nostrae, &              40
Maecenas, pelagoque uolans da uela patenti.&
non ego cuncta meis amplecti uersibus opto,&
non, mihi si linguae centum sint oraque centum,&
ferrea uox. ades et primi lege litoris oram;&
in manibus terrae. non hic te carmine ficto   &            45
atque per ambages et longa exorsa tenebo.
========================================
Come, farmers, and learn about the particular sorts of trees,
and how to civilize wild fruit with cultivation,
lest your lands lie idle. It's a pleasure to sow Mt. Ismarus
with vines and to clothe Mt Taburnus in olive trees.
Maecenas, by whose favor lies the greatest part of my renown,
stand by and speed the undertaking and the toil
and swiftly set sail on the open sea.
I could not wish to encompass it all in my verses,
not if I had a hundred tongues and a hundred mouths, or
a voice of iron.  Attend and skirt the edge of the first shore;
land is at hand.  I'll not hold you here with a contrived song
and through long stories and lengthy beginnings.
========================================

Sponte sua quae se tollunt in luminis oras,&
infecunda quidem, sed laeta et fortia surgunt;&
quippe solo natura subest. tamen haec quoque, si quis&
inserat aut scrobibus mandet mutata subactis,  &             50
exuerint siluestrem animum, cultuque frequenti&
in quascumque uoles artis haud tarda sequentur.&
nec non et, sterilis quae stirpibus exit ab imis,&
hoc faciat, uacuos si sit digesta per agros;&
nunc altae frondes et rami matris opacant   &            55
crescentique adimunt fetus uruntque ferentem.&
iam quae seminibus iactis se sustulit arbos,&
tarda uenit seris factura nepotibus umbram,&
pomaque degenerant sucos oblita priores&
et turpis auibus praedam fert uua racemos.  &             60
scilicet omnibus est labor impendendus, et omnes&
cogendae in sulcum ac multa mercede domandae.&
sed truncis oleae melius, propagine uites&
respondent, solido Paphiae de robore myrtus,&
plantis edurae coryli. nascuntur et ingens&               65
fraxinus Herculeaeque arbos umbrosa coronae,&
Chaoniique patris glandes; etiam ardua palma&
nascitur et casus abies uisura marinos.
========================================
Volunteers that raise themselves into the shore of light,
are surely infertile, but grow luxuriant and vigorous;
of course nature alone is underneath.  Yet these too, if anyone
would graft in or entrust transplants into spade-made ditches,
will lay aside their wild minds and with repeated cultivation
in whatever arts you wish not at all will follow slow.

And not not and, a sterile thing that discharges from its deepest root,
this would do, if might be arranged through empty fields;
now the mother tree's lofty leaves and branches give shade
and those who thrive carry off the offspring and the borne/stolen.

Already which toby seeds cast self raises trees,
the slow work comes/sells with dry shoots >shade,
and forgotten apples are inferior to prior juices 
and the grape bears clusters as spoils for nasty birds.

In fact there is overhanging toil for everyone, and all men
drilling in the furrows and with mastering at great price.

but for the trunks of the better olive trees, vines answer the layer,
the myrtle of Paphia from the solid oak,
from cuttings rock-hard hazel trees.

grow huge and shady ash tree of Hercules' crown,
Chaon's father's acorns; and also towering palm
is born and a fir tree going to be seeing marine falls.
