Hactenus aruorum cultus et sidera caeli;&
nunc te, Bacche, canam, nec non siluestria tecum&
uirgulta et prolem tarde crescentis oliuae.&
huc, pater o Lenaee: tuis hic omnia plena&
muneribus, tibi pampineo grauidus autumno    &           5
floret ager, spumat plenis uindemia labris;&
huc, pater o Lenaee, ueni, nudataque musto&
tinge nouo mecum dereptis crura coturnis.&
      Principio arboribus uaria est natura creandis.&
namque aliae nullis hominum cogentibus ipsae    &           10
sponte sua ueniunt camposque et flumina late&
curua tenent, ut molle siler lentaeque genistae,&
populus et glauca canentia fronde salicta;&
pars autem posito surgunt de semine, ut altae&
castaneae, nemorumque Ioui quae maxima frondet   &            15
aesculus, atque habitae Grais oracula quercus.
========================================
So much for the cultivation of fields and the stars of the sky;
now, Bacchus, I will sing of you, and no less of your wooded brushlands
and the fruit of the slowly growing olive tree.
Here, Father Bacchus: here everything is filled with your gifts,
the laden field abounds for you, covered with harvest vines, 
the grape harvest foams in full vats;
come here, Father Bacchus, and toss away your boots,
and bathe your naked shins with me in the juice of the grape.
     First off, nature is versatile in producing trees.
Indeed, some show up on their own through no agency of men
and take hold of fields and broadly bending rivers,
like the weeping willow and the pliant broom,
poplar and willow groves with silvery foliage;
but some grow from dropped seeds, like the tall chestnuts,
and the Italian oak, the greatest of the groves, leafing out for Jove,
and the oaks held as oracles by the Greeks.
========================================

pullulat ab radice aliis densissima silua,&
ut cerasis ulmisque; etiam Parnasia laurus&
parua sub ingenti matris se subicit umbra.&
hos natura modos primum dedit, his genus omne  &            20
siluarum fruticumque uiret nemorumque sacrorum.&
sunt alii, quos ipse uia sibi repperit usus:&
hic plantas tenero abscindens de corpore matrum&
deposuit sulcis, hic stirpes obruit aruo,&
quadrifidasque sudes et acuto robore uallos.&               25
siluarumque aliae pressos propaginis arcus&
exspectant et uiua sua plantaria terra;&
nil radicis egent aliae summumque putator&
haud dubitat terrae referens mandare cacumen.&
quin et caudicibus sectis (mirabile dictu) &              30
truditur e sicco radix oleagina ligno;&
et saepe alterius ramos impune uidemus&
uertere in alterius, mutatamque insita mala&
ferre pirum et prunis lapidosa rubescere corna.
========================================
The thickest forest sprouts from the root toby others,
like cherry trees and elms: yet the small Parnasian laurel
sets itself under its mother's enormous shadow.
Nature first gave these methods, and through them every sort
of forest and shrub and sacred grove is green.
There are other methods, that experience alone discovered for him on the path:
here, clipping cuttings off of their mothers' tender bodies,
he put down/planted furrows, here he buried plants with the plow,
and >four-sided stakes and with a sharpened oak >posts.
and of forests of another layer >firmly planted/pressed down arches 
and their live cuttings wait for earth;
others need nothing of root and the pruner has no doubts,
restore the highest peak to entrust it to the land.
So that not even toby severed trunks (with a marvellous speech)
is the olive root thrust from dry wood;
and we often see that the branches of one
turns into the other with no damage, and a bad graft
to bring/bear >pear tree and plum tree stony horns to turn red.
