Hactenus aruorum cultus et sidera caeli;&
nunc te, Bacche, canam, nec non siluestria tecum&
uirgulta et prolem tarde crescentis oliuae.&
huc, pater o Lenaee: tuis hic omnia plena&
muneribus, tibi pampineo grauidus autumno    &           5
floret ager, spumat plenis uindemia labris;&
huc, pater o Lenaee, ueni, nudataque musto&
tinge nouo mecum dereptis crura coturnis.&
      Principio arboribus uaria est natura creandis.&
namque aliae nullis hominum cogentibus ipsae    &           10
sponte sua ueniunt camposque et flumina late&
curua tenent, ut molle siler lentaeque genistae,&
populus et glauca canentia fronde salicta;&
pars autem posito surgunt de semine, ut altae&
castaneae, nemorumque Ioui quae maxima frondet   &            15
aesculus, atque habitae Grais oracula quercus.
========================================
So much for the cultivation of fields and the stars of the sky;
now, Bacchus, I will sing of you, and no less of your wooded brushlands
and the fruit of the slowly growing olive tree.
Here, Father Bacchus: here everything is filled with your gifts,
the laden field abounds for you, covered with harvest vines, 
the grape harvest foams in full bowls;
come here, Father Bacchus, and toss away your boots,
and bathe your naked shins with me in the juice of the grape.
     First off, nature is versatile in producing trees.
Indeed, some show up on their own through no agency of men
and take hold of fields and broadly bending rivers,
like the weeping willow and the pliant broom,
poplar and willow groves with grayish-blue foliage;
but some grow from dropped seeds, like the tall chestnuts,
and the Italian oak, the greatest of Jove's groves, leafing out,
and the oaks held as oracles by the Greeks.
