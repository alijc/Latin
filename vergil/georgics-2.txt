========================================
So much for the cultivation of fields and the stars of the sky;
now, Bacchus, I will sing of you, and no less of your wooded brushlands
and the fruit of the slowly growing olive tree.
Here, Father Bacchus: here everything is filled with your gifts,
the laden field abounds for you, covered with harvest vines, 
the grape harvest foams in full vats;
come here, Father Bacchus, and toss away your boots,
and bathe your naked shins with me in the juice of the grape.
     First off, nature is versatile in producing trees.
Indeed, some show up on their own through no agency of men
and take hold of fields and broadly bending rivers,
like the weeping willow and the pliant broom,
poplar and willow groves with silvery foliage;
but some grow from dropped seeds, like the tall chestnuts,
and the Italian oak, the greatest of the groves, leafing out for Jove,
and the oaks held as oracles by the Greeks.
========================================

pullulat ab radice aliis densissima silua,&
ut cerasis ulmisque; etiam Parnasia laurus&
parua sub ingenti matris se subicit umbra.&
hos natura modos primum dedit, his genus omne  &            20

quadrifidasque sudes et acuto robore uallos.&               25

haud dubitat terrae referens mandare cacumen.&

et saepe alterius ramos impune uidemus&
uertere in alterius, mutatamque insita mala&
ferre pirum et prunis lapidosa rubescere corna.
========================================
With others, like cherry trees and elms,
a dense forest of suckers sprouts from the root:
even Mount Parnassus' laurel, when small,
grows under its mother's vast shadow.
Nature first gave these methods, and through them every sort
of forest and shrub and sacred grove grows green.
There are other methods, that only experience found along the way:
one man, clipping cuttings off their mothers' tender bodies,
planted them in furrows, one man buried stalks in the field,
either with split bases or with pointed ones.
Now some trees in the forest require arches of shoots
and their live cuttings firmly planted in the earth;
while others need no root at all and the gardener doesn't hesitate
to consign the topmost pruning, restoring it to the land.
Indeed, even with its trunk chopped off (What a wonder to tell!)
the olive root sprouts from dry wood;
and we often see that the branches of one tree
turn into another with no harm, and that grafts can
make a pear tree bear apples and stony cornel-cherries redden on plum trees.
========================================

Quare agite o proprios generatim discite cultus,  &             35

========================================
Come, farmers, and learn about the particular sorts of trees,
and how to civilize wild fruit with cultivation,
lest your lands lie idle. It's a pleasure to sow Mt. Ismarus
with vines and to clothe Mt Taburnus in olive trees.
Maecenas, by whose favor lies the greatest part of my renown,
stand by and speed the undertaking and the toil
and swiftly set sail on the open sea.
I could not wish to encompass it all in my verses,
not if I had a hundred tongues and a hundred mouths, or
a voice of iron.  Attend and skirt the edge of the first shore;
land is at hand.  I'll not hold you here with a contrived song
and through long stories and lengthy beginnings.
========================================

========================================
Volunteers that raise themselves into the light
are surely unfruitful, but grow luxuriantly and vigorously;
for nature lies hidden in the soil.  Yet even these, if someone
were to graft them or transplant them to spaded ditches,
will lay aside their forest souls and with repeated cultivation
won't be the slightest slow in taking to whichever skills you wish.
And not only this, but a barren tree that rises from the deepest root
would do the same, if it were set out in an empty field;
its mother tree's lofty leaves and branches shade it now,
sap its young of growth and scorch what it's borne.
Already, having cast its seeds, the tree raises itself,
slowly creating shade, comes to its late-blooming offspring,
and fruit decline, forgetting their prior flavor,
and the grape bears foul clusters, spoils for the birds.
In fact there is weighty toil for everyone, and every man
drilling in the trenches and vanquishing at great cost.
But olive trees give a better yield from trunks, vines from slips,
Paphian myrtle from solid hardwood,
and hardy hazel trees from cuttings.
Both the huge ash and the shade tree of Hercules' chaplet,
and the acorns of Chaon's father; and also the towering palm
springs forth and the fir tree that will see catastrophes at sea.
========================================

========================================
Indeed, the rough arbutus is grafted with a walnut sucker,
and barren plane-trees have borne healthy apple-trees,
and chestnuts-trees beech trees; and ash-trees turned hoary with white
pear blossoms and swine crushed acorns under elm-trees.

Nor is there just one way to graft or implant buds.
For where buds are pushing themselves out from within the bark,
and breaking the delicate membranes, a narrow fold might
be made in a knot in that place; here they inset a sprout
from some other tree and teach it to grow in the sap of the inner bark.
On the other hand, smooth trunks are trimmed back, and up high
a path is split into solid wood with wedges, then fertile
cuttings are inserted: and not long after
a huge tree rises towards the sky with fruiting branches,
and marvels at new leaves and fruit that's not its own.
========================================

Praeterea genus haud unum nec fortibus ulmis&
nec salici lotoque neque Idaeis cyparissis,&
nec pingues unam in faciem nascuntur oliuae, &              85

pomaque et Alcinoi siluae, nec surculus idem&
Crustumiis Syriisque piris grauibusque uolemis.&

argitisque minor, cui non certauerit ulla&
aut tantum fluere aut totidem durare per annos.               100
========================================
Moreover, there is not a single sort, either of mightly elms
or willows or hackberry-trees or the cypresses of Mt Ida,
nor do oil-laden olives spring up in a single form,
Orchas and Radius and bitter Pausea olives,
and Alcinoian fruit orchards, and the same scion is not used
for Crustumarian and Syrian pears and larger heavier ones.
The same vintage doesn't hang from our trees 
as what Lesbos plucks from the Mithymnan vine;
there are Thasian vines, and others in white Mareotico,
the former suited to lighter soils, the latter to fertile ones,
and Psithian vines more meet for raisin wine, and thin Lageos wine
that will touch the feet and soon wind around the tongue,
Purpureae and Preciae and, how shall I sing your praise, Rhaetica?
Therefore, don't contend with Falernian cellars.
And there are Aminean vines, the strongest wines,
Tmolius yields the palm to them and King Phanaeus himself,
and Argitis Minor, with which none may contend
either to flow so much or to last so long across the years.
========================================

non ego te, dis et mensis accepta secundis,&

========================================
Nor should I pass you over, vine of Rhodes,
accepted by the gods and at dinner's second course,
nor Burmastus, with your swelling clusters of grapes.
But how many species or what their names might be is beyond number,
nor indeed does it bear to lump them in a number;
whoever would wish to know it, might as well wish to tell
how many grains of Libyan sand are disturbed by the West Wind
or, when the violent East Wind falls upon ships,
to know how many waves might crash upon the Ionian shores.

Nor indeed can all lands bear all things.
Willows grow by rivers and alders in rough marshes,
barren ash-trees in rocky mountains;
the coast is favorable to myrtles groves;
finally Bacchus loves open hilltops,
a yew-tree the North Wind and cold weather.
And look at the regions mastered by foreign husbandmen -
the Eastern homes of Arabs and the painted Geloni:
their native lands distinguished by their trees.
India alone bears black ebony, only in Saba is there frankincense.
========================================

========================================
What can I tell you of balsam oozing from
its scented wood or the evergreen acacia's berries?
What of Ethiopean forests covered in soft white down,
or how the Chinese comb fine silk off of leaves?
Or the groves that India is clothed in, next to Ocean,
a nook on the edge of the world, where no arrows
could possibly overshoot the treetops? -
and indeed that race is not lazy when they take up their quivers.
The citron bears bitter juices and a lingering taste
in its blessed fruit.  Nothing is handier,
if ever your cruel stepmother were to poison your cup,
with a mix of herbs and noxious words,
succor comes and drives deadly poisons from the limbs.
========================================

ipsa ingens arbos faciemque simillima lauro,&
et, si non alium late iactaret odorem,&

      Sed neque Medorum siluae, ditissima terra,&

nec galeis densisque uirum seges horruit hastis;&
sed grauidae fruges et Bacchi Massicus umor&
impleuere; tenent oleae armentaque laeta.
========================================
That immense tree has a form most like a laurel,
and, if it didn't broadly emit a different scent,
would be a laurel: its leaves barely move in any breeze,
and its flower is especially tenacious; the Medians use it
to treat their breath and stinking mouths and the wheezing of old men.

But neither the forests of Medians, the richest land,
nor the beautiful Ganges or the Hermus, clouded with gold,
can match the glories of Italy, not Bactra nor the Indies
nor all Arabia with its fertile incense-yielding sands.
Fire-breathing bulls have not plowed up these regions,
a sea-serpent's immense teeth were not sown,
nor did a crop of troops bristle with close-packed helms and spears;
but swelling harvests and Bacchus' Massic wine have filled them:
olive trees and happy herds endure.
========================================

========================================
From here the war-horse carries itself proudly erect upon the plain,
from here white flocks and a bull, the greatest sacrifice,
that often bathed in your sacred river, Clitumus,
have led Roman triumphs to the temples of the gods.
Here is constant spring, and summer, in another season's months:
twice do the sheep bear young, twice the tree bears useful fruit.
And wild tigers and the savage race of lions are not found,
nor does wolfbane dupe unfortune gatherers,
nor does the scaly serpent drag its massive train across the land
or gather itself into a coil.
Add so many eminent cities and works of fortification,
so many towns heaped up by hand on steep rocks
and rivers gliding beneath ancient walls.
Or should I call to mind the sea, that washes those above, and those below?
========================================

========================================
Should I not speak of lakes so great? You, great Larius, and you,
Benacus, surging with crashing waves like a sea?
Should I call to mind the harbors and the dikes added to Lucrinus
and the hissing sea chafing at it,
as the Julian harbor's waves resound far and wide
beaten back by the sea
and the Tyrrhenian swell is forced from the straits of Avernus?
It reveals streams of silver and copper - these greatest mines -
it flows in veins of gold.
This has brought out a zealous, powerful race, Marsians and Sabines,
and Ligurians, accustomed to hardship, and javelin wielding Volscians,
the Decii, the Marii, and the great Camillii,
Scipios, stern in war and you, greatest Caesar,
who, already victorious on the outmost shores of Asia,
now routs unwarlike India from the hills of Rome.
========================================

========================================
Hail, land of Saturn, great mother of crops, and of men:
for you I undertake the acts and art of ancient praise,
to boldly open up the sacred springs,
and sing a rustic song through Roman towns.

Now for the qualities of a field's site, what strengths each might have,
what color and what nature for bearing crops.
First off, troublesome lands and barren hills,
where there is scant clay and gravel in thorn-filled fields,
delight in Athena's grove of long-lived olive trees.
You'll notice oleasters standing in such a place
and most of the field strewn with woodland berries.
But any rich soil with blessed sweet moisture,
and every fertile plain crowded with lush grass,
the kind that we often look down at from a mountain dell
(the rivers flow down to it from the highest rocks,
bearing fertile silt), each one is lifted to the South Wind
and nourishes bracken that has never seen the plow:
========================================

hic tibi praeualidas olim multoque fluentis  &             190
sufficiet Baccho uitis, hic fertilis uuae,&
hic laticis, qualem pateris libamus et auro,&
inflauit cum pinguis ebur Tyrrhenus ad aras,&
lancibus et pandis fumantia reddimus exta.&
sin armenta magis studium uitulosque tueri      &         195
aut ouium fetum aut urentis culta capellas,&
saltus et saturi petito longinqua Tarenti,&
et qualem infelix amisit Mantua campum&
pascentem niueos herboso flumine cycnos:&
non liquidi gregibus fontes, non gramina deerunt,  &             200
et quantum longis carpent armenta diebus&
exigua tantum gelidus ros nocte reponet.&
nigra fere et presso pinguis sub uomere terra&
et cui putre solum (namque hoc imitamur arando),&
optima frumentis: non ullo ex aequore cernes   &            205
plura domum tardis decedere plaustra iuuencis;
========================================
One day there'll be strong-growing vines for you here,
fertile grapes here, flowing wine here,
enough for streams of great Bacchus
for the libations we pour out from golden bowls
as Tyrrhenus plays his ivory shell by fat-filled altars
and we present the reeking entrails on curved platters.
But if you're more eager to care for cattle and calves
or lambs or goats that parch cultivated land,
look for the woodland pastures of distant fertile Tarentum
or the sort of plain that unfortunate Mantua lost,
that nourishes snow-white swans along its grass-lined stream:
there neither clear springs or grasses are lacking for flocks,
and however much the herds browse during the long days,
the ice-cold dew will restore it in the short night.
Fertile earth, nearly black where the plowshare digs into it,
the crumbly soil (for we imitate this in plowing),
that's best for grain: from no other field will you will observe
more ox-drawn carts plodding their way homeward;
========================================

aut unde iratus siluam deuexit arator&
et nemora euertit multos ignaua per annos,&
antiquasque domos auium cum stirpibus imis&
eruit; illae altum nidis petiere relictis,  &             210
at rudis enituit impulso uomere campus.&
nam ieiuna quidem cliuosi glarea ruris&
uix humilis apibus casias roremque ministrat;&
et tofus scaber et nigris exesa chelydris&
creta negant alios aeque serpentibus agros &              215
dulcem ferre cibum et curuas praebere latebras.&
quae tenuem exhalat nebulam fumosque uolucris,&
et bibit umorem et, cum uult, ex se ipsa remittit,&
quaeque suo semper uiridi se gramine uestit&
nec scabie et salsa laedit robigine ferrum,   &            220
illa tibi laetis intexet uitibus ulmos,&
illa ferax oleo est, illam experiere colendo&
et facilem pecori et patientem uomeris unci.&
talem diues arat Capua et uicina Vesaeuo&
ora iugo et uacuis Clanius non aequus Acerris.               225
========================================
Or from where the angry plowman carted off the forest
and uprooted useless woods, and plucked the ancient,
years-old, homes of birds from their deepest roots;
from their abandoned nests those birds shoot for the heights,
while the rough plain gleams under the force of the plowshare.
For indeed the hilly country's barren gravel
barely services the bees with humble casias and rosemary;
and the rough tufa and the chalk eaten by black water-snakes
say that no other fields so well supply 
sweet fare or arched lairs for serpents.
And that which breathes out thin mist and wispy steam,
and drinks moisture in and casts it back at will,
that clothes itself in its own grass, ever green,
nor does it damage iron with filth and salty rust,
that earth will plait elms for you with gay vines,
it is fruitful with oil, and you will find cultivation
both easy for cattle and patient of the curved plowshare.
Capua plows such richness and the shore near Mt Vesuvius
and the Clanius River too, but not the plain at worthless Acerrae.
========================================

Nunc quo quamque modo possis cognoscere dicam.&
rara sit an supra morem si densa requires&
(altera frumentis quoniam fauet, altera Baccho,&
densa magis Cereri, rarissima quaeque Lyaeo),&

spissus ager: glaebas cunctantis crassaque terga&
exspecta et ualidis terram proscinde iuuencis.
========================================
Now I'll tell you how to recognize what sort each is.
whether you need it to be loose or denser than the norm
(because one favors grain, and the other vines,
denser earth for Ceres, whichever is loosest for Dionysos).
First you'll size up the spot, and order a pit
to be dug deep in the solid ground, then shove all the soil
back in again and trample the high bits down.
If it falls short, then it's loose, better soil
for nourishing cattle and vines; but if the earth can't be
put back in place, but rises up and overfills the pit,
it's dense soil: expect clinging clods and an uneven surface
and plow the virgin land with strong young bulls.
========================================

========================================
But salty soil and the stuff that's called 'bitter'
(it's not good for crops, nor is it tamed by tilling
for vines or fruit trees and its stock doesn't protect its own name)
such a thing will give the proof.  Pull basket strainers down
from your smoky rafters, the ones made from thick shoots;
here let that evil dirt and sweet spring water
be stomped down until the strainer fills: the water will be forced through,
you see, and great drops will pass between the twigs;
but the unmistakable taste will give you proof and
will twist the sorry mouths of the tasters with bitterness.
Likewise, we learn if the earth is fertile, in this one last way:
not ever, when thrown from the hands, does it crack open,
but becomes sticky, like pitch, hanging on to your fingers.
========================================

========================================
Moist earth nourishes taller stalks, and is, in truth, too rich.
Ah, let that earth not be overly fertile,
or grow too much in its first budding ears!
Some is heavy, silently laying weight on itself, and some is light.
It's easy to instantly recognize black earth with your eyes,
and which is what color.  But to ferret out accursed cold soil is hard:
only spruces and sometimes noxious yews or black ivy expose its traces.

Having tended to these things, remember to dry out the earth and destroy
great hillocks with ditches much earlier, 
before the clods have been turned up and exposed to the North Wind;
then you can plant a fertile breed of vine.  The best fields
have crumbly soil: winds and cold frosts see to it,
and the hardy spademan disturbing the loosened acres.

========================================
But if anyone has done their due diligence,
they first seek out a place like where the crop now appears on trees
and from where they could then carry and spread it,
lest the seeds be shocked by the unexpectedly strange earth.
Moreover, they mark the region of the sky in the bark,
to restore whichever way each stood before, which side will
bear the the brunt of the south wind's heat,
and which will be backed up towards the North:
well used to just what it had in its tender years.
First off, figure out whether to put your vines on land that's hilly or flat.
If you measure off fertile fields on a plain,
sow them thickly (Bacchus is no less prolific closer together);
but if on hills, with a steep or gentle slope, set wide rows;
and with each lane no less squared up, to a hair,
on a track with the trees that were planted:
as often in an immense war a extended legion stretches out its cohorts
and a column makes a stand on the open plain,
with the lines formed up and all the wide earth wavering 
in the glistening air, but the battle hasn't yet joined,
and armed Mars wanders, in uncertainity, between the lines.
Let all measurements be in equal numbers of the roads,
not only for the prospect to feed the empty mind,
but since the land won't otherwise give calm to all men,
nor will the branches be able to extend themselves in a void.
