Hactenus aruorum cultus et sidera caeli;&
nunc te, Bacche, canam, nec non siluestria tecum&
uirgulta et prolem tarde crescentis oliuae.&
huc, pater o Lenaee: tuis hic omnia plena&
muneribus, tibi pampineo grauidus autumno    &           5
floret ager, spumat plenis uindemia labris;&
huc, pater o Lenaee, ueni, nudataque musto&
tinge nouo mecum dereptis crura coturnis.&
      Principio arboribus uaria est natura creandis.&
namque aliae nullis hominum cogentibus ipsae    &           10
sponte sua ueniunt camposque et flumina late&
curua tenent, ut molle siler lentaeque genistae,&
populus et glauca canentia fronde salicta;&
pars autem posito surgunt de semine, ut altae&
castaneae, nemorumque Ioui quae maxima frondet   &            15
aesculus, atque habitae Grais oracula quercus.
========================================
So much for the cultivation of fields and the stars of the sky;
now, Bacchus, I will sing of you, and no less of your wooded brushlands
and the fruit of the slowly growing olive tree.
Here, Father Bacchus: here everything is filled with your gifts,
the laden field abounds for you, covered with harvest vines, 
the grape harvest foams in full vats;
come here, Father Bacchus, and toss away your boots,
and bathe your naked shins with me in the juice of the grape.
     First off, nature is versatile in producing trees.
Indeed, some show up on their own through no agency of men
and take hold of fields and broadly bending rivers,
like the weeping willow and the pliant broom,
poplar and willow groves with silvery foliage;
but some grow from dropped seeds, like the tall chestnuts,
and the Italian oak, the greatest of the groves, leafing out for Jove,
and the oaks held as oracles by the Greeks.
========================================

pullulat ab radice aliis densissima silua,&
ut cerasis ulmisque; etiam Parnasia laurus&
parua sub ingenti matris se subicit umbra.&
hos natura modos primum dedit, his genus omne  &            20
siluarum fruticumque uiret nemorumque sacrorum.&
sunt alii, quos ipse uia sibi repperit usus:&
hic plantas tenero abscindens de corpore matrum&
deposuit sulcis, hic stirpes obruit aruo,&
quadrifidasque sudes et acuto robore uallos.&               25
siluarumque aliae pressos propaginis arcus&
exspectant et uiua sua plantaria terra;&
nil radicis egent aliae summumque putator&
haud dubitat terrae referens mandare cacumen.&
quin et caudicibus sectis (mirabile dictu) &              30
truditur e sicco radix oleagina ligno;&
et saepe alterius ramos impune uidemus&
uertere in alterius, mutatamque insita mala&
ferre pirum et prunis lapidosa rubescere corna.
========================================
With others, like cherry trees and elms,
a dense forest of suckers sprouts from the root:
even Mount Parnassus' laurel, when small,
grows under its mother's vast shadow.
Nature first gave these methods, and through them every sort
of forest and shrub and sacred grove grows green.
There are other methods, that only experience found along the way:
one man, clipping cuttings off their mothers' tender bodies,
planted them in furrows, one man buried stalks in the field,
either with split bases or with pointed ones.
Now some trees in the forest require arches of shoots
and their live cuttings firmly planted in the earth;
while others need no root at all and the gardener doesn't hesitate
to consign the topmost pruning, restoring it to the land.
Indeed, even with its trunk chopped off (What a wonder to tell!)
the olive root sprouts from dry wood;
and we often see that the branches of one tree
turn into another with no harm, and that grafts can
make a pear tree bear apples and stony cornel-cherries redden on plum trees.
========================================

Quare agite o proprios generatim discite cultus,  &             35
agricolae, fructusque feros mollite colendo,&
neu segnes iaceant terrae. iuuat Ismara Baccho&

atque per ambages et longa exorsa tenebo.
========================================
Come, farmers, and learn about the particular sorts of trees,
and how to civilize wild fruit with cultivation,
lest your lands lie idle. It's a pleasure to sow Mt. Ismarus
with vines and to clothe Mt Taburnus in olive trees.
Maecenas, by whose favor lies the greatest part of my renown,
stand by and speed the undertaking and the toil
and swiftly set sail on the open sea.
I could not wish to encompass it all in my verses,
not if I had a hundred tongues and a hundred mouths, or
a voice of iron.  Attend and skirt the edge of the first shore;
land is at hand.  I'll not hold you here with a contrived song
and through long stories and lengthy beginnings.
========================================

Sponte sua quae se tollunt in luminis oras,&

========================================
Volunteers that raise themselves into the light
are surely unfruitful, but grow luxuriantly and vigorously;
for nature lies hidden in the soil.  Yet even these, if someone
were to graft them or transplant them to spaded ditches,
will lay aside their forest souls and with repeated cultivation
won't be the slightest slow in taking to whichever skills you wish.
And not only this, but a barren tree that rises from the deepest root
would do the same, if it were set out in an empty field;
its mother tree's lofty leaves and branches shade it now,
sap its young of growth and scorch what it's borne.
Already, having cast its seeds, the tree raises itself,
slowly creating shade, comes to its late-blooming offspring,
and fruit decline, forgetting their prior flavor,
and the grape bears foul clusters, spoils for the birds.
In fact there is weighty toil for everyone, and every man
drilling in the trenches and vanquishing at great cost.
But olive trees give a better yield from trunks, vines from slips,
Paphian myrtle from solid hardwood,
and hardy hazel trees from cuttings.
Both the huge ash and the shade tree of Hercules' chaplet,
and the acorns of Chaon's father; and also the towering palm
springs forth and the fir tree that will see catastrophes at sea.
========================================

inseritur uero et fetu nucis arbutus horrida,&

      Nec modus inserere atque oculos imponere simplex.&

miratastque[miraturque] nouas frondes et non sua poma.
========================================
Indeed, the bristly arbutus is grafted and bears walnuts for its fruit,
and barren plane-trees healthy apple-trees,
and chestnuts-trees beech trees; and ash-trees turn hoary with white
pear blossoms and swine crush acorns under elm-trees.

Neither is there a single way to plant or to implant buds.
For where buds force themselves out from the center (layer?) of bark,
and they break delicate tunics, narrow in himself
the bowl/curve might be in knot/node; here they inset a sprout
from a different tree and teach it to grow in the inner bark.
On the other hand, smooth trunks are trimmed back, and up high
a path is split into solid wood with wedges, then fertile
cuttings are inserted: and not long time, and
a huge tree rises towards the sky with fruiting branches,
and marvels at new leaves and fruit that's not its own.
