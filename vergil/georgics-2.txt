Hactenus aruorum cultus et sidera caeli;&
nunc te, Bacche, canam, nec non siluestria tecum&
uirgulta et prolem tarde crescentis oliuae.&
huc, pater o Lenaee: tuis hic omnia plena&
muneribus, tibi pampineo grauidus autumno    &           5
floret ager, spumat plenis uindemia labris;&
huc, pater o Lenaee, ueni, nudataque musto&
tinge nouo mecum dereptis crura coturnis.&
      Principio arboribus uaria est natura creandis.&
namque aliae nullis hominum cogentibus ipsae    &           10
sponte sua ueniunt camposque et flumina late&
curua tenent, ut molle siler lentaeque genistae,&
populus et glauca canentia fronde salicta;&
pars autem posito surgunt de semine, ut altae&
castaneae, nemorumque Ioui quae maxima frondet   &            15
aesculus, atque habitae Grais oracula quercus.
========================================
So much for the cultivation of fields and the stars of the sky;
now, Bacchus, I will sing of you, and no less of your wooded brushlands
and the fruit of the slowly growing olive tree.
Here, Father Bacchus: here everything is filled with your gifts,
the laden field abounds for you, covered with harvest vines, 
the grape harvest foams in full vats;
come here, Father Bacchus, and toss away your boots,
and bathe your naked shins with me in the juice of the grape.
     First off, nature is versatile in producing trees.
Indeed, some show up on their own through no agency of men
and take hold of fields and broadly bending rivers,
like the weeping willow and the pliant broom,
poplar and willow groves with silvery foliage;
but some grow from dropped seeds, like the tall chestnuts,
and the Italian oak, the greatest of the groves, leafing out for Jove,
and the oaks held as oracles by the Greeks.
========================================

pullulat ab radice aliis densissima silua,&
ut cerasis ulmisque; etiam Parnasia laurus&
parua sub ingenti matris se subicit umbra.&
hos natura modos primum dedit, his genus omne  &            20
siluarum fruticumque uiret nemorumque sacrorum.&
sunt alii, quos ipse uia sibi repperit usus:&
hic plantas tenero abscindens de corpore matrum&
deposuit sulcis, hic stirpes obruit aruo,&
quadrifidasque sudes et acuto robore uallos.&               25
siluarumque aliae pressos propaginis arcus&
exspectant et uiua sua plantaria terra;&
nil radicis egent aliae summumque putator&
haud dubitat terrae referens mandare cacumen.&
quin et caudicibus sectis (mirabile dictu) &              30
truditur e sicco radix oleagina ligno;&
et saepe alterius ramos impune uidemus&
uertere in alterius, mutatamque insita mala&
ferre pirum et prunis lapidosa rubescere corna.
========================================
With some, like cherry trees and elms,
the densest forest sprouts suckers from its root:
yet the small Parnasian laurel
sets itself under its mother's vast shadow.
Nature first gave these methods, and through them every sort
of forest and shrub and sacred grove grows green.
There are other methods, that experience alone found for itself on the way:
here, clipping cuttings off of their mothers' tender bodies,
it planted them in furrows, here it covered shoots over in the field,
both square-cut stakes and ones of sharpened oak.
Now some trees in the forest require arches of shoots firmly planted
and their live cuttings in the earth;
while others need no root at all and the gardener doesn't hesitate
to consign the topmost pruning, restoring it to the land.
So that even with its trunk chopped off (What a wonder to tell!)
the olive root sprouts from dry wood;
and we often see that the branches of one tree
turns into another with no harm, and that grafts can
make a pear tree bear apples and stony cornel-cherries to redden on plum trees.
