Te quoque, magna Pales, et te memorande canemus
pastor ab Amphryso, uos, siluae amnesque Lycaei.
cetera, quae uacuas tenuissent carmine mentes,
omnia iam uulgata: quis aut Eurysthea durum
aut inlaudati nescit Busiridis aras?               5
cui non dictus Hylas puer et Latonia Delos
Hippodameque umeroque Pelops insignis eburno,
acer equis? temptanda uia est, qua me quoque possim
tollere humo uictorque uirum uolitare per ora.
primus ego in patriam mecum, modo uita supersit,               10
Aonio rediens deducam uertice Musas
primus Idumaeas referam tibi, Mantua, palmas,
et uiridi in campo templum de marmore ponam
propter aquam, tardis ingens ubi flexibus errat
Mincius et tenera praetexit harundine ripas.               15
========================================
We'll also sing of you, great Pales, and you, Amphrysian shepherd,
and you, Lycaean woods and rivers. 
All other strains, that used to occupy vacant minds,
are now quite common: who doesn't know of stern Eurystheus
or detestable Busiris' altars.
Who has not heard of the boy Hylas, or Latona's Delos
or Hippodame or Pelops, marked by his ivory shoulder,
that keen charioteer.
A way must needs be found for me too to lift myself
from the ground and fly, victorious, above men's faces. 
first I'll take the Muses home with me, so long as life suffice,
returning from the top of Aonius;
first I'll return the Idumaean palms to you, Mantua,
and erect a marble temple on the green plain near the water,
where the Mincius wanders in slow turnings and weaves its banks in tender reeds.
========================================

in medio mihi Caesar erit templumque tenebit:
illi uictor ego et Tyrio conspectus in ostro
centum quadriiugos agitabo ad flumina currus.
cuncta mihi Alpheum linquens lucosque Molorchi
cursibus et crudo decernet Graecia caestu.               20
ipse caput tonsae foliis ornatus oliuae
dona feram. iam nunc sollemnis ducere pompas
ad delubra iuuat caesosque uidere iuuencos,
uel scaena ut uersis discedat frontibus utque
purpurea intexti tollant aulaea Britanni.               25
in foribus pugnam ex auro solidoque elephanto
Gangaridum faciam uictorisque arma Quirini,
atque hic undantem bello magnumque fluentem
Nilum ac nauali surgentis aere columnas.
addam urbes Asiae domitas pulsumque Niphaten               30
fidentemque fuga Parthum uersisque sagittis;
et duo rapta manu diuerso ex hoste tropaea
bisque triumphatas utroque ab litore gentis.
========================================
Within my temple Caesar will dwell and will be master:
for him I, triumphant and viewed in Tyrian purple,
will drive a hundred four-horse chariots up along the river.
All of Greece, forsaking the Alpheus and Molorchus' sacred groves for me,
will contend in races and with the rawhide boxing glove.
I myself will bear the prizes, my head adorned with olive leaves.
Already now I'm pleased to lead the solemn processions
to the shrines and to see the slaughtered bullocks,
whether the stage shifts with revolving faces,
or the embroidered Britons rise with the purple curtains.
On the doors I'll depict a battle out of solid gold and ivory -
the Ganges-dwellers and the arms of the Roman victor,
and here the great surging Nile, flowing warlike,
and towering columns, topped with naval bronze.
I'll add the conquered cities of Asia and the routed Niphates
and the Parthian, trusting in flight and in backward-flying arrows;
and two trophies seized from the hands of different enemies
and twice triumphant nations from each end of the sea.
========================================

========================================
And the marble statues will stand, breathing images,
the progeny of Assaracus and the great names of Jove's descendents,
and Troy's father, Tros, and founder, Cynthius.
Wretched envy will stand in fear of the Furies
and the harsh river of Cocytus and Ixion's snakes,
and the monstrous wheel and Sisyphus' unsurmountable stone.
Meanwhile, let us range over the wood-nymphs' woods and virgin passes,
observing your, Maecenas, by no means gentle commands:
without you the mind begins no lofty thing.  Come on!
tear down what slows you down; Mt Cithaeron calls with a huge clamor
and Taygetian dogs and Epidaurus, the tamer of horses,
and, redoubled in assent, the forests' voice bellows back.
Yet presently I'll gird myself to tell of Caesar's blazing battles
and bear his name in fame through as many years
as there are from the birth of Tithonus to Caesar.
========================================

========================================
Whether one raises horses in hopes of prizes of the Olympian palm,
or perhaps bullocks for the plow,
let him be particular in chosing the dams.  The best looking cow
has a grim face, an ugly head and a huge neck,
and dewlaps hanging from her chin down to her shanks;
with no end to the length of her flanks: everything large,
even her feet, and shaggy ears under inward-curving horns.
And I'd not be displeased by conspicuous white spots,
or recoiling from the yoke or a sometimes violent horn
and a face more like a bull's, and totally tall
and in her walk her tail sweeps the bottom of the track.
The age to allow for proper mating and for birth
starts after four years and ends before ten;
outside of that she's neither fit to breed nor strong enough to plow.
Meanwhile, while cheerful youth is left to the herds
set the males loose; first off, send the herds to venery,
and provide one generation after another for breeding.

========================================
Whichever day is best is always the first to flee from mortal wretches;
illnesses and sad old age and suffering draw near,
and the harshness of cruel death rushes in.
There will always be those whose bodies have changed for the worse:
always change them out, above all come to choose the offspring for the herd
each year, lest you afterwards miss what has been lost.

And too, it's the same choice for a herd of horses:
if only you choose them in hopes of rearing a good line,
expend particular labor on them from the time they're young.
From his first steps a well-bred foal walks more erectly
in the fields and bends flexible legs;
the first to go and test the road and and brave threatening rivers
and commit himself to an unfamiliar bridge,
nor does he shy at empty noises.  He has an erect neck
and a fine head, a small belly and a stout back,
and his strong chest abounds with muscles.
Chestnuts and grays are respectable, the worst colors are white and dun.
Then, if the clash of arms perchance is heard far off,
he doesn't know how to stand still, he pricks his ears and shakes his limbs,
and clamping his mouth he rolls steam from his nostrils.
========================================
densa iuba, et dextro iactata recumbit in armo;&

praecipue: hinc alias artis prolemque parentum&
et quis cuique dolor uicto, quae gloria palmae.
========================================
He has a thick mane, that falls to his right shoulder after being tossed;
and a hollow spine runs from loin to loin, and he paws at
the ground with a solid hoof with a deep sound.
Such a one was Cyllarus, mastered by the reins of Pollux from Amyclaeus,
and those that the Greek poets remembered,
the yoked-together horses of Mars and those of great Achilles' chariot.
Even the great Saturn himself sent his mane flowing from his equine neck
when his persistent wife showed up, and
filled lofty Pelion with his high-pitched neighing as he fled.

Likewise, when one is failing, by grave illness or sluggishness of years,
set him aside, and show no mercy for unseemly old age.
An older horse is cold in mating, and drags out the fruitless labor in vain,
and, if ever he's led to the battle, he rages vainly,  
without strength, like a once great fire in straw,
Therefore, pay particular attention to age and spirit:
afterwards to other qualities and to parentage
and who had anguish at defeat, and who the glory of the victory palm.
========================================

nonne uides, cum praecipiti certamine campum&

========================================
Don't you see how they've taken the field and swept off
in a breakneck race, with the chariots pouring out of the starting gate,
as the raised hopes of the youths,
and a pulsing trembling exhausts their leaping hearts?
They threaten with a whirling whip
and lean forward to slack the reins, the eager axle flies with strength;
and now stooping low, now standing up, they seem to be borne up high 
through empty air and to rise up into the breezes.
And no delay nor rest; but a cloud of yellow sand is raised,
they're splashed by the froth and snorting of their pursuers:
so great is the love of lauds, so great the care for victory.
Bold Ericthonius was the first to yoke four horses to a chariot 
and to stand upon the wheels, swift and triumphant.
The Lapithae set themselves on their backs;
they gave us training rings and Pelethronian bridles,
and they trained the armored horseman to vault from the ground
to the saddle, tucking his feet high up under his butt.
========================================

equus uterque labor, aeque iuuenemque magistri&
exquirunt calidumque animis et cursibus acrem,&
quamuis saepe fuga uersos ille egerit hostis  &              120

inualidique patrum referant ieiunia nati.
========================================
Both the horse and the labor, trainers equally seek out
youth and heart and keenness for racing,
despite how often he might've charged the enemy and turned it back in flight,
or claim his homeland as Epirus or mighty Mycenae,
or derive his lineage from Neptune's very birth.

They make sure to pay attention to these things at the time and
everyone takes care to bulk up the one that
they chose and declared as the leader and husband to the herd,
and they mow the flourishing hay and supply running water
and grain, so that he should not fall short for the pleasant 'toil'
and no feeble sons should repay their sires with lack.
========================================

========================================
But they stint the mares' food on purpose to slim them down,
and, when a familiar passion now arouses the first matings,
and they deny them foliage and shut them away from springs.
They even often stir them into a gallop and tire them in the sun,
when the threshing floor groans deeply under crops being crushed, and
as the empty husks are tossed to the rising West Wind.
This they do, lest usefullness be battered by too much luxury
and fill the idle furrows in a fruitful field with mud,
but should thirstily seize Venus and hide her deep within.

On the other hand, care for the sires begins to fall and for the dams to rise,
as the pregnant mares wander as the months come to an end,
let no man yoke them to heavy wagons to lead,
or suffer them to leap off the road
or graze meadows on a headland or swim rapacious rivers in flight.
They feed them in empty glades and alongside full rivers,
where there is moss and bank greenest with grass,
and caves protect them and the rocky shade stretches out.
========================================

========================================
There is, flying around the groves of Silarus and green Alburnus
in the scarlet oaks, a horde of gadflies, whose Roman name is 'asilus',
and the Greeks call in their turn 'oestrus'.
It makes a rough harsh sound, and sends the whole terrified herd
scattering through the woods; the air, shaken with their bellowing,
rages in the woods and on the bank of dry Tanager.
Juno once exercised terrible rages with this monster 
after planning a plague for young Io.
This plaque, too, you'll ward away from pregnant cattle by feeding the herd
with the sun freshly risen or with the stars leading in the night
(for it threatens more bitterly in the midday heat).

After the birth, all care is transferred to the calves;
and straight away they brand on the marks and names of their lineage,
and those that they pick to keep for the herd, or to submit
to altars to serve holy men, or to tear the earth
and to turn the rough plain upside down in broken clods.
========================================

cetera pascuntur uiridis armenta per herbas:&
tu quos ad studium atque usum formabis agrestem&

post ualido nitens sub pondere faginus axis
instrepat, et iunctos temo trahat aereus orbis.&
========================================
The rest of the herd are grazed on green grass,
but these you'll shape for a rustic zeal and use.
Urge the calves on now and set about to tame them,
while the spirits of the young are easy, while they're at a malleable age.
First, fasten wide hoops made from twigs to their slender napes;
then, when their free necks get used to servitude,
yoke matching pairs, collar to collar,
and train the young bulls to walk in step;
and often let them now pull unladen wheels across the ground,
leaving shallow tracks in the topmost dust.
Later, let the beech axle groan, straining under a potent weight,
and the brass-clad pole drag attached wheel-hoops.
========================================

interea pubi indomitae non gramina tantum&

========================================
Meanwhile, for an untamed bollock, its not only grass,
nor thin willow leaves or marsh sedge,
but sown grains that you pick by hand;
nor will nursing cows fill up snow-white milking pails for you,
as was our fathers' wont,
but they'll exhaust their udders' all for their sweet offspring.

But if instead the purpose is for war and for the fierce cavalry,
or to glide along the Alpheian rivers on Pisan wheels
or to drive Jove's flying chariots in his sacred grove,
the first work for a horse is to see the courage and arms 
of the fighters and to hear war-trumpets,
and the groans of hauling wheels, and the ring of bridles in his stall;
then to rejoice more and more in the trainer's coaxing praise
and to love the sound of his hand clapping his neck.
And after these things, let him first venture from his dam's teat,
and let him give his mouth in turn to tender halters,
still weak and trembling, still ignorant of life.
========================================

========================================
But when the third summer is done and the fourth one grows near,
let him soon start going round the ring, sounding out his ordered paces,
and bending his whirling legs in turn,
and let it be like he's working now;
now let him challenge the wind to race,
and flying across the open plains as if free of the reins,
let him barely set his tracks upon the surface of the sand:
just like the potent North Wind when it presses hard on the shores,
and scatters Scythian storms and rainless clouds,
then tall grain and rippling plains tremble in the first light breezes,
and the tallest forests give voice, and boundless waves press on to the shore;
he likewise flies across the fields, skimming too the plains.
Either he'll sweat henceforth towards the Hippodrome's winning post
and its great level expanse and will pass bloody foam from his mouth,
or better, he'll pull British chariots with his supple neck.
========================================

tum demum crassa magnum farragine corpus  &             205

========================================
Then, broken at last, let his body
thrive and grow great on rich fodder;
for before being broken they'll raise vast spirits,
and those captured will refuse to bear long-lasting beatings
or to obey hard jagged bits.

But no activity strengthens with greater force
than to divert them from sex and the spurs of blind love,
whether it's cattle or horses that you're breeding.
And therefore people relegate the bulls to distant and lonely pastures
behind an intervening mountain and past broad rivers,
or they keep them at well-filled mangers in enclosures.
For seeing females erodes and burns their strength, little by little -
she makes them forget both forests and grass so much
with her sweet allurements, and often compels her proud lovers
to fight among themselves with horns and hooves to settle the matter.
The fair heifer grazes in great Sila:
the bulls join in many battles of strength, back and forth,
with wounds laid on thick; their black blood washes their bodies,
their horns are turned to press against those standing their ground
with a monstrous groan; both the woods and tall Olympus bellow back.
========================================

========================================
Nor is it the custom for rivals to stable together, but the one
that's conquered leaves, and lives in exile far away by unknown shores,
deeply lamenting his disgrace and the blows from the proud victor,
then those loves that he lost, unavenged.
And gazing on the stables he withdraws from his ancestral realms.
And so he trains his strength with every care and 
lies all night long among the hard stones for his bed,
fed on prickly leaves and spiky rushes,
and puts himself to the test and learns to turn his horns to rage,
thrusting at the trunk of a tree, and challenges the winds 
with blows, throws sand about and practices for battle.
========================================

post ubi collectum robur uiresque refectae,     &          235
signa mouet praecepsque oblitum fertur in hostem:&
fluctus uti medio coepit cum albescere ponto,&
longius ex altoque sinum trahit, utque uolutus&
ad terras immane sonat per saxa neque ipso&
monte minor procumbit, at ima exaestuat unda   &             240
uerticibus nigramque alte subiectat harenam.&
      Omne adeo genus in terris hominumque ferarumque&
et genus aequoreum, pecudes pictaeque uolucres,&
in furias ignemque ruunt: amor omnibus idem.&
tempore non alio catulorum oblita leaena   &            245
saeuior errauit campis, nec funera uulgo&
tam multa informes ursi stragemque dedere&
per siluas; tum saeuus aper, tum pessima tigris;&
heu male tum Libyae solis erratur in agris.
========================================
Afterwards, when his vigor has recovered and his strength been restored,
he brandishes his standards and races headlong at his oblivious foe:
as when a wave starts to gleam in the middle of a far-off sea,
and drags its bosom out of the deep, rolling on to land
to crash with a roar upon the rocks, as big as
an actual mountain, while deep down a wave boils up
and casts dusky sand up out of the deep in whirlpools.
   In such a wise every race, both of man and beast on land
and each race of the sea, herd animal and bright-colored bird,
charge into fury and fire: love is the same to all.
Never more savagely did the lioness,
forgetting her cubs, range across the plains,
nor did deformed bears usually yield so many corpses and havoc
throughout the forests; then the savage boar, then the wickedest tiger;
alas! ill then for one who wanders alone in the fields of Libya.
========================================

nonne uides ut tota tremor pertemptet equorum  &             250
corpora, si tantum notas odor attulit auras?&
ac neque eos iam frena uirum neque uerbera saeua,&
non scopuli rupesque cauae atque obiecta retardant&
flumina correptosque unda torquentia montis.&
ipse ruit dentesque Sabellicus exacuit sus    &           255
et pede prosubigit terram, fricat arbore costas&
atque hinc atque illinc umeros ad uulnera durat.&
quid iuuenis, magnum cui uersat in ossibus ignem&
durus amor? nempe abruptis turbata procellis&
nocte natat caeca serus freta, quem super ingens    &           260
porta tonat caeli, et scopulis inlisa reclamant&
aequora; nec miseri possunt reuocare parentes,&
nec moritura super crudeli funere uirgo.
========================================
Don't you see how a tremor shakes the horse's body,
when some such odor is wafted in on familiar breezes?
And no longer do either man's restraints or savage whips,
nor boulders or hollow rocks hold him back,
or confining rivers that sweep mountains away with a twisting wave.
The great Sabine boar charges in and sharpens its tusks
and paws at the earth to dig it up, rubs his ribs on trees
and hither and thither hardens its shoulders against wounds.
What of the young man, in whose bones harsh love twirls a great flame?
Truly, while storms tear through the troubled night
he swims too late in the gloomy sea, upon which
the vast portal of heaven thunders and the waves,
dashed on boulders, cry out in protest;
his wretched parents can not call him back,
nor can the maid, soon to die upon his cruel pyre.
========================================

quid lynces Bacchi uariae et genus acre luporum&
atque canum? quid quae imbelles dant proelia cerui?   &            265
scilicet ante omnis furor est insignis equarum;&
et mentem Venus ipsa dedit, quo tempore Glauci&
Potniades malis membra absumpsere quadrigae.&
illas ducit amor trans Gargara transque sonantem&
Ascanium; superant montis et flumina tranant. &              270
continuoque auidis ubi subdita flamma medullis&
(uere magis, quia uere calor redit ossibus), illae&
ore omnes uersae in Zephyrum stant rupibus altis,&
exceptantque leuis auras, et saepe sine ullis&
coniugiis uento grauidae (mirabile dictu) &             275
saxa per et scopulos et depressas conuallis&
diffugiunt, non, Eure, tuos neque solis ad ortus,&
in Borean Caurumque, aut unde nigerrimus Auster&
nascitur et pluuio contristat frigore caelum.
========================================
What of Bacchus' mottled lynxes or the shrewd race of wolves and dogs?
What of the battles that peace-loving stags do give?
Certainly, the frenzy of mares in heat is remarked above all;
and Venus herself gave them purpose, when Glaucus of Potniae's
four-horse team destroyed his limbs with their jaws.
Love leads them across Mt Ida and the rushing Ascanius River;
they surmount mountains and swim across rivers.
And at once with their inward marrows burning as if lit by a flame
(more so in the spring, since heat returns to the bones in the spring), they all,
with faces turned into the West Wind, stand on high cliffs,
and sniff light breezes and, oftimes pregnant by the wind
with nary a mate (wonderous to tell),
they scatter across stones and rocks and deep valleys,
not toward your rising, East Wind, and not towards the sun's,
but to the North and Northwest, or from where the blackest South Wind
is born and darkens the sky with rainy cold.
========================================

hic demum, hippomanes uero quod nomine dicunt   &            280
pastores, lentum destillat ab inguine uirus,&
hippomanes, quod saepe malae legere nouercae&
miscueruntque herbas et non innoxia uerba.&
      Sed fugit interea, fugit inreparabile tempus,&
singula dum capti circumuectamur amore.     &          285
hoc satis armentis: superat pars altera curae,&
lanigeros agitare greges hirtasque capellas;&
hic labor, hinc laudem fortes sperate coloni.&
nec sum animi dubius uerbis ea uincere magnum&
quam sit et angustis hunc addere rebus honorem;   &            290
sed me Parnasi deserta per ardua dulcis&
raptat amor; iuuat ire iugis, qua nulla priorum&
Castaliam molli deuertitur orbita cliuo.&
nunc, ueneranda Pales, magno nunc ore sonandum.
========================================
Here at last, the heat-discharge that herdsmen call 'horse-madness' in truth,
the slimy poison dripping from the mares' vulvas,
this discharge, that often evil stepmothers gather
and mix with herbs and not harmless words.

But meanwhile it flies, time, irrecoverable, flies,
and passes us, caught by every love-charm, by.
That's enough for herds: another part of care remains,
to consider the woolly flocks and shaggy goats;
this toil, look for praise from this, steadfast herdsmen.
And I have no doubt how hard it'd be to conquer this with words,
and lay this honor on such narrow matters;
but sweet love carries me off across the steep deserts of Parnasus;
it delights me to walk unceasingly where no earlier track
turns down a gentle slope towards the Castalian fountain.
Now, revered Pales, I needs must shout out in a loud voice.
