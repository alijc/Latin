Te quoque, magna Pales, et te memorande canemus
pastor ab Amphryso, uos, siluae amnesque Lycaei.
cetera, quae uacuas tenuissent carmine mentes,
omnia iam uulgata: quis aut Eurysthea durum
aut inlaudati nescit Busiridis aras?               5
cui non dictus Hylas puer et Latonia Delos
Hippodameque umeroque Pelops insignis eburno,
acer equis? temptanda uia est, qua me quoque possim
tollere humo uictorque uirum uolitare per ora.
primus ego in patriam mecum, modo uita supersit,               10
Aonio rediens deducam uertice Musas;
primus Idumaeas referam tibi, Mantua, palmas,
et uiridi in campo templum de marmore ponam
propter aquam, tardis ingens ubi flexibus errat
Mincius et tenera praetexit harundine ripas.               15
========================================
We'll also sing of you, great Pales, and you, Amphrysian shepherd,
and you, Lycaean woods and rivers. 
All other strains, that used to occupy vacant minds,
are now quite common: who doesn't know of stern Eurystheus
or detestable Busiris' altars.
Who has not heard of the boy Hylas, or Latona's Delos
or Hippodame or Pelops, marked by his ivory shoulder,
that keen charioteer.
A way must needs be found for me too to lift myself
from the ground and fly, victorious, above men's faces. 
first I'll take the Muses home with me, so long as life suffice,
returning from the top of Aonius;
first I'll return the Idumaean palms to you, Mantua,
and erect a marble temple on the green plain near the water,
where the Mincius wanders in slow turnings and weaves its banks in tender reeds.
========================================

in medio mihi Caesar erit templumque tenebit:
illi uictor ego et Tyrio conspectus in ostro
centum quadriiugos agitabo ad flumina currus.
cuncta mihi Alpheum linquens lucosque Molorchi
cursibus et crudo decernet Graecia caestu.               20
ipse caput tonsae foliis ornatus oliuae
dona feram. iam nunc sollemnis ducere pompas
ad delubra iuuat caesosque uidere iuuencos,
uel scaena ut uersis discedat frontibus utque
purpurea intexti tollant aulaea Britanni.               25
in foribus pugnam ex auro solidoque elephanto
Gangaridum faciam uictorisque arma Quirini,
atque hic undantem bello magnumque fluentem
Nilum ac nauali surgentis aere columnas.
addam urbes Asiae domitas pulsumque Niphaten               30
fidentemque fuga Parthum uersisque sagittis;
et duo rapta manu diuerso ex hoste tropaea
bisque triumphatas utroque ab litore gentis.
========================================
Within the temple my Caesar will be and will be master:
for him I, triumphant and conspicuous in Tyrian purple,
will drive a hundred four-horse chariots along the river.
All of Greece, forsaking the Alpheus and Molorchus' sacred groves for me,
will contend with races and with the rawhide boxing glove.
I myself will bear the gifts, my head adorned olives stripped of leaves.
It's pleasing now to lead solemn processions
to the shrines and to see the slaughtered bullocks,
either the stage might shift with revolving faces,
or the embroidered Britons might rise with the purple curtains.
On the doors I'll depict a battle out of gold and solid ivory -
the arms of the Ganges-dwellers and of the Roman victor,
and here the great surging Nile, flowing in war 
and towering columns topped with a naval crown.
I'll add the conquered cities of Asia and the routed Niphates
and the Parthian, trusting in flight and in backward-flying arrows;

and two trophies seized by hand/band out of a different enemy
and twice triumphant nations on both sides of the shore.
