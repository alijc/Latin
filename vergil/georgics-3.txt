Te quoque, magna Pales, et te memorande canemus
pastor ab Amphryso, uos, siluae amnesque Lycaei.
cetera, quae uacuas tenuissent carmine mentes,
omnia iam uulgata: quis aut Eurysthea durum
aut inlaudati nescit Busiridis aras?               5
cui non dictus Hylas puer et Latonia Delos
Hippodameque umeroque Pelops insignis eburno,
acer equis? temptanda uia est, qua me quoque possim
tollere humo uictorque uirum uolitare per ora.
primus ego in patriam mecum, modo uita supersit,               10
Aonio rediens deducam uertice Musas
primus Idumaeas referam tibi, Mantua, palmas,
et uiridi in campo templum de marmore ponam
propter aquam, tardis ingens ubi flexibus errat
Mincius et tenera praetexit harundine ripas.               15
========================================
We'll also sing of you, great Pales, and you, Amphrysian shepherd,
and you, Lycaean woods and rivers. 
All other strains, that used to occupy vacant minds,
are now quite common: who doesn't know of stern Eurystheus
or detestable Busiris' altars.
Who has not heard of the boy Hylas, or Latona's Delos
or Hippodame or Pelops, marked by his ivory shoulder,
that keen charioteer.
A way must needs be found for me too to lift myself
from the ground and fly, victorious, above men's faces. 
first I'll take the Muses home with me, so long as life suffice,
returning from the top of Aonius;
first I'll return the Idumaean palms to you, Mantua,
and erect a marble temple on the green plain near the water,
where the Mincius wanders in slow turnings and weaves its banks in tender reeds.
========================================

in medio mihi Caesar erit templumque tenebit:
illi uictor ego et Tyrio conspectus in ostro
centum quadriiugos agitabo ad flumina currus.
cuncta mihi Alpheum linquens lucosque Molorchi
cursibus et crudo decernet Graecia caestu.               20
ipse caput tonsae foliis ornatus oliuae
dona feram. iam nunc sollemnis ducere pompas
ad delubra iuuat caesosque uidere iuuencos,
uel scaena ut uersis discedat frontibus utque
purpurea intexti tollant aulaea Britanni.               25
in foribus pugnam ex auro solidoque elephanto
Gangaridum faciam uictorisque arma Quirini,
atque hic undantem bello magnumque fluentem
Nilum ac nauali surgentis aere columnas.
addam urbes Asiae domitas pulsumque Niphaten               30
fidentemque fuga Parthum uersisque sagittis;
et duo rapta manu diuerso ex hoste tropaea
bisque triumphatas utroque ab litore gentis.
========================================
Within my temple Caesar will dwell and will be master:
for him I, triumphant and viewed in Tyrian purple,
will drive a hundred four-horse chariots up along the river.
All of Greece, forsaking the Alpheus and Molorchus' sacred groves for me,
will contend in races and with the rawhide boxing glove.
I myself will bear the prizes, my head adorned with olive leaves.
Already now I'm pleased to lead the solemn processions
to the shrines and to see the slaughtered bullocks,
whether the stage shifts with revolving faces,
or the embroidered Britons rise with the purple curtains.
On the doors I'll depict a battle out of solid gold and ivory -
the Ganges-dwellers and the arms of the Roman victor,
and here the great surging Nile, flowing warlike,
and towering columns, topped with naval bronze.
I'll add the conquered cities of Asia and the routed Niphates
and the Parthian, trusting in flight and in backward-flying arrows;
and two trophies seized from the hands of different enemies
and twice triumphant nations from each end of the sea.
========================================

stabunt et Parii lapides, spirantia signa,&

========================================
And the marble statues will stand, breathing images,
the progeny of Assaracus and the great names of Jove's descendents,
and Troy's father, Tros, and founder, Cynthius.
Wretched envy will stand in fear of the Furies
and the harsh river of Cocytus and Ixion's snakes,
and the monstrous wheel and Sisyphus' unsurmountable stone.
Meanwhile, let us range over the wood-nymphs' woods and virgin passes,
observing your, Maecenas, by no means gentle commands:
without you the mind begins no lofty thing.  Come on!
tear down what slows you down; Mt Cithaeron calls with a huge clamor
and Taygetian dogs and Epidaurus, the tamer of horses,
and, redoubled in assent, the forests' voice bellows back.
Yet presently I'll gird myself to tell of Caesar's blazing battles
and bear his name in fame through as many years
as there are from the birth of Tithonus to Caesar.
========================================

Seu quis Olympiacae miratus praemia palmae&

========================================
Whether one raises horses in hopes of prizes of the Olympian palm,
or perhaps bullocks for the plow,
let him be particular in chosing the dams.  The best looking cow
has a grim face, an ugly head and a huge neck,
and dewlaps hanging from her chin down to her shanks;
with no end to the length of her flanks: everything large,
even her feet, and shaggy ears under inward-curving horns.
And I'd not be displeased by conspicuous white spots,
or recoiling from the yoke or a sometimes violent horn
and a face more like a bull's, and totally tall
and in her walk her tail sweeps the bottom of the track.
The age to allow for proper mating and for birth
starts after four years and ends before ten;
outside of that she's neither fit to breed nor strong enough to plow.
Meanwhile, while cheerful youth is left to the herds
set the males loose; first off, send the herds to venery,
and provide one generation after another for breeding.
========================================

========================================
Whichever day is best is always the first to flee from mortal wretches;
illnesses and sad old age and suffering draw near,
and the harshness of cruel death rushes in.
There will always be those whose bodies have changed for the worse:
always change them out, above all come to choose the offspring for the herd
each year, lest you afterwards miss what has been lost.

And too, it's the same choice for a herd of horses:
if only you choose them in hopes of rearing a good line,
expend particular labor on them from the time they're young.
From his first steps a well-bred foal walks more erectly
in the fields and bends flexible legs;
the first to go and test the road and and brave threatening rivers
and commit himself to an unfamiliar bridge,
nor does he shy at empty noises.  He has an erect neck
and a fine head, a small belly and a stout back,
and his strong chest abounds with muscles.
Chestnuts and grays are respectable, the worst colors are white and dun.
Then, if the clash of arms perchance is heard far off,
he doesn't know how to stand still, he pricks his ears and shakes his limbs,
and clamping his mouth he rolls steam from his nostrils.
========================================
densa iuba, et dextro iactata recumbit in armo;&
at duplex agitur per lumbos spina, cauatque&

Pelion hinnitu fugiens impleuit acuto.&
      Hunc quoque, ubi aut morbo grauis aut iam segnior annis    &       95

frigidus in Venerem senior, frustraque laborem&
ingratum trahit, et, si quando ad proelia uentum est,&
ut quondam in stipulis magnus sine uiribus ignis,&
incassum furit. ergo animos aeuumque notabis  &             100
praecipue: hinc alias artis prolemque parentum&
et quis cuique dolor uicto, quae gloria palmae.
========================================
He has a thick mane, that falls to his right shoulder after being tossed;
and a hollow spine runs from loin to loin, and he paws at
the ground with a solid hoof with a deep sound.
Such a one was Cyllarus, mastered by the reins of Pollux from Amyclaeus,
and those that the Greek poets remembered,
the yoked-together horses of Mars and those of great Achilles' chariot.
Even the great Saturn himself sent his mane flowing from his equine neck
when his persistent wife showed up, and
filled lofty Pelion with his high-pitched neighing as he fled.

Likewise, when one is failing, by grave illness or sluggishness of years,
set him aside, and show no mercy for unseemly old age.
An older horse is cold in mating, and drags out the fruitless labor in vain,
and, if ever he's led to the battle, he rages vainly,  
without strength, like a once great fire in straw,
Therefore, pay particular attention to age and spirit:
afterwards to other qualities and to parentage
and who had anguish at defeat, and who the glory of the victory palm.
========================================

nonne uides, cum praecipiti certamine campum&
corripuere, ruuntque effusi carcere currus,&
cum spes adrectae iuuenum, exsultantiaque haurit  &             105

impositi dorso, atque equitem docuere sub armis&
insultare solo et gressus glomerare superbos.
========================================
Don't you see how they've taken the field and swept off
in a breakneck race, with the chariots pouring out of the starting gate,
as the raised hopes of the youths,
and a pulsing trembling exhausts their leaping hearts?
They threaten with a whirling whip
and lean forward to slack the reins, the eager axle flies with strength;
and now stooping low, now standing up, they seem to be borne up high 
through empty air and to rise up into the breezes.
And no delay nor rest; but a cloud of yellow sand is raised,
they're splashed by the froth and snorting of their pursuers:
so great is the love of lauds, so great the care for victory.
Bold Ericthonius was the first to yoke four horses to a chariot 
and to stand upon the wheels, swift and triumphant.
The Lapithae set themselves on their backs;
they gave us training rings and Pelethronian bridles,
and they trained the armored horseman to vault from the ground
to the saddle, tucking his feet high up under his butt.
========================================

equus uterque labor, aeque iuuenemque magistri&
exquirunt calidumque animis et cursibus acrem,&
quamuis saepe fuga uersos ille egerit hostis  &              120
et patriam Epirum referat fortisque Mycenas,&
Neptunique ipsa deducat origine gentem.&
      His animaduersis instant sub tempus et omnis&
impendunt curas denso distendere pingui,&

florentisque secant herbas fluuiosque ministrant&
farraque, ne blando nequeat superesse labori&
inualidique patrum referant ieiunia nati.
========================================
Both the horse and the labor, trainers equally seek out
youth and heart and keenness for racing,
despite how often he might've charged the enemy and turned it back in flight,
or claim his homeland as Epirus or mighty Mycenae,
or derive his lineage from Neptune's very birth.

They make sure to pay attention to these things at the time and
everyone takes care to bulk up the one that
they chose and declared as the leader and husband to the herd,
and they mow the flourishing hay and supply running water
and grain, so that he should not fall short for the pleasant 'toil'
and no feeble sons should repay their sires with lack.
========================================

ipsa autem macie tenuant armenta uolentes,&
atque, ubi concubitus primos iam nota uoluptas  &             130

hoc faciunt, nimio ne luxu obtunsior usus &              135

========================================
But they stint the mares' food on purpose to slim them down,
and, when a familiar passion now arouses the first matings,
and they deny them foliage and shut them away from springs.
They even often stir them into a gallop and tire them in the sun,
when the threshing floor groans deeply under crops being crushed, and
as the empty husks are tossed to the rising West Wind.
This they do, lest usefullness be battered by too much luxury
and fill the idle furrows in a fruitful field with mud,
but should thirstily seize Venus and hide her deep within.

On the other hand, care for the sires begins to fall and for the dams to rise,
as the pregnant mares wander as the months come to an end,
let no man yoke them to heavy wagons to lead,
or suffer them to leap off the road
or graze meadows on a headland or swim rapacious rivers in flight.
They feed them in empty glades and alongside full rivers,
where there is moss and bank greenest with grass,
and caves protect them and the rocky shade stretches out.
========================================

========================================
There is, flying around the groves of Silarus and green sapwood
in the scarlet oaks, a multitude, whose Roman name is 'asilus' (gadfly),
that the Greeks call in their turn 'oestrus',
rough, sounding harsh, from which the whole terrified herd
scatters in the woods; the ether rages with bellowing,
struck in the woods and on the bank of dry Tanager.
WIth this monster Juno once exercised terrible rages
having planned a plague for young Io.
>her also (for with middle of boiling sharper it pursues)
you'll ward away from pregnant cattle and you'll feed the herd
fresh with the sun risen or with stars leading in the night.

After the birth, all care is transferred to the calves;
and continuosly >known clans and names they burn in (brand?),
and >those who or to herd they prefer thinking to submit
or toby altars to keep holyMM or to tear the earth
and to turn the rough plain upside down in broken clods.
