Te quoque, magna Pales, et te memorande canemus
pastor ab Amphryso, uos, siluae amnesque Lycaei.
cetera, quae uacuas tenuissent carmine mentes,
omnia iam uulgata: quis aut Eurysthea durum
aut inlaudati nescit Busiridis aras?               5
cui non dictus Hylas puer et Latonia Delos
Hippodameque umeroque Pelops insignis eburno,
acer equis? temptanda uia est, qua me quoque possim
tollere humo uictorque uirum uolitare per ora.
primus ego in patriam mecum, modo uita supersit,               10
Aonio rediens deducam uertice Musas
primus Idumaeas referam tibi, Mantua, palmas,
et uiridi in campo templum de marmore ponam
propter aquam, tardis ingens ubi flexibus errat
Mincius et tenera praetexit harundine ripas.               15
========================================
We'll also sing of you, great Pales, and you, Amphrysian shepherd,
and you, Lycaean woods and rivers. 
All other strains, that used to occupy vacant minds,
are now quite common: who doesn't know of stern Eurystheus
or detestable Busiris' altars.
Who has not heard of the boy Hylas, or Latona's Delos
or Hippodame or Pelops, marked by his ivory shoulder,
that keen charioteer.
A way must needs be found for me too to lift myself
from the ground and fly, victorious, above men's faces. 
first I'll take the Muses home with me, so long as life suffice,
returning from the top of Aonius;
first I'll return the Idumaean palms to you, Mantua,
and erect a marble temple on the green plain near the water,
where the Mincius wanders in slow turnings and weaves its banks in tender reeds.
========================================

in medio mihi Caesar erit templumque tenebit:
illi uictor ego et Tyrio conspectus in ostro
centum quadriiugos agitabo ad flumina currus.
cuncta mihi Alpheum linquens lucosque Molorchi
cursibus et crudo decernet Graecia caestu.               20
ipse caput tonsae foliis ornatus oliuae
dona feram. iam nunc sollemnis ducere pompas
ad delubra iuuat caesosque uidere iuuencos,
uel scaena ut uersis discedat frontibus utque
purpurea intexti tollant aulaea Britanni.               25
in foribus pugnam ex auro solidoque elephanto
Gangaridum faciam uictorisque arma Quirini,
atque hic undantem bello magnumque fluentem
Nilum ac nauali surgentis aere columnas.
addam urbes Asiae domitas pulsumque Niphaten               30
fidentemque fuga Parthum uersisque sagittis;
et duo rapta manu diuerso ex hoste tropaea
bisque triumphatas utroque ab litore gentis.
========================================
Within my temple Caesar will dwell and will be master:
for him I, triumphant and viewed in Tyrian purple,
will drive a hundred four-horse chariots up along the river.
All of Greece, forsaking the Alpheus and Molorchus' sacred groves for me,
will contend in races and with the rawhide boxing glove.
I myself will bear the prizes, my head adorned with olive leaves.
Already now I'm pleased to lead the solemn processions
to the shrines and to see the slaughtered bullocks,
whether the stage shifts with revolving faces,
or the embroidered Britons rise with the purple curtains.
On the doors I'll depict a battle out of solid gold and ivory -
the Ganges-dwellers and the arms of the Roman victor,
and here the great surging Nile, flowing warlike,
and towering columns, topped with naval bronze.
I'll add the conquered cities of Asia and the routed Niphates
and the Parthian, trusting in flight and in backward-flying arrows;
and two trophies seized from the hands of different enemies
and twice triumphant nations from each end of the sea.
========================================

========================================
And the marble statues will stand, breathing images,
the progeny of Assaracus and the great names of Jove's descendents,
and Troy's father, Tros, and founder, Cynthius.
Wretched envy will stand in fear of the Furies
and the harsh river of Cocytus and Ixion's snakes,
and the monstrous wheel and Sisyphus' unsurmountable stone.
Meanwhile, let us range over the wood-nymphs' woods and virgin passes,
observing your, Maecenas, by no means gentle commands:
without you the mind begins no lofty thing.  Come on!
tear down what slows you down; Mt Cithaeron calls with a huge clamor
and Taygetian dogs and Epidaurus, the tamer of horses,
and, redoubled in assent, the forests' voice bellows back.
Yet presently I'll gird myself to tell of Caesar's blazing battles
and bear his name in fame through as many years
as there are from the birth of Tithonus to Caesar.
========================================

========================================
Whether one raises horses in hopes of prizes of the Olympian palm,
or perhaps bullocks for the plow,
let him be particular in chosing the dams.  The best looking cow
has a grim face, an ugly head and a huge neck,
and dewlaps hanging from her chin down to her shanks;
with no end to the length of her flanks: everything large,
even her feet, and shaggy ears under inward-curving horns.
And I'd not be displeased by conspicuous white spots,
or recoiling from the yoke or a sometimes violent horn
and a face more like a bull's, and totally tall
and in her walk her tail sweeps the bottom of the track.
The age to allow for proper mating and for birth
starts after four years and ends before ten;
outside of that she's neither fit to breed nor strong enough to plow.
Meanwhile, while cheerful youth is left to the herds
set the males loose; first off, send the herds to venery,
and provide one generation after another for breeding.

========================================
Whichever day is best is always the first to flee from mortal wretches;
illnesses and sad old age and suffering draw near,
and the harshness of cruel death rushes in.
There will always be those whose bodies have changed for the worse:
always change them out, above all come to choose the offspring for the herd
each year, lest you afterwards miss what has been lost.

And too, it's the same choice for a herd of horses:
if only you choose them in hopes of rearing a good line,
expend particular labor on them from the time they're young.
From his first steps a well-bred foal walks more erectly
in the fields and bends flexible legs;
the first to go and test the road and and brave threatening rivers
and commit himself to an unfamiliar bridge,
nor does he shy at empty noises.  He has an erect neck
and a fine head, a small belly and a stout back,
and his strong chest abounds with muscles.
Chestnuts and grays are respectable, the worst colors are white and dun.
Then, if the clash of arms perchance is heard far off,
he doesn't know how to stand still, he pricks his ears and shakes his limbs,
and clamping his mouth he rolls steam from his nostrils.
========================================
densa iuba, et dextro iactata recumbit in armo;&

praecipue: hinc alias artis prolemque parentum&
et quis cuique dolor uicto, quae gloria palmae.
========================================
He has a thick mane, that falls to his right shoulder after being tossed;
and a hollow spine runs from loin to loin, and he paws at
the ground with a solid hoof with a deep sound.
Such a one was Cyllarus, mastered by the reins of Pollux from Amyclaeus,
and those that the Greek poets remembered,
the yoked-together horses of Mars and those of great Achilles' chariot.
Even the great Saturn himself sent his mane flowing from his equine neck
when his persistent wife showed up, and
filled lofty Pelion with his high-pitched neighing as he fled.

Likewise, when one is failing, by grave illness or sluggishness of years,
set him aside, and show no mercy for unseemly old age.
An older horse is cold in mating, and drags out the fruitless labor in vain,
and, if ever he's led to the battle, he rages vainly,  
without strength, like a once great fire in straw,
Therefore, pay particular attention to age and spirit:
afterwards to other qualities and to parentage
and who had anguish at defeat, and who the glory of the victory palm.
========================================

nonne uides, cum praecipiti certamine campum&

========================================
Don't you see how they've taken the field and swept off
in a breakneck race, with the chariots pouring out of the starting gate,
as the raised hopes of the youths,
and a pulsing trembling exhausts their leaping hearts?
They threaten with a whirling whip
and lean forward to slack the reins, the eager axle flies with strength;
and now stooping low, now standing up, they seem to be borne up high 
through empty air and to rise up into the breezes.
And no delay nor rest; but a cloud of yellow sand is raised,
they're splashed by the froth and snorting of their pursuers:
so great is the love of lauds, so great the care for victory.
Bold Ericthonius was the first to yoke four horses to a chariot 
and to stand upon the wheels, swift and triumphant.
The Lapithae set themselves on their backs;
they gave us training rings and Pelethronian bridles,
and they trained the armored horseman to vault from the ground
to the saddle, tucking his feet high up under his butt.
========================================

equus uterque labor, aeque iuuenemque magistri&
exquirunt calidumque animis et cursibus acrem,&
quamuis saepe fuga uersos ille egerit hostis  &              120

inualidique patrum referant ieiunia nati.
========================================
Both the horse and the labor, trainers equally seek out
youth and heart and keenness for racing,
despite how often he might've charged the enemy and turned it back in flight,
or claim his homeland as Epirus or mighty Mycenae,
or derive his lineage from Neptune's very birth.

They make sure to pay attention to these things at the time and
everyone takes care to bulk up the one that
they chose and declared as the leader and husband to the herd,
and they mow the flourishing hay and supply running water
and grain, so that he should not fall short for the pleasant 'toil'
and no feeble sons should repay their sires with lack.
========================================

========================================
But they stint the mares' food on purpose to slim them down,
and, when a familiar passion now arouses the first matings,
and they deny them foliage and shut them away from springs.
They even often stir them into a gallop and tire them in the sun,
when the threshing floor groans deeply under crops being crushed, and
as the empty husks are tossed to the rising West Wind.
This they do, lest usefullness be battered by too much luxury
and fill the idle furrows in a fruitful field with mud,
but should thirstily seize Venus and hide her deep within.

On the other hand, care for the sires begins to fall and for the dams to rise,
as the pregnant mares wander as the months come to an end,
let no man yoke them to heavy wagons to lead,
or suffer them to leap off the road
or graze meadows on a headland or swim rapacious rivers in flight.
They feed them in empty glades and alongside full rivers,
where there is moss and bank greenest with grass,
and caves protect them and the rocky shade stretches out.
========================================

========================================
There is, flying around the groves of Silarus and green Alburnus
in the scarlet oaks, a horde of gadflies, whose Roman name is 'asilus',
and the Greeks call in their turn 'oestrus'.
It makes a rough harsh sound, and sends the whole terrified herd
scattering through the woods; the air, shaken with their bellowing,
rages in the woods and on the bank of dry Tanager.
Juno once exercised terrible rages with this monster 
after planning a plague for young Io.
This plaque, too, you'll ward away from pregnant cattle by feeding the herd
with the sun freshly risen or with the stars leading in the night
(for it threatens more bitterly in the midday heat).

After the birth, all care is transferred to the calves;
and straight away they brand on the marks and names of their lineage,
and those that they pick to keep for the herd, or to submit
to altars to serve holy men, or to tear the earth
and to turn the rough plain upside down in broken clods.
========================================

cetera pascuntur uiridis armenta per herbas:&
tu quos ad studium atque usum formabis agrestem&

post ualido nitens sub pondere faginus axis
instrepat, et iunctos temo trahat aereus orbis.&
========================================
The rest of the herd are grazed on green grass,
but these you'll shape for a rustic zeal and use.
Urge the calves on now and set about to tame them,
while the spirits of the young are easy, while they're at a malleable age.
First, fasten wide hoops made from twigs to their slender napes;
then, when their free necks get used to servitude,
yoke matching pairs, collar to collar,
and train the young bulls to walk in step;
and often let them now pull unladen wheels across the ground,
leaving shallow tracks in the topmost dust.
Later, let the beech axle groan, straining under a potent weight,
and the brass-clad pole drag attached wheel-hoops.
========================================

interea pubi indomitae non gramina tantum&

========================================
Meanwhile, for an untamed bollock, its not only grass,
nor thin willow leaves or marsh sedge,
but sown grains that you pick by hand;
nor will nursing cows fill up snow-white milking pails for you,
as was our fathers' wont,
but they'll exhaust their udders' all for their sweet offspring.

But if instead the purpose is for war and for the fierce cavalry,
or to glide along the Alpheian rivers on Pisan wheels
or to drive Jove's flying chariots in his sacred grove,
the first work for a horse is to see the courage and arms 
of the fighters and to hear war-trumpets,
and the groans of hauling wheels, and the ring of bridles in his stall;
then to rejoice more and more in the trainer's coaxing praise
and to love the sound of his hand clapping his neck.
And after these things, let him first venture from his dam's teat,
and let him give his mouth in turn to tender halters,
still weak and trembling, still ignorant of life.
========================================

========================================
But when the third summer is done and the fourth one grows near,
let him soon start going round the ring, sounding out his ordered paces,
and bending his whirling legs in turn,
and let it be like he's working now;
now let him challenge the wind to race,
and flying across the open plains as if free of the reins,
let him barely set his tracks upon the surface of the sand:
just like the potent North Wind when it presses hard on the shores,
and scatters Scythian storms and rainless clouds,
then tall grain and rippling plains tremble in the first light breezes,
and the tallest forests give voice, and boundless waves press on to the shore;
he likewise flies across the fields, skimming too the plains.
Either he'll sweat henceforth towards the Hippodrome's winning post
and its great level expanse and will pass bloody foam from his mouth,
or better, he'll pull British chariots with his supple neck.
========================================

tum demum crassa magnum farragine corpus  &             205

========================================
Then, broken at last, let his body
thrive and grow great on rich fodder;
for before being broken they'll raise vast spirits,
and those captured will refuse to bear long-lasting beatings
or to obey hard jagged bits.

But no activity strengthens with greater force
than to divert them from sex and the spurs of blind love,
whether it's cattle or horses that you're breeding.
And therefore people relegate the bulls to distant and lonely pastures
behind an intervening mountain and past broad rivers,
or they keep them at well-filled mangers in enclosures.
For seeing females erodes and burns their strength, little by little -
she makes them forget both forests and grass so much
with her sweet allurements, and often compels her proud lovers
to fight among themselves with horns and hooves to settle the matter.
The fair heifer grazes in great Sila:
the bulls join in many battles of strength, back and forth,
with wounds laid on thick; their black blood washes their bodies,
their horns are turned to press against those standing their ground
with a monstrous groan; both the woods and tall Olympus bellow back.
========================================

========================================
Nor is it the custom for rivals to stable together, but the one
that's conquered leaves, and lives in exile far away by unknown shores,
deeply lamenting his disgrace and the blows from the proud victor,
then those loves that he lost, unavenged.
And gazing on the stables he withdraws from his ancestral realms.
And so he trains his strength with every care and 
lies all night long among the hard stones for his bed,
fed on prickly leaves and spiky rushes,
and puts himself to the test and learns to turn his horns to rage,
thrusting at the trunk of a tree, and challenges the winds 
with blows, throws sand about and practices for battle.
========================================

post ubi collectum robur uiresque refectae,     &          235

========================================
Afterwards, when his vigor has recovered and his strength been restored,
he brandishes his standards and races headlong at his oblivious foe:
as when a wave starts to gleam in the middle of a far-off sea,
and drags its bosom out of the deep, rolling on to land
to crash with a roar upon the rocks, as big as
an actual mountain, while deep down a wave boils up
and casts dusky sand up out of the deep in whirlpools.
   In such a wise every race, both of man and beast on land
and each race of the sea, herd animal and bright-colored bird,
charge into fury and fire: love is the same to all.
Never more savagely did the lioness,
forgetting her cubs, range across the plains,
nor did deformed bears usually yield so many corpses and havoc
throughout the forests; then the savage boar, then the wickedest tiger;
alas! ill then for one who wanders alone in the fields of Libya.
========================================

nonne uides ut tota tremor pertemptet equorum  &             250
corpora, si tantum notas odor attulit auras?&
ac neque eos iam frena uirum neque uerbera saeua,&

aequora; nec miseri possunt reuocare parentes,&
nec moritura super crudeli funere uirgo.
========================================
Don't you see how a tremor shakes the horse's body,
when some such odor is wafted in on familiar breezes?
And no longer do either man's restraints or savage whips,
nor boulders or hollow rocks hold him back,
or confining rivers that sweep mountains away with a twisting wave.
The great Sabine boar charges in and sharpens its tusks
and paws at the earth to dig it up, rubs his ribs on trees
and hither and thither hardens its shoulders against wounds.
What of the young man, in whose bones harsh love twirls a great flame?
Truly, while storms tear through the troubled night
he swims too late in the gloomy sea, upon which
the vast portal of heaven thunders and the waves,
dashed on boulders, cry out in protest;
his wretched parents can not call him back,
nor can the maid, soon to die upon his cruel pyre.
========================================

========================================
What of Bacchus' mottled lynxes or the shrewd race of wolves and dogs?
What of the battles that peace-loving stags do give?
Certainly, the frenzy of mares in heat is remarked above all;
and Venus herself gave them purpose, when Glaucus of Potniae's
four-horse team destroyed his limbs with their jaws.
Love leads them across Mt Ida and the rushing Ascanius River;
they surmount mountains and swim across rivers.
And at once with their inward marrows burning as if lit by a flame
(more so in the spring, since heat returns to the bones in the spring), they all,
with faces turned into the West Wind, stand on high cliffs,
and sniff light breezes and, oftimes pregnant by the wind
with nary a mate (wonderous to tell),
they scatter across stones and rocks and deep valleys,
not toward your rising, East Wind, and not towards the sun's,
but to the North and Northwest, or from where the blackest South Wind
is born and darkens the sky with rainy cold.
========================================

========================================
Here at last, the heat-discharge that herdsmen call 'horse-madness' in truth,
the slimy poison dripping from the mares' vulvas,
this discharge, that often evil stepmothers gather
and mix with herbs and not harmless words.

But meanwhile it flies, time, irrecoverable, flies,
and passes us, caught by every love-charm, by.
That's enough for herds: another part of care remains,
to consider the woolly flocks and shaggy goats;
this toil, look for praise from this, steadfast herdsmen.
And I have no doubt how hard it'd be to conquer this with words,
and lay this honor on such narrow matters;
but sweet love carries me off across the steep deserts of Parnasus;
it delights me to walk unceasingly where no earlier track
turns down a gentle slope towards the Castalian fountain.
Now, revered Pales, I needs must shout out in a loud voice.
========================================

Incipiens stabulis edico in mollibus herbam  &             295

========================================
First off, I proclaim that sheep graze on grass
in movable sheds, until leafy summer is restored anon,
and to spread much straw and bundles of ferns
on the hard soil, lest icy cold should harm
the tender flock and bring them mange and nasty foot-gout.
Moving on, I tell you to give goats enough leafy arbutus
and to make fresh streams  available to them,
and turn their shelters from the winter winds
and face them to the noontime sun,
in the season when frigid Aquarius sets
and rains down dew on the last part of the year.
These goats too must be seen as no trifling concern for us,
nor will they be of less use, however much Milesian fleeces
are sold for, dyed with Tyrian reds.
They give more frequent offspring, and plenty of bountiful milk;
however much the milk pail foamed from an emptied udder,
the more will happy streams flow from squeezed teats.
========================================

nec minus interea barbas incanaque menta&

========================================
And meanwhile they still clip the beards and hoary chins
and long bristles of the Cinyphian billy-goat
for use in camp and for wretched sailors' garments.
Indeed they graze on woods and the summits of Lycaeus,
and bristling brambles and thorns that love steep places,
and the nanny goats return to remembered shelters and lead their young
and can barely clear the thresholds with their swollen udders.
Therefore you'll turn the ice and snowy winds aside with every zeal,
despite how little is their mortal need for care,
and cheerfully bring nourishment and brushwood fodder,
and not shut the haylofts all the winter long.
========================================

At uero Zephyris cum laeta uocantibus aestas&

========================================
But truly when the west winds call and joyful summer
sends both flocks to woodland glades and pastures, 
let us first graze cool fields, while the morning is new,
under the Morning Star, when the grass is white with dew,
for dew on tender grass is most pleasing to the herd.
Then, when the fourth hour gathers heaven's thirst
and quarrelsome cicadas rend the trees with song,
I'll order flocks to wells or alpine lakes 
to drink the water poured in troughs of oak.
But seek a shady valley in the midday heat,
wherever Jove's great oak with ancient strength
spreads its vast branches, or wherever sacred shade
lies near a dark woodland, thick with scarlet oaks;
then water them once more and feed them again 
until the setting of the sun, when cool Evening moderates the air,
and the dewy moon restores the woodland glades,
and river-banks resound with a kingfisher's song, brambles with a finch's.
========================================

Quid tibi pastores Libyae, quid pascua uersu&

quaque redit medium Rhodope porrecta sub axem.
========================================
Why should I tell you about Libyan shepherds,
who live on the pastures in a scraggly line of scattered tents?
The herd often grazes day and night for months at a time
in the boundless deserts with no fixed abode:
so much of the plain lies ahead.
The African herdsman carries everything with him,
hearth and home and arms, Spartan dog and Cretan quiver;
not unlike the keen Roman with his own arms
as he takes to the road under a heavy pack, and
once his camp is pitched stands in the column, waiting for the enemy.

But not so for the Scythian tribes and Lake Maeotis,
where the muddy Danube churns up yellow sand,
or where the Thracian mountains turn, stretched out under the open sky.
========================================

illic clausa tenent stabulis armenta, neque ullae&
aut herbae campo apparent aut arbore frondes;&
sed iacet aggeribus niueis informis et alto&

semper hiems, semper spirantes frigora Cauri;&

stiriaque impexis induruit horrida barbis.
========================================
There they keep the herds shut up in barns, and don't
give them either grass from the field or leaves from the trees;
but the earth lies in snowy formless heaps 
and far and wide snow rises as deep as seven ells.
Ever winter, with the Northwest winds always blowing cold;
Sun never ever dispels the pale green shadows then,
not while he drives his horses across the upper air,
nor when his chariot plunges down, bathed in Ocean's red.
Sudden crusts of ice harden on the flowing stream,
and the wave now carries iron wheels upon its back,
as hospitable now to broad wagons as it was before to ships;
brass jars often burst, and garments stiffen on the body,
they chop up wine, that once was liquid, with axes,
whole pools turn to solid ice,
and shaggy icicles harden on uncombed beards.
========================================

interea toto non setius aere ningit:&
intereunt pecudes, stant circumfusa pruinis&

aduoluere focis ulmos ignique dedere.
========================================
Meanwhile the whole sky is filled with snow:
cattle perish, the large bodies of oxen stand 
covered in hoar-frost, and herds of deer huddle numbly
under this new weight, with the tips of their horns barely visible.
It's not hunting dogs or nets or red feathers
that drive them, shaking with dread,
but, as they vainly thrust their breasts against a mountain of snow,
braying deeply, men cut them down with iron in close combat.
They strike and, happy, carry the meat home with a great shouting.
Those men take their rest safe in caves deep under the earth,
collecting oak trunks and entire elm trees,
rolling them to their hearth and giving them to the fire.
========================================

hic noctem ludo ducunt, et pocula laeti&
fermento atque acidis imitantur uitea sorbis.  &             380

et pecudum fuluis uelatur corpora saetis.&
      Si tibi lanitium curae, primum aspera silua&

continuoque greges uillis lege mollibus albos.&
illum autem, quamuis aries sit candidus ipse,&
nigra subest udo tantum cui lingua palato,&
reice, ne maculis infuscet uellera pullis&

munere sic niueo lanae, si credere dignum est,&
Pan deus Arcadiae captam te, Luna, fefellit&
in nemora alta uocans; nec tu aspernata uocantem.
========================================
Here they spend the night in games, and mimic drinking wine,
joyful with beer and service-berry cider.
So, looked down on by the arctic Dipper's seven oxen-stars,
this strong unruly tribe is buffeted by the wind from the Riphaean Mountains,
and they wrap their bodies in tawny animal pelts.

If your concern is for wool, first off, get rid of jagged bushes 
and burr-plants; and avoid rich fodder;
and start by choosing white flocks with soft shaggy pelts.
But reject the ram that hides a black tongue in his wet mouth,
even though he be bright white himself,
and look for another in the abundant field,
lest he mar his progeny's fleeces with dark spots.
Thus with a snow-white gift of wool, if it is to be believed,
Pan, the god of Arcadia, deceived and caught you, Luna,
calling you into the deep woods; and you didn't scorn the summons.
========================================

At cui lactis amor, cytisum lotosque frequentis&

et salis occultum referunt in lacte saporem.&
multi etiam excretos prohibent a matribus haedos,&
primaque ferratis praefigunt ora capistris.&
quod surgente die mulsere horisque diurnis,  &             400

      Nec tibi cura canum fuerit postrema, sed una&

pasce sero pingui. numquam custodibus illis&
nocturnum stabulis furem incursusque luporum&
aut impacatos a tergo horrebis Hiberos.
========================================
But for one who loves milk, let him carry trefoil and medick shrub
and briny grass with his own hands over and over again to their mangers:
For from this they love water more, and their udders swell more
and the taste of salt comes back, hidden in their milk.
Too, many separate the new-born kids from their dams,
and from the first fix iron-clad halters over their muzzles.
What milk these men get at daybreak and in hours of day,
they press into cheese at night; what's got at sunset or in darkness,
at dawn: they carry it away in wicker baskets (the shepherd goes to town),
or rub it with a bit of salt and store it away for winter.

And last but not least, you whose concern will be for hounds,
but feed both swift Spartan puppies and fierce Molessian hounds
on fattening whey.  With these guard dogs
you'll never fear a thief in the night or a raid by wolves
on your stables or plundering Spaniards at your back.
========================================

saepe etiam cursu timidos agitabis onagros,&

deice! iamque fuga timidum caput abdidit alte,&
cum medii nexus extremaeque agmina caudae&

========================================
Often too, you'll frighten wild asses into flight,
and hunt the hare and fallow deer with dogs;
often you'll drive boars from their woodland wallowing holes
with the baying of your hunting dogs, and with a clamor
chase the huge stag across high mountains and into a net.

Learn to burn sweet-scented cedar in the stables
and drive foul sea-serpents out with fumes of galbanum.
Often a viper, ill to touch, would hide under never-cleaned stalls
and, terrified, would flee the light of day,
or a snake, used to climbing in the shadow of a roof
and splashing venom (the bitter plague of oxen) on cattle, hugged the ground.
Seize stones in your hand, seize sticks, shepherd,
and destroy him as he raises threats and swells his hissing head!
And now in flight he hides his timid head deep down,
as his twining middle and his driving tail-tip ease,
his endmost loop slowly drags his coils.
========================================

est etiam ille malus Calabris in saltibus anguis  &             425

========================================
Also in the woodlands of Calabria there's that evil snake with a scaly back
that coils up to show a long belly with large spots,
and, when any rivers swell with springs and
drip with the wet of the earth and with the rainy South Wind,
it inhabits pools and dwelling here and wickedly
fills its black gullet with fish and talkative frogs;
after the marsh is burnt up and the country gapes open from the heat,
it leaps out into dry land, and whirling its fiery eyes,
rages across fields and hopeless with thirst and terrified by the heat.
It wouldn't agree with me then to take a nap under the sky
or to lie down on my back in the grass of a shady meadow,
as it slithers, bright and fresh with youth, with old skin shed,
or leaving its young or eggs under shelter,
rearing towards the sun and darts its triply forked tongue from its mouth.
========================================

Morborum quoque te causas et signa docebo.   &            440

========================================
Likewise, I'll teach you the causes and signs of diseases.
Nasty scabies is a trial for sheep, when a cold rain
and a frightful winter with white frost has ridden them to the quick,
or a filthy sweat has clung to the shorn sheep,
and prickly thorn-bushes have cut their bodies.
Therefore the masters bathe each flock in fresh running water,
and the ram breaks loose and is launched down the river,
then is immersed in the sea with its wet shaggy fleece,
or they rub the shorn bodies with bitter olive dregs
and mix an anointment of lead oxide and native sulfur
and pitchy wine from Ida and beeswax softened with oil
and sea-onion and rank hellebore and black bitumen.
Yet the fortune of the labors at hand is no greater
than if one at most could cut open a sore's mouth with a knife:
the blemish is nourished and thrives from being covered,
so long as the shepherd refuses to apply healing hands to the wounds
and sits still, asking the gods for better signs.
========================================

quin etiam, ima dolor balantum lapsus ad ossa&
cum furit atque artus depascitur arida febris,&

pascentem et serae solam decedere nocti—&
continuo culpam ferro compesce, priusquam&
dira per incautum serpant contagia uulgus.
========================================
And when the bleater's suffering has sunk deep within bones
and rages there, and the joints are eaten away by a dry fever,
it is useful to draw the kindled heat out and
to cut the pulsing vein between the cloven hooves,
the Bisaltians are wont to act this way and bitter Gelonus
as he flees to Thrace and the Getaean deserts,
and drinks milk mixed with the blood of horses.
Were you to see in the distance one often slip into a gentle shadow 
or lazily pluck at the grass tips or trail at the end of the flock,
or to lie down in the middle of the field
and retire from grazing late and alone -
at once curb the fault with your knife, before
fearsome contagions creep through your heedless herd.
========================================

non tam creber agens hiemem ruit aequore turbo    &           470
quam multae pecudum pestes. nec singula morbi&
corpora corripiunt, sed tota aestiua repente,&
spemque gregemque simul cunctamque ab origine gentem.&
tum sciat, aerias Alpis et Norica si quis&
castella in tumulis et Iapydis arua Timaui   &            475
nunc quoque post tanto uideat, desertaque regna&
pastorum et longe saltus lateque uacantis.&
      Hic quondam morbo caeli miseranda coorta est&
tempestas totoque autumni incanduit aestu&
et genus omne neci pecudum dedit, omne ferarum,  &             480
corrupitque lacus, infecit pabula tabo.&
nec uia mortis erat simplex; sed ubi ignea uenis&
omnibus acta sitis miseros adduxerat artus,&
rursus abundabat fluidus liquor omniaque in se&
ossa minutatim morbo conlapsa trahebat.               485
========================================
The ever driving whirlwind pushing winter in from the sea
is not as bad as the many plagues of sheep. And diseases don't carry
bodies off one by one, but suddenly in the summer feeding grounds,
at once both hope and flock and every generation from the start.
Then let him know, if anyone should see the airy Alps and
hilltop fortresses of Noricum and the Iapydian fields of Timavus
now after so much time, realms bereft
of shepherds and empty woodlands far and wide.

At one time here, a piteous season rose from a disordered sky
and burned with all the heat of autumn 
and sent each sort of livestock, and wild beast, to their death.
It contaminated lakes and infected fodder with gore.
And the path to death was not straightforward;
but with fire coursing through all the veins
thirst pulled the wretched limbs tight,
in turn liquid putrefaction built up and crushed all the bones inside
that had bit by bit fallen apart from the sickness.
========================================

saepe in honore deum medio stans hostia ad aram,&
lanea dum niuea circumdatur infula uitta,&
inter cunctantis cecidit moribunda ministros;&
aut si quam ferro mactauerat ante sacerdos,&
inde neque impositis ardent altaria fibris,  &             490
nec responsa potest consultus reddere uates,&
ac uix suppositi tinguntur sanguine cultri&
summaque ieiuna sanie infuscatur harena.&
hinc laetis uituli uulgo moriuntur in herbis&
et dulcis animas plena ad praesepia reddunt; &              495
hinc canibus blandis rabies uenit, et quatit aegros&
tussis anhela sues ac faucibus angit obesis.
========================================
Often a victim, standing at the altar in the middle of a sacrifice
with a snow-white woolen fillet bound round its head,
falls and dies amidst the slow-moving attendants;
or if one had managed to slit its throat in front of the priests,
the altar doesn't kindle when the entrails are placed on it,
nor can a seer who is consulted return any answers,
and the knives used are barely stained with blood
and only the top of the sand is darkened with meager blood.
From this the herd of calves die in lush grass
and return their sweet souls at full mangers;
from this madness comes to gentle dogs and
a heaving cough shakes sick pigs and chokes their swollen throats.
========================================

labitur infelix studiorum atque immemor herbae&
uictor equus fontisque auertitur et pede terram&
crebra ferit; demissae aures, incertus ibidem      &         500
sudor et ille quidem morituris frigidus; aret&
pellis et ad tactum tractanti dura resistit.&
haec ante exitium primis dant signa diebus:&
sin in processu coepit crudescere morbus,&
tum uero ardentes oculi atque attractus ab alto  &             505
spiritus, interdum gemitu grauis, imaque longo&
ilia singultu tendunt, it naribus ater&
sanguis, et obsessas fauces premit aspera lingua.&
profuit inserto latices infundere cornu&
Lenaeos; ea uisa salus morientibus una.               510
========================================
A winning racehorse sinks, failing in his course and,
forgetful of grass, turns away from springs
and paws at the earth again and again.
His ears droop too, and a waivering sweat
turns to cold when he's near death.
His hide is dry and hard and stiff to the touch.
In the days before death they first give these signs:
but if the sickness progesses and grows worse,
then their eyes burn and their breath is deeply drawn,
now and then with heavy groaning, and from deep inside 
they're wracked with long gasps, black blood runs from their nostrils,
and rough tongues block clogged throats.
It's helpful to thrust in a horn and pour the liquid of Bacchus in;
it seems the sole salvation for the dying.
========================================

mox erat hoc ipsum exitio, furiisque referti&
ardebant, ipsique suos iam morte sub aegra&
(di meliora piis, erroremque hostibus illum!)&
discissos nudis laniabant dentibus artus.&
ecce autem duro fumans sub uomere taurus  &             515
concidit et mixtum spumis uomit ore cruorem&
extremosque ciet gemitus. it tristis arator&
maerentem abiungens fraterna morte iuuencum,&
atque opere in medio defixa reliquit aratra.&
non umbrae altorum nemorum, non mollia possunt  &             520
prata mouere animum, non qui per saxa uolutus&
purior electro campum petit amnis; at ima&
soluuntur latera, atque oculos stupor urget inertis&
ad terramque fluit deuexo pondere ceruix.
========================================
This itself soon led to death, and they burned, filled with fury,
and they themselves, just before their disease-ridden demise,
(Gods, give better things to pious men, and such madness to their enemies.)
in turn ripped their torn limbs with their bare teeth.
But behold, the bull steaming under the stern plowshare
falls and vomits frothy blood from its mouth
and a groan shakes its extremities.  The sorrowful plowman walks on,
unyoking the mourning young bull from its brother's corpse,
and in the middle of the toil leaves the motionless plow behind.
Neither the forest's deep shade nor pleasant meadows can
shift its soul, nor a river that, purer than amber,
rolls over stones and reaches the plain; and its inmost
flanks are loosened, and stupor presses its helpless eyes
and its neck droops to the earth with a sinking burden.
========================================

quid labor aut benefacta iuuant? quid uomere terras    &   525
inuertisse grauis? atqui non Massica Bacchi&
munera, non illis epulae nocuere repostae:&
frondibus et uictu pascuntur simplicis herbae,&
pocula sunt fontes liquidi atque exercita cursu&
flumina, nec somnos abrumpit cura salubris.  &             530
tempore non alio dicunt regionibus illis&
quaesitas ad sacra boues Iunonis et uris&
imparibus ductos alta ad donaria currus.&
ergo aegre rastris terram rimantur, et ipsis&
unguibus infodiunt fruges, montisque per altos &           535
contenta ceruice trahunt stridentia plaustra.&
non lupus insidias explorat ouilia circum&
nec gregibus nocturnus obambulat: acrior illum&
cura domat; timidi dammae ceruique fugaces&
nunc interque canes et circum tecta uagantur.              540
========================================
What toil or benefits/good deeds are helpful?
What to turn heavy earth with a plowshare?
but not Bacchus' Club Massica services/gifts,
not toby those the remote banquets to harm:
with leaves and nourishment they are fed of simple grass,
cups are liquid/flowing springs and trained streams in the course,
and worry does not interrupt healthful sleep.
in no other time they say toby those regions
>sought outFF to sacred things Juno's cattle and
carts drawn by mismatched wild oxen to lofty temple chambers.
Therfore with drag-hoes they barely scratch the earth,
and with claws themselves they bury crops and they
drag the creaking wagons with neck stretched out across high mountains.
not a wolf tests out treachery around the sheepfolds
nor the nocturnalM walks among the flocks:
more bitter worry masters that one;
of timidM red-deer and swift stags
wander now, both among the dogs and around the houses.
