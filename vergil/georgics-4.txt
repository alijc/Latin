Protinus aerii mellis caelestia dona&
exsequar: hanc etiam, Maecenas, adspice partem.&
Admiranda tibi levium spectacula rerum&
magnanimosque duces totiusque ordine gentis&
mores et studia et populos et proelia dicam. &              5
In tenui labor; at tenuis non gloria, si quem&
numina laeva sinunt auditque vocatus Apollo.&

Principio sedes apibus statioque petenda,&
quo neque sit ventis aditus—nam pabula venti&
ferre domum prohibent—neque oves haedique petulci    &           10
floribus insultent aut errans bucula campo&
decutiat rorem et surgentes atterat herbas.&
Absint et picti squalentia terga lacerti&
pinguibus a stabulis meropesque aliaeque volucres&
et manibus Procne pectus signata cruentis;   &            15
omnia nam late vastant ipsasque volantes&
ore ferunt dulcem nidis immitibus escam.
========================================

I'll go on to describe the heavenly gifts of air-borne honey:
look on this section too, Maecenas.
I'll relate to you remarkable spectacles of trivial matters
and highminded leaders and all the nations in order -
their customs and endeavors and peoples and battles.
The work is trifling; but renown is not in triflings, if 
the unfavorable gods allow, and Apollo, summoned, hears.

First off, in seeking a spot for a home and station for your bees,
let it be where the wind doesn't reach - for the winds keep them
from bringing food home - and not where sheep and butting kids
stomp the flowers or a heifer wandering on the field
might dislodge the dew and wear away the growing grass.
There should be no painted lizards' scaly backs
from fertile stables and bee-eaters and other birds
and Procne stained upon her breast with bloody hands;
for all flying things lay waste far and near
and with their beaks bear sweet meat to their cruel nests.
