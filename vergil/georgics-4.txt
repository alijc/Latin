Protinus aerii mellis caelestia dona&
exsequar: hanc etiam, Maecenas, adspice partem.&
Admiranda tibi levium spectacula rerum&
magnanimosque duces totiusque ordine gentis&
mores et studia et populos et proelia dicam. &              5
In tenui labor; at tenuis non gloria, si quem&
numina laeva sinunt auditque vocatus Apollo.&

Principio sedes apibus statioque petenda,&
quo neque sit ventis aditus—nam pabula venti&
ferre domum prohibent—neque oves haedique petulci    &           10
floribus insultent aut errans bucula campo&
decutiat rorem et surgentes atterat herbas.&
Absint et picti squalentia terga lacerti&
pinguibus a stabulis meropesque aliaeque volucres&
et manibus Procne pectus signata cruentis;   &            15
omnia nam late vastant ipsasque volantes&
ore ferunt dulcem nidis immitibus escam.
========================================

I'll go on to describe the heaven-sent gift of honey:
look on this section too, Maecenas.
I'll relate to you remarkable spectacles of trivial matters
and high-minded leaders and of an entire nation -
its customs and endeavors and peoples and battles in order.
The work is trifling; but not its renown, if 
the unfavorable gods allow it, and Apollo, summoned, hears.

First off, in seeking the place for a home for your bees,
let it be where the wind doesn't reach - for wind keeps them
from bringing food home - and not where sheep and butting kids
stomp the flowers or a wandering heifer might dislodge the dew
from the field and wear away the growing grass.
Keep their rich cells free of painted lizards' scaly backs
and bee-eaters and other birds
and Procne, with her breast stained with bloody hands;
for all flying things lay waste far and near
and with their beaks bear sweet meat to their cruel nests.
========================================

At liquidi fontes et stagna virentia musco&
adsint et tenuis fugiens per gramina rivus,&
palmaque vestibulum aut ingens oleaster inumbret,&               20
ut, cum prima novi ducent examina reges&
vere suo ludetque favis emissa iuventus,&
vicina invitet decedere ripa calori,&
obviaque hospitiis teneat frondentibus arbos.&
In medium, seu stabit iners seu profluet umor,  &             25
transversas salices et grandia conice saxa,&
pontibus ut crebris possint consistere et alas&
pandere ad aestivum solem, si forte morantes&
sparserit aut praeceps Neptuno immerserit Eurus.
========================================
But let clear springs and pools, green with moss, be nearby,
and with a shallow brook running through the grass,
and let a palm or a large oleaster shade the entrance,
so that, when the young kings(!) lead the first swarms out
in the spring and the young, discharged from the honeycombs,
play, a nearby river bank may invite them to come out of the heat,
and a handy tree may offer leafy hospitality.
In the middle of the water, whether stagnant or flowing,
throw down willow branches and large rocks,
so that the bees can stand on thick-set bridges and
spread their wings to the summer sun, if by chance 
the East Wind dispersed them in their loitering
or plunged them headlong into the wet.
========================================

Haec circum casiae virides et olentia late  &             30
serpylla et graviter spirantis copia thymbrae&
floreat inriguumque bibant violaria fontem.&
Ipsa autem, seu corticibus tibi suta cavatis,&
seu lento fuerint alvaria vimine texta,&
angustos habeant aditus: nam frigore mella      &         35
cogit hiems, eademque calor liquefacta remittit.&
Utraque vis apibus pariter metuenda; neque illae&
nequiquam in tectis certatim tenuia cera&
spiramenta linunt fucoque et floribus oras&
explent collectumque haec ipsa ad munera gluten &              40
et visco et Phrygiae servant pice lentius Idae.
========================================
Around this spot should be wide-spread green thyme and scented daphne
and an abundance of strongly scented winter savory should blossom,
and violets should drink from a refreshing spring.
But your hives themselves, whether sewn from hollow bark
or woven from clinging shoots, should have narrow entrances:
for in the cold winter the honey congeals, and likewise heat turns it liquid.
Either of these things are equally dreadful for bees; and not for nothing
do they zealously plaster the crevices on their roofs
with a thin layer of beeswax
and stuff the edges with propolis and blossoms 
and they keep bee-glue they've collected for this purpose
that's even stickier than both bird-lime and
the pitch from Mount Ida in Phrygia.
========================================

Saepe etiam effossis, si vera est fama, latebris&
sub terra fovere larem, penitusque repertae&
pumicibusque cavis exesaeque arboris antro.&
Tu tamen et levi rimosa cubilia limo  &             45
ungue fovens circum et raras superinice frondes.&
Neu propius tectis taxum sine, neve rubentes&
ure foco cancros, altae neu crede paludi,&
aut ubi odor caeni gravis aut ubi concava pulsu&
saxa sonant vocisque offensa resultat imago.  &             50

Quod superest, ubi pulsam hiemem sol aureus egit&
sub terras caelumque aestiva luce reclusit,&
illae continuo saltus silvasque peragrant&
purpureosque metunt flores et flumina libant&
summa leves. Hinc nescio qua dulcedine laetae  &             55
progeniem nidosque fovent, hinc arte recentes&
excudunt ceras et mella tenacia fingunt.
========================================
Indeed, if the report is true,
they are often found to keep their home warm
deep within underground burrows
and in caves of pumice stone and in hollow trees.
Even still, smooth mud onto their fissured hives
to keep them warm, and scatter loose leaves on that.
And don't plant yew-trees too close to their hives
or burn red crabs in your hearth. Don't trust the deep swamp,
or where there's a stink of a heavy mire or where hollow rocks resound
from a stroke and the sound's offended echo reverberates.

What is more, when the golden sun has driven banished winter
underground and has opened the sky with the light of summer,
the bees immediately scour the woodlands and forests.
They harvest the purple flowers and gently sip from the surface of streams.
I know not how the bees, happy with sweetness,
warm their progeny and nests after that, or 
skillfully fashion fresh wax and mold tenacious honey.
========================================

Hinc ubi iam emissum caveis ad sidera caeli&
nare per aestatem liquidam suspexeris agmen&
obscuramque trahi vento mirabere nubem,  &             60
contemplator: aquas dulces et frondea semper&
tecta petunt. Huc tu iussos adsperge sapores,&
trita melisphylla et cerinthae ignobile gramen,&
tinnitusque cie et Matris quate cymbala circum.&
ipsae consident medicatis sedibus, ipsae  &             65
intima more suo sese in cunabula condent.&

Sin autem ad pugnam exierint, nam saepe duobus&
regibus incessit magno discordia motu,&
continuoque animos vulgi et trepidantia bello&
corda licet longe praesciscere; namque morantes   &            70
Martius ille aeris rauci canor increpat et vox&
auditur fractos sonitus imitata tubarum;&
tum trepidae inter se coeunt pennisque coruscant&
spiculaque exacuunt rostris aptantque lacertos&
et circa regem atque ipsa ad praetoria densae   &            75
miscentur magnisque vocant clamoribus hostem.
========================================
On this account when you look up to see the column,
just now expelled from the beehives,
floating up to heaven's stars across the clear summer sky,
observing this, you'll wonder at the dark cloud dragged about on the wind:
they always make for sweet waters and leafy homes.
Smear the prescribed scents, common balm and lowly honeywort herb,
where you want them to light,
and call up jingling and shake the Mother's cymbals round about.
The bees themselves will settle on the seats thus anointed,
by their inmost instinct they'll insert themselves into hives.

But if they have risen up for battle, for when there are two
kings discord often attacks with a great commotion,
you may discern at once from afar the hearts and minds of the throng,
trembling for war; for that well known song of Mars of raucous air
rebukes those who tarry and a voice is heard like the broken sounds of bugles;
then the agitated bees unite among themselves and shake their wings
and sharpen their stingers on their beaks and adjust their arms
and around the king and at his very cell are densely joined
and with great clamors call on the enemy.
========================================

Ergo ubi ver nactae sudum camposque patentes,&
erumpunt portis; concurritur, aethere in alto&
fit sonitus, magnum mixtae glomerantur in orbem&
praecipitesque cadunt; non densior aëre grando,  &             80
nec de concussa tantum pluit ilice glandis.&
ipsi per medias acies insignibus alis&
ingentes animos angusto in pectore versant,&
usque adeo obnixi non cedere, dum gravis aut hos&
aut hos versa fuga victor dare terga subegit.  &             85
Hi motus animorum atque haec certamina tanta&
pulveris exigui iactu compressa quiescent.&
Verum ubi ductores acie revocaveris ambo,&
deterior qui visus, eum, ne prodigus obsit,&
dede neci; melior vacua sine regnet in aula.               90
========================================
And so, when the bees get fine spring weather and open plains,
they burst from their doors; battle is joined,
a din commences in the high upper air,
the aroused bees glob into a huge melee
and fall headlong; hail falling from the sky is no denser,
nor are acorns raining from a shaken oak.
The kings themselves whirl through the midst of the battle
on conspicuous wings, showing great courage with their narrow breasts,
determined to cede no ground, until the oppressing victor compels
either these or those to turn their backs in flight.
These stirrings of the soul and these so great contests
will quiet down, suppressed by a cast of meager dust.
Indeed, after you call both commanders back from the battle line,
the one that seems inferior, consign him to death, to keep the hive from harm;
let the better one reign in an empty hall.
========================================

Alter erit maculis auro squalentibus ardens;&
nam duo sunt genera: hic melior, insignis et ore&
et rutilis clarus squamis, ille horridus alter&
desidia latamque trahens inglorius alvum.&

Ut binae regum facies, ita corpora plebis. &              95
Namque aliae turpes horrent, ceu pulvere ab alto&
cum venit et sicco terram spuit ore viator&
aridus; elucent aliae et fulgore coruscant&
ardentes auro et paribus lita corpora guttis.&
Haec potior suboles, hinc caeli tempore certo  &             100
dulcia mella premes, nec tantum dulcia, quantum&
et liquida et durum Bacchi domitura saporem.
========================================
One will shine with spots of scaly gold;
for there are two sorts: this one is better, with a striking head
and bright with reddish scales, that other one shaggy
from its laziness and unadorned, dragging its fat belly.

As the two kings' faces are, so are the workers' bodies.
For some are rough and ugly, like when a thirsty traveler
comes out of a column of dust and spits dirt from his parched mouth;
while others shine and flash with brilliance,
their gleaming bodies overlaid with gold and matching spots.
This is the superior breed, in heaven's season
you'll surely press sweet honey from these - not so much sweet as 
pure, and bound to tame Bacchus' rough taste.
========================================

At cum incerta volant caeloque examina ludunt&
contemnuntque favos et frigida tecta relinquunt,&
instabiles animos ludo prohibebis inani.   &            105
Nec magnus prohibere labor: tu regibus alas&
eripe; non illis quisquam cunctantibus altum&
ire iter aut castris audebit vellere signa.&
Invitent croceis halantes floribus horti&
et custos furum atque avium cum falce saligna   &            110
Hellespontiaci servet tutela Priapi.&
Ipse thymum pinosque ferens de montibus altis&
tecta serat late circum, cui talia curae;&
ipse labore manum duro terat, ipse feraces&
figat humo plantas et amicos inriget imbres.               115
========================================
But when the swarms flitter and fly and sport in the sky
and scorn their honeycombs and leave their homes cold,
you'll need to restrain their unsteady minds from foolish play.
It's no great labor to prevent it: pull the kings' wings off;
with those hesitating to rise no-one else will
dare to strike camp and hit the road.
Let gardens fragrant with yellow flowers invite them
and let the watchfulness of Priapus of Hellespont
protect them from thieves and birds, guarding them with his willow-blade.
Let the man who has them in his care himself bear thyme and pine
boughs from the high mountains and wreathe the hives widely about;
let he himself wear out his hand with hard toil,
let he himself fix fertile cuttings in the ground
and irrigate them with friendly showers.
========================================

Atque equidem, extremo ni iam sub fine laborum&
vela traham et terris festinem advertere proram,&
forsitan et, pingues hortos quae cura colendi&
ornaret, canerem, biferique rosaria Paesti,&
quoque modo potis gauderent intiba rivis   &             120
et virides apio ripae, tortusque per herbam&
cresceret in ventrem cucumis; nec sera comantem&
narcissum aut flexi tacuissem vimen acanthi&
pallentesque hederas et amantes litora myrtos.&
Namque sub Oebaliae memini me turribus arcis,&               125
qua niger umectat flaventia culta Galaesus,&
Corycium vidisse senem, cui pauca relicti&
iugera ruris erant, nec fertilis illa iuvencis&
nec pecori opportuna seges nec commoda Baccho.
========================================
But in all events, if I were not already at the utmost limit of my toil,
hauling on my sails and hastening to steer my prow towards land,
then perhaps I'd sing of rich gardens, adorned by careful cultivation,
and Paestum's rosegardens, that bloom twice a year,
of how endives rejoice in drinking from brooks
and green banks in parsley, and a cucumber, winding through grass,
growing on its belly; and not keep still about the late-blooming
plumed narcissus or a twig of curled hellebore
or pale green ivies or shore-loving myrtles.
For I'm minded of a cidadel under Oebalia's towers,
where the black Galaesus wets golden fields,
where I saw an old Corycian who held a few acres
of an abandoned farm, and those fields neither fruitful for cows
nor useful for flocks nor suitable for wine.
========================================

Hic rarum tamen in dumis olus albaque circum     &           130
lilia verbenasque premens vescumque papaver&
regum aequabat opes animis seraque revertens&
nocte domum dapibus mensas onerabat inemptis.&
Primus vere rosam atque autumno carpere poma,&
et cum tristis hiems etiamnum frigore saxa   &            135
rumperet et glacie cursus frenaret aquarum,&
ille comam mollis iam tondebat hyacinthi&
aestatem increpitans seram Zephyrosque morantes.&
Ergo apibus fetis idem atque examine multo&
primus abundare et spumantia cogere pressis  &             140
mella favis; illi tiliae atque uberrima pinus,&
quotque in flore novo pomis se fertilis arbos&
induerat, totidem autumno matura tenebat.&
Ille etiam seras in versum distulit ulmos&
eduramque pirum et spinos iam pruna ferentes &              145
iamque ministrantem platanum potantibus umbras.
========================================
Nevertheless this man, who planted vegetables scattered in brambles
and white lilies and verbenas and tiny poppy seeds around,
would return home late in the evening, loading his table with unbought feasts,
as proud as if he had the wealth of kings.
He was the first to harvest roses in the spring and fruit in the fall,
and even when gloomy winter cracked stones with the cold
and blocked the course of streams with ice,
he trimmed the iris' leaves, already tender,
scolding the tardy summer and the loitering West Wind.
And so this man was the first to have a great abundant swarm of fecund bees
and the first to press honeycombs and collect the foaming honey;
his lime-trees and his pines abounded,
and however much his orchard had clothed itself in spring flowers,
that much abundant fruit would it carry, ripe, in autumn.
Then too, he transplanted late-flowering elms into lines,
hardy pear-trees and sloe-trees, bearing already,
and the plane-tree already furnishing shade for those who drink.
========================================

Verum haec ipse equidem spatiis exclusus iniquis&
praetereo atque aliis post me memoranda relinquo.&

Nunc age, naturas apibus quas Iuppiter ipse&
addidit, expediam, pro qua mercede canoros   &            150
Curetum sonitus crepitantiaque aera secutae&
Dictaeo caeli regem pavere sub antro.&
Solae communes natos, consortia tecta&
urbis habent magnisque agitant sub legibus aevum,&
et patriam solae et certos novere penates,   &            155
venturaeque hiemis memores aestate laborem&
experiuntur et in medium quaesita reponunt.
========================================
Indeed, I myself leave these things out, for my part prevented by lack of time,
and leave them to be recounted by others after me.

Come now, I'll relate the natures that Jove himself attached to bees,
for whose reward they followed the Curetes'
melodious sounds and rattling coins
to feed the king of heaven in Dicte's cave.
Only they have children and homes in cities in common
and spend their lives under noble laws,
and only they know their native land and settled hearths,
and, mindful in summer of the coming of winter,
they endure toil and deposit their earnings in common. 
========================================

Namque aliae victu invigilant et foedere pacto&
exercentur agris; pars intra saepta domorum&
Narcissi lacrimam et lentum de cortice gluten  &             160
prima favis ponunt fundamina, deinde tenaces&
suspendunt ceras: aliae spem gentis adultos&
educunt fetus, aliae purissima mella&
stipant et liquido distendunt nectare cellas.&
Sunt quibus ad portas cecidit custodia sorti,  &             165
inque vicem speculantur aquas et nubila caeli&
aut onera accipiunt venientum aut agmine facto&
ignavum fucos pecus a praesepibus arcent.
========================================
For, indeed, some bees keep watch over their sustenance
and are employed in the fields under a stipulation;
while others set the first foundations for honeycombs
- the tears of Narcissus and sticky gum from tree bark -
within the enclosure of their home,
and from this suspend clinging wax:
some lead out the tribe's hope - their grown offspring,
while others pack the purest honey and swell the cells with clear nectar.
There are those to whom the lot fell to stand guard at the gates,
and in turn keep watch on clouds and waters of the sky
or accept incoming loads, or make a swarm and
drive the lazy herd of drones from the fold.
========================================

Fervet opus, redolentque thymo fragrantia mella.&
ac veluti lentis Cyclopes fulmina massis    &           170
cum properant, alii taurinis follibus auras&
accipiunt redduntque, alii stridentia tingunt&
aera lacu; gemit impositis incudibus Aetna;&
illi inter sese magna vi bracchia tollunt&
in numerum versantque tenaci forcipe ferrum:  &             175
non aliter, si parva licet componere magnis,&
Cecropias innatus apes amor urget habendi,&
munere quamque suo. Grandaevis oppida curae&
et munire favos et daedala fingere tecta.
========================================
The work is hot, and the honey smells of thyme.
And just as the Cyclopes hustle,
some with ox-hide bellows taking in air
and rendering thunderbolts from soft ore,
while others plunge hissing metal into a trough;
Etna groans under the anvils set on it;
among themselves they raise their arms in rhythm 
and with great strength turn the iron with tenacious tongs.
If one may match small things with great ones,
their innate love of having pushes the bees of Athens,
to each one's particular duty.  To the aged it is to care for the town -
to construct both honeycombs and well made homes.
========================================

At fessae multa referunt se nocte minores,  &             180
crura thymo plenae; pascuntur et arbuta passim&
et glaucas salices casiamque crocumque rubentem&
et pinguem tiliam et ferrugineos hyacinthos.&
Omnibus una quies operum, labor omnibus unus:&
mane ruunt portis; nusquam mora; rursus easdem &              185
vesper ubi e pastu tandem decedere campis&
admonuit, tum tecta petunt, tum corpora curant;&
fit sonitus, mussantque oras et limina circum.&
Post, ubi iam thalamis se composuere, siletur&
in noctem fessosque sopor suus occupat artus.               190
========================================
But the younger bees, weary, return home late at night,
having stuffed their legs with thyme; they feed far and wide on arbutus
and grayish willows and daphne and red-tinged crocus
and oily lime-tree and rust-colored hyacinths.
A single rest from work for all, a single toil for all:
at dawn they rush the gates: with no delay;
when evening at last prompts them to retire from foraging in the fields,
then they seek their home, then they care for their bodies;
a din arises, and they hum around their entrances and thresholds.
Later, after they've settled themselves in their bedrooms,
the night grows still and sleep overtakes their wearied limbs.
========================================

Nec vero a stabulis pluvia impendente recedunt&
longius aut credunt caelo adventantibus Euris,&
sed circum tutae sub moenibus urbis aquantur,&
excursusque breves temptant et saepe lapillos,&
ut cumbae instabiles fluctu iactante saburram,  &             195
tollunt, his sese per inania nubila librant.&
Illum adeo placuisse apibus mirabere morem,&
quod neque concubitu indulgent nec corpora segnes&
in Venerem solvunt aut fetus nixibus edunt:&
verum ipsae e foliis natos, e suavibus herbis &              200
ore legunt, ipsae regem parvosque Quirites&
sufficiunt aulasque et cerea regna refigunt.&
Saepe etiam duris errando in cotibus alas&
attrivere ultroque animam sub fasce dedere:&
tantus amor florum et generandi gloria mellis.               205
========================================
Nor indeed do they go very far from their dwellings when rain threatens
or trust the sky when the East Wind rises,
but get their water round about under the walls of their safe city,
and test out brief sallies and often pick up pebbles,
just as unstable skiffs in a tossing wave use ballast,
and balance themselves through empty clouds.
Thus far you'll marvel that that custom pleased the bees,
that they don't indulge in sex or release their sluggish bodies
into venery or bring forth their young through childbirth:
in truth they, by themselves, gather up children in their mouths
from leaves, from sweet herbs, by themselves they provide a king
and small citizens and make halls and waxen realm afresh.
Yet often in straying among the jagged rocks they wear away their wings
and freely give up their lives under their burdens:
such is their love for flowers and renown for making honey.
========================================

Ergo ipsas quamvis angusti terminus aevi&
excipiat, neque enim plus septima ducitur aestas,&
at genus immortale manet multosque per annos&
stat fortuna domus et avi numerantur avorum.&
Praeterea regem non sic Aegyptus et ingens   &            210
Lydia nec populi Parthorum aut Medus Hydaspes&
observant. Rege incolumi mens omnibus una est;&
amisso rupere fidem constructaque mella&
diripuere ipsae et crates solvere favorum.&
Ille operum custos, illum admirantur et omnes &              215
circumstant fremitu denso stipantque frequentes&
et saepe attollunt umeris et corpora bello&
obiectant pulchramque petunt per vulnera mortem.
========================================
Therefore even though the end of their short life may catch them -
for it's never prolonged past the seventh summer -
the immortal race remains and over many years
the fortune of the house stands and the ancestors of ancestors are added up.
Moreover, neither Egypt or immense Lydia nor the peoples of the Parthians
or the Median Hydaspes heed a king thus.
With a sound king there is a single mind for all;
when one is lost they break their loyalty and do themselves
destroy their stores of honey and undo the frameworks of their honeycombs.
They admire that keeper of works, and all crowd around him buzzing hoarsely
and attend him in great numbers and often lift him on their shoulders
and interpose their bodies in battle
and through their wounds seek a beautiful death.
========================================

His quidam signis atque haec exempla secuti&
esse apibus partem divinae mentis et haustus  &             220
aetherios dixere; deum namque ire per omnes&
terrasque tractusque maris caelumque profundum.&
Hinc pecudes, armenta, viros, genus omne ferarum,&
quemque sibi tenues nascentem arcessere vitas;&
scilicet huc reddi deinde ac resoluta referri &              225
omnia nec morti esse locum, sed viva volare&
sideris in numerum atque alto succedere caelo.&

Siquando sedem angustam servataque mella&
thesauris relines, prius haustu sparsus aquarum&
ora fove fumosque manu praetende sequaces.               230
========================================
And by these signs, those who follow these patterns have said
that bees possess a part of the divine mind and drink drafts of ether;
for god passes through all lands and regions of the sea and boundless heaven.
It's from him that flocks, herds, men, every sort of wild beast,
and every thing that's born calls feeble life to itself;
And then, to him they are returned and all those released are carried back,
not to the realm of death, but each one flies, alive,
and climbs into the rank of stars in high heaven.

If you'd unseal their narrow home and the honey stored
in their treasure chest, first caress your mouth with a splash of water
and with your hand spread trailing smoke before you.
========================================

Bis gravidos cogunt fetus, duo tempora messis,&
Taygete simul os terris ostendit honestum&
Pleas et Oceani spretos pede reppulit amnes,&
aut eadem sidus fugiens ubi Piscis aquosi&
tristior hibernas caelo descendit in undas. &              235
Illis ira modum supra est, laesaeque venenum&
morsibus inspirant et spicula caeca relinquunt&
adfixae venis animasque in vulnere ponunt.&
Sin duram metues hiemem parcesque futuro&
contunsosque animos et res miserabere fractas,  &             240
at suffire thymo cerasque recidere inanes&
quis dubitet?
========================================
Twice they gather abundant produce, the harvests two times,
once when the Pleiades show their worthy faces to the land,
springing up from Ocean's scorned rivers,
and also when that constellation, avoiding watery Pisces,
sorrowfully descends from the sky into the wintry waves.
The bees' rage is beyond measure -
wounded, they inject poison with their bites
and leave hidden stings behind, fixed in the veins,
and they lay down their lives in the wound.
But if you fear a harsh winter and would spare them for the future
and would pity their bruised hearts and broken affairs,
who would hesitate to fumigate with thyme and pare away the empty wax?
========================================

nam saepe favos ignotus adedit&
stellio et lucifugis congesta cubilia blattis&
immunisque sedens aliena ad pabula fucus&
aut asper crabro imparibus se immiscuit armis,   &            245
aut dirum tiniae genus, aut invisa Minervae&
laxos in foribus suspendit aranea casses.&
Quo magis exhaustae fuerint, hoc acrius omnes&
incumbent generis lapsi sarcire ruinas&
complebuntque foros et floribus horrea texent.  &             250

Si vero, quoniam casus apibus quoque nostros&
vita tulit, tristi languebunt corpora morbo—&
quod iam non dubiis poteris cognoscere signis:&
continuo est aegris alius color, horrida vultum&
deformat macies, tum corpora luce carentum  &             255
exportant tectis et tristia funera ducunt;&
aut illae pedibus conexae ad limina pendent,&
aut intus clausis cunctantur in aedibus, omnes&
ignavaeque fame et contracto frigore pigrae.
========================================
For often an unnoticed lizard nibbles on the honeycombs
and the hives fill up with cockroaches, fleeing the light,
and with the unemployed - a drone sitting on another's food -
or a cruel hornet meddling against inferior arms,
or a dreadful sort of caterpillar or the one, hated by Minerva,
who drapes loose cobwebs in doorways.
When the bees are more exhausted, then more keenly they all
press on to repair the destruction of their fallen race
and will refill the cells and construct storehouses from flowers.

Truly, since life also carried our own misfortunes to the bees,
their bodies will, sadly, grow faint with disease -
that you can now recognize by no uncertain signs:
straight away the sick have a different color, a horrid leanness
disfigures their face, then they carry the bodies of the dead
out of their homes and conduct sad funerals;
or they hang by their feet at the threshold
or loiter in their dwellings inside the cells,
and all faint with hunger and sluggish with congealed cold.
========================================

Tum sonus auditur gravior, tractimque susurrant,  &             
frigidus ut quondam silvis immurmurat Auster,&
ut mare sollicitum stridit refluentibus undis,&
aestuat ut clausis rapidus fornacibus ignis:&
hic iam galbaneos suadebo incendere odores&
mellaque harundineis inferre canalibus, ultro  &             265
hortantem et fessas ad pabula nota vocantem.&
Proderit et tunsum gallae admiscere saporem&
Arentesque rosas aut igni pinguia multo&
defruta vel psithia passos de vite racemos&
Cecropiumque thymum et grave olentia centaurea.  &             270
========================================
Then a deep sound is heard, a long drawn out hum,
as the cold South Wind sometimes murmurs in the forests,
as the troubled sea moans when the waves recede,
as a fast fire rages inside closed up furnaces.
At that point I recommend burning galbanum incense
and bringing in honey in reed troughs, also
encouraging the sick bees and calling them to food they know.
It will also be useful to mix in the taste of crushed gall
and dried rose petals or rich raisin wine
or firm bunches of grapes off the vine,
boiled down over a great fire,
and Cecropian thyme and strong-smelling centaury.
