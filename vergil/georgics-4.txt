Protinus aerii mellis caelestia dona&
exsequar: hanc etiam, Maecenas, adspice partem.&
Admiranda tibi levium spectacula rerum&
magnanimosque duces totiusque ordine gentis&
mores et studia et populos et proelia dicam. &              5
In tenui labor; at tenuis non gloria, si quem&
numina laeva sinunt auditque vocatus Apollo.&

Principio sedes apibus statioque petenda,&
quo neque sit ventis aditus—nam pabula venti&
ferre domum prohibent—neque oves haedique petulci    &           10
floribus insultent aut errans bucula campo&
decutiat rorem et surgentes atterat herbas.&
Absint et picti squalentia terga lacerti&
pinguibus a stabulis meropesque aliaeque volucres&
et manibus Procne pectus signata cruentis;   &            15
omnia nam late vastant ipsasque volantes&
ore ferunt dulcem nidis immitibus escam.
========================================

I'll go on to describe the heaven-sent gift of honey:
look on this section too, Maecenas.
I'll relate to you remarkable spectacles of trivial matters
and high-minded leaders and of an entire nation -
its customs and endeavors and peoples and battles in order.
The work is trifling; but not its renown, if 
the unfavorable gods allow it, and Apollo, summoned, hears.

First off, in seeking the place for a home for your bees,
let it be where the wind doesn't reach - for wind keeps them
from bringing food home - and not where sheep and butting kids
stomp the flowers or a wandering heifer might dislodge the dew
from the field and wear away the growing grass.
Keep their rich cells free of painted lizards' scaly backs
and bee-eaters and other birds
and Procne, with her breast stained with bloody hands;
for all flying things lay waste far and near
and with their beaks bear sweet meat to their cruel nests.
========================================

At liquidi fontes et stagna virentia musco&
adsint et tenuis fugiens per gramina rivus,&
palmaque vestibulum aut ingens oleaster inumbret,&               20
ut, cum prima novi ducent examina reges&
vere suo ludetque favis emissa iuventus,&
vicina invitet decedere ripa calori,&
obviaque hospitiis teneat frondentibus arbos.&
In medium, seu stabit iners seu profluet umor,  &             25
transversas salices et grandia conice saxa,&
pontibus ut crebris possint consistere et alas&
pandere ad aestivum solem, si forte morantes&
sparserit aut praeceps Neptuno immerserit Eurus.
========================================
But let clear springs and pools, green with moss, be nearby,
and with a shallow brook running through the grass,
and let a palm or a large oleaster shade the entrance,
so that, when the young kings(!) lead the first swarms out
in the spring and the young, discharged from the honeycombs,
play, a nearby river bank may invite them to come out of the heat,
and a handy tree may offer leafy hospitality.
In the middle of the water, whether stagnant or flowing,
throw down willow branches and large rocks,
so that the bees can stand on thick-set bridges and
spread their wings to the summer sun, if by chance 
the East Wind dispersed them in their loitering
or plunged them headlong into the wet.
========================================

Haec circum casiae virides et olentia late  &             30
serpylla et graviter spirantis copia thymbrae&
floreat inriguumque bibant violaria fontem.&
Ipsa autem, seu corticibus tibi suta cavatis,&
seu lento fuerint alvaria vimine texta,&
angustos habeant aditus: nam frigore mella      &         35
cogit hiems, eademque calor liquefacta remittit.&
Utraque vis apibus pariter metuenda; neque illae&
nequiquam in tectis certatim tenuia cera&
spiramenta linunt fucoque et floribus oras&
explent collectumque haec ipsa ad munera gluten &              40
et visco et Phrygiae servant pice lentius Idae.
========================================
Around this spot should be wide-spread green thyme and scented daphne
and an abundance of strongly scented winter savory should blossom,
and violets should drink from a refreshing spring.
But your hives themselves, whether sewn from hollow bark
or woven from clinging shoots, should have narrow entrances:
for in the cold winter the honey congeals, and likewise heat turns it liquid.
Either of these things are equally dreadful for bees; and not for nothing
do they zealously plaster the crevices on their roofs
with a thin layer of beeswax
and stuff the edges with propolis and blossoms 
and they keep bee-glue they've collected for this purpose
that's even stickier than both bird-lime and
the pitch from Mount Ida in Phrygia.
========================================

Saepe etiam effossis, si vera est fama, latebris&
sub terra fovere larem, penitusque repertae&
pumicibusque cavis exesaeque arboris antro.&
Tu tamen et levi rimosa cubilia limo  &             45
ungue fovens circum et raras superinice frondes.&
Neu propius tectis taxum sine, neve rubentes&
ure foco cancros, altae neu crede paludi,&
aut ubi odor caeni gravis aut ubi concava pulsu&
saxa sonant vocisque offensa resultat imago.  &             50

Quod superest, ubi pulsam hiemem sol aureus egit&
sub terras caelumque aestiva luce reclusit,&
illae continuo saltus silvasque peragrant&
purpureosque metunt flores et flumina libant&
summa leves. Hinc nescio qua dulcedine laetae  &             55
progeniem nidosque fovent, hinc arte recentes&
excudunt ceras et mella tenacia fingunt.
========================================
Indeed, if the report is true,
they are often found to keep their home warm
deep within underground burrows
and in caves of pumice stone and in hollow trees.
Even still, smooth mud onto their fissured hives
to keep them warm, and scatter loose leaves on that.
And don't plant yew-trees too close to their hives
or burn red crabs in your hearth. Don't trust the deep swamp,
or where there's a stink of a heavy mire or where hollow rocks resound
from a stroke and the sound's offended echo reverberates.

What is more, when the golden sun has driven banished winter
underground and has opened the sky with the light of summer,
the bees immediately scour the woodlands and forests.
They harvest the purple flowers and gently sip from the surface of streams.
I know not how the bees, happy with sweetness,
warm their progeny and nests after that, or 
skillfully fashion fresh wax and mold tenacious honey.
========================================

Hinc ubi iam emissum caveis ad sidera caeli&
nare per aestatem liquidam suspexeris agmen&
obscuramque trahi vento mirabere nubem,  &             60
contemplator: aquas dulces et frondea semper&
tecta petunt. Huc tu iussos adsperge sapores,&
trita melisphylla et cerinthae ignobile gramen,&
tinnitusque cie et Matris quate cymbala circum.&
ipsae consident medicatis sedibus, ipsae  &             65
intima more suo sese in cunabula condent.&

Sin autem ad pugnam exierint, nam saepe duobus&
regibus incessit magno discordia motu,&
continuoque animos vulgi et trepidantia bello&
corda licet longe praesciscere; namque morantes   &            70
Martius ille aeris rauci canor increpat et vox&
auditur fractos sonitus imitata tubarum;&
tum trepidae inter se coeunt pennisque coruscant&
spiculaque exacuunt rostris aptantque lacertos&
et circa regem atque ipsa ad praetoria densae   &            75
miscentur magnisque vocant clamoribus hostem.
========================================
On this account when you look up to see the column,
just now expelled from the beehives,
floating up to heaven's stars across the clear summer sky,
observing this, you'll wonder at the dark cloud dragged about on the wind:
they always make for sweet waters and leafy homes.
Smear the prescribed scents, common balm and lowly honeywort herb,
where you want them to light,
and call up jingling and shake the Mother's cymbals round about.
The bees themselves will settle on the seats thus anointed,
by their inmost instinct they'll insert themselves into hives.

But if they have risen up for battle, for when there are two
kings discord often attacks with a great commotion,
you may discern at once from afar the hearts and minds of the throng,
trembling for war; for that well known song of Mars of raucous air
rebukes those who tarry and a voice is heard like the broken sounds of bugles;
then the agitated bees unite among themselves and shake their wings
and sharpen their stingers on their beaks and adjust their arms
and around the king and at his very cell are densely joined
and with great clamors call on the enemy.
