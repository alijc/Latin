Protinus aerii mellis caelestia dona&
exsequar: hanc etiam, Maecenas, adspice partem.&
Admiranda tibi levium spectacula rerum&
magnanimosque duces totiusque ordine gentis&
mores et studia et populos et proelia dicam. &              5
In tenui labor; at tenuis non gloria, si quem&
numina laeva sinunt auditque vocatus Apollo.&

Principio sedes apibus statioque petenda,&
quo neque sit ventis aditus—nam pabula venti&
ferre domum prohibent—neque oves haedique petulci    &           10
floribus insultent aut errans bucula campo&
decutiat rorem et surgentes atterat herbas.&
Absint et picti squalentia terga lacerti&
pinguibus a stabulis meropesque aliaeque volucres&
et manibus Procne pectus signata cruentis;   &            15
omnia nam late vastant ipsasque volantes&
ore ferunt dulcem nidis immitibus escam.
========================================

I'll go on to describe the heaven-sent gift of honey:
look on this section too, Maecenas.
I'll relate to you remarkable spectacles of trivial matters
and high-minded leaders and of an entire nation -
its customs and endeavors and peoples and battles in order.
The work is trifling; but not its renown, if 
the unfavorable gods allow it, and Apollo, summoned, hears.

First off, in seeking the place for a home for your bees,
let it be where the wind doesn't reach - for wind keeps them
from bringing food home - and not where sheep and butting kids
stomp the flowers or a wandering heifer might dislodge the dew
from the field and wear away the growing grass.
Keep their rich cells free of painted lizards' scaly backs
and bee-eaters and other birds
and Procne, with her breast stained with bloody hands;
for all flying things lay waste far and near
and with their beaks bear sweet meat to their cruel nests.
========================================

At liquidi fontes et stagna virentia musco&
adsint et tenuis fugiens per gramina rivus,&
palmaque vestibulum aut ingens oleaster inumbret,&               20
ut, cum prima novi ducent examina reges&
vere suo ludetque favis emissa iuventus,&
vicina invitet decedere ripa calori,&
obviaque hospitiis teneat frondentibus arbos.&
In medium, seu stabit iners seu profluet umor,  &             25
transversas salices et grandia conice saxa,&
pontibus ut crebris possint consistere et alas&
pandere ad aestivum solem, si forte morantes&
sparserit aut praeceps Neptuno immerserit Eurus.
========================================
But let clear springs and pools, green with moss, be nearby,
and a slender stream running through the grass,
and let a palm or huge oleaster shade the entrance,
so that, when the first tests of newM will lead kings
truly with their own and with honeycombs youth having been sent,
let it invite neighborhoods to withdraw from the bank to heat,
and may a tree hold hostile inns toby leafyXX.

In the middle, whether it will stand, stagnant, or moisture will flow forth 
>willow trees lying across and great big stones conically,
toby bridges so that toby thickxx they might be able to stop/stand and
to spread their wings until the summer sun, if by chance delayingXX
the East Wind might strew or headlong plunge toby Neptune.
