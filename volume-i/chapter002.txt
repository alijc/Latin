CHAPTER THE SECOND.

Qui inter haec nutriuntur, non magis sapere possunt, quam bene olere, qui in
culina habitant. Pace vestra liceat dixisse, primi omnium eloquentiam
perdidistis. Levibus enim atque inanibus sonis ludibria quaedam excitando
effecistis, ut corpus orationis enervaretur et caderet. Nondum iuvenes
declamationibus continebantur, cum Sophocles aut Euripides invenerunt verba
quibus deberent loqui. Nondum umbraticus doctor ingenia deleverat, cum Pindarus
novemque lyrici Homericis versibus canere timuerunt. Et ne poetas quidem
ad testimonium citem, certe neque Platona neque Demosthenen ad hoc genus
exercitationis accessisse video. Grandis et ut ita dicam pudica oratio non est
maculosa nec turgida, sed naturali pulchritudine exsurgit. Nuper ventosa istaec
et enormis loquacitas Athenas ex Asia commigravit animosque iuvenum ad magna
surgentes veluti pestilenti quodam sidere afflavit, semelque corrupta regula
eloquentia stetit et obmutuit. Ad summam, quis postea Thucydidis, quis
Hyperidis ad famam processit? Ac ne carmen quidem sani coloris enituit, sed
omnia quasi eodem cibo pasta non potuerunt usque ad senectutem
canescere. Pictura quoque non alium exitum fecit, postquam Aegyptiorum audacia
tam magnae artis compendiariam invenit.


Those nourished like this cannot understand any better than the cabbage that
lives in the kitchen.  With due respect let me say that you have lost eloquence
first of all.  For by your smooth and empty sounds you have elicited mockeries,
so that the body of oration was weakened and died.  Not yet were young men
confined with set speeches, when Sophocles or Euripides found the words that
needed to be said.  Not yet had the retired doctor erased the talents, when
Pindarus and the nine lyric poets feared to sing Homer's verses.  And indeed I
would encourage no poets to testify, for sure I see that neither Plato nor
Demosthenes agreed with this sort of exercises.  A lofty and, if I might say,
modest oratory, is neither disreputable nor inflated, but arises with natural
beauty.  Not long ago that windy and irregular talkativeness of yours migrated
from Asia to Athens and the hearts of young men rising to great things, as if it
was blown by some unhealthy star, and once corrupted, proper eloquence stood
still and became silent.  After that who has advanced to the heights of
Thucydides, or to the fame of Hyperides?  And not even one poem has shone with a
healthy complexion, but each one, as if fed on the same food, couldn't live to
grow hoary with age.  Likewise painting has made another departure, after the
daring of the Egyptians found a shortcut of such great art.
