CHAPTER THE FOURTH.

 Quid ergo est? Parentes obiurgatione digni sunt, qui nolunt liberos suos severa
 lege proficere. Primum enim sic ut omnia, spes quoque suas ambitioni
 donant. Deinde cum ad vota properant, cruda adhuc studia in forum pellunt et
 eloquentiam, qua nihil esse maius confitentur, pueris induunt adhuc
 nascentibus. Quod si paterentur laborum gradus fieri, ut studiosi iuvenes
 lectione severa irrigarentur, ut sapientiae praeceptis animos componerent, ut
 verba atroci stilo effoderent, ut quod vellent imitari diu audirent, ut
 persuaderent sibi nihil esse magnificum, quod pueris placeret: iam illa
 grandis oratio haberet maiestatis suae pondus. Nunc pueri in scholis ludunt,
 iuvenes ridentur in foro, et quod utroque turpius est, quod quisque perperam
 didicit, in senectute confiteri non vult. Sed ne me putes improbasse schedium
 Lucilianae humilitatis, quod sentio, et ipse carmine effingam:

So what is there to do?  Parents who are unwilling to force a strict law on
their children are worthy of reproof.  For, first off, they give everything,
even their hopes, to ambition.  Then, when they are in a rush to fulfill their
vows, they drive still raw students into the forum and clothe themselves in
eloquence, which they concede to be matchless, via their barely born children.
But if they would permit the work to be made in steps, to let the studious
youths soak themselves in serious lectures, build their minds with wise
precepts, dig out fierce words with a pencil, long hear what they will wish to
imitate, and convince themselves that nothing is splendid, just because it gives
pleasure to boys: then this grand oration will have already borne the weight of
its grandure.  But now boys play in schools, youths are laughed at in the forum.
And what is repulsive on both sides, no one is unwilling to reveal in old age
that he learned incorrectly.  But, lest you think that I disapprove of the
scribblings of Lucilius on humility, I will myself fashion a poem to explain
what I feel:
