Petr. 6

Dum hunc diligentius audio, non notavi mihi Ascylti fugam. Et dum in hoc
dictorum aestu in hortis incedo, ingens scholasticorum turba in porticum
venit, ut apparebat, ab extemporali declamatione nescio cuius, qui
Agamemnonis suasoriam exceperat. Dum ergo iuvenes sententias rident
ordinemque totius dictionis infamant, opportune subduxi me et cursim
Ascylton persequi coepi. Sed nec viam diligenter tenebam quia nec quod
stabulum esset sciebam. Itaque quocunque ieram, eodem revertebar, donec
et cursu fatigatus et sudore iam madens accedo aniculam quandam,


While I was intently listening to this, I didn't notice the flight
of Ascyltos.  And while I walked along in this warmth of words in
the garden, a huge mob of scholars entered the portico, appearing
from an extemporaneous declamanation by someone (I know not who)
who had followed after Agamemnon.  Then, while the youths ridiculed
his opinions and defamed the whole series of his speeeches, I
opportunely betook myself off and swiftly began to follow Ascyltos.
But I didn't remember the path accurately and neither did I know
what our inn was.  And so wherever I'd been, I got back to again,
until both tired with hurry and already dripping with sweat I
approach some old woman.
