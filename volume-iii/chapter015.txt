[XV] 

"Videmus, inquit, suam cuique rem esse carissimam; reddant nobis tunicam
nostram et pallium suum recipiant." Etsi rustico mulierique placebat
permutatio, advocati tamen iam paene nocturni, qui volebant pallium lucri
facere, flagitabant uti apud se utraque deponerentur ac postero die iudex
querelam inspiceret. Neque enim res tantum, quae viderentur in
controversiam esse, sed longe aliud quaeri, <quod> in utraque parte
scilicet latrocinii suspicio haberetur. Iam sequestri placebant, et
nescio quis ex cocionibus, calvus, tuberosissimae frontis, qui solebat
aliquando etiam causas agere, invaserat pallium exhibiturumque crastino
die affirmabat. Ceterum apparebat nihil aliud quaeri nisi ut semel
deposita vestis inter praedones strangularetur, et nos metu criminis non
veniremus ad constitutum. <. . .> Idem plane et nos volebamus. Itaque
utriusque partis votum casus adiuvit. Indignatus enim rusticus quod nos
centonem exhibendum postularemus, misit in faciem Ascylti tunicam et
liberatos querela iussit pallium deponere, quod solum litem faciebat, et
recuperato, ut putabamus, thesauro in deversorium praecipites abimus,
praeclusisque foribus ridere acumen non minus cocionum quam calumniantium
coepimus, quod nobis ingenti calliditate pecuniam reddidissent.

Nolo quod cupio statim tenere,
nec victoria mi placet parata.

"We see", he said, "to whom one's property is dearest; 
let them return our tunic to us and take their cloak."
Although the exchange pleased the country fellow and the woman,
nevertheless some fly-by-night lawyers, who wanted to make a profit of the
cloak, urgently demanded that both garments be deposited with them and that a
judge should examine the complaint on the next day.  For not only
the matter that seemed to be in dispute, but something else needed
to be ferreted out, that on both parts there was a suspicion of robbery.
Things were already pleasing to the go-betweens, and I don't know 
which of the dealers, bald, with a lumpy forehead, who was accustomed to
sometimes take up lawsuits, had taken possession of the cloak and was
asserting that he would be give it up tomorrow.
But it was apparent that nothing else would do except that the clothes would be 
deposited among thieves and then kept close, 
and that we would not come to the law for fear of our guilt being exposed.

We clearly desired the same thing. And so chance aided the wishes of both
sides. For the country fellow was indignant that we would demand that
our patched rag be exhibited, hurled the tunic in Ascyltos' face and 
ordered us, now freed from the complaint, to hand over the cloak, because it
alone had caused the dispute, and having recovered (or so we thought) our
treasure we ran headlong to the inn, and after shutting the doors we began to
laugh that the cunning of the perjuring dealers was nothing less than calumny,
that had restored our money to us by their remarkable shrewdness.

I don't want to have at once what I desire,
nor does an easy victory please me.
