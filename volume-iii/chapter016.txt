[XVI] 

Sed ut primum beneficio Gitonis praeparata nos implevimus cena, ostium
satis audaci strepitu impulsum exsonuit. Cum et ipsi ergo pallidi
rogaremus quis esset: "Aperi, inquit, iam scies." Dumque loquimur, sera
sua sponte delapsa cecidit reclusaeque subito fores admiserunt
intrantem. Mulier autem erat operto capite, et: "Me derisisse, inquit,
vos putabatis? Ego sum ancilla Quartillae, cuius vos sacrum ante
cryptam turbastis. Ecce ipsa venit ad stabulum petitque ut vobiscum
loqui liceat. Nolite perturbari. Nec accusat errorem vestrum nec punit,
immo potius miratur, quis deus iuvenes tam urbanos in suam regionem
detulerit."

But just as we filled on the dinner that Giton had kindly prepared for
us, the door resounded with a bold enough knocking din.  And when we,
now pale, asked who it was: "Open up, someone said, and you'll soon
know."  And while we talk, the bar of the door fell down of its own
accord and doors were thrown open and let in our visitor.  Now it was
the veiled woman, who said: "Did you think that you mocked me?  I am 
the maid of Quartilla, whose holy rite before the grotto you disturbed.
Look! She herself is coming to the inn and asks if she may speak with
you. Don't be disturbed.  She doesn't find fault with you or chastise
you for an error. on the contrary, she marvels all the more, that some
god bestowed such courteous young men on her district.
