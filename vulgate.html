<p>AJC
<!--36 Et prosecutus est eum Simon, et qui cum illo erant.-->
And Simon followed him, and everyone who was with him.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--37 Et cum invenissent eum, dixerunt ei: Quia omnes quærunt te.-->
And when they'd found him, they said to him: Because they are all seeking you.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--38 Et ait illis: Eamus in proximos vicos, et civitates, ut et ibi prædicem:
  ad hoc enim veni.-->
And he said to them: Let us go to the neighboring villages and towns, so that I
might preach there, for this is why I came.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--39 Et erat prædicans in synagogis eorum, et in omni Galilæa, et dæmonia --
  ejiciens.-->
And he was preaching in their synagogues, and in all of Galilee, and casting out
demons. 
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--40 Et venit ad eum leprosus deprecans eum: et genu flexo dixit ei: Si vis,
 potes me mundare.-->
And a leper came to him, begging him: and on bended knee said to him: If thou
wishes, thou can make me clean.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--41 Jesus autem misertus ejus, extendit manum suam: et tangens eum, ait illi:
  Volo: mundare.-->
Now Jesus felt compassion for him, and stretched out his hand, and touching
him, said to him: I so wish: be clean.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--42 Et cum dixisset, statim discessit ab eo lepra, et mundatus est.-->
And as soon as he had spoken, at once the leprosy withdrew from the man, and he
was cleansed.
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--43 Et comminatus est ei, statimque ejecit illum,-->
And he rebuked him, and discharged him at once,
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--44 et dicit ei: Vide nemini dixeris: sed vade, ostende te principi 
  sacerdotum, et offer pro emundatione tua, quæ præcepit Moyses in testimonium
  illis.-->
and said to him: See that thou tell no one: but go, show yourself to the head
priest, and present for thy cleansing what Moses commanded,
in testimony of these things. 
</p>
 
<p>AJC
<!--45 At ille egressus cœpit prædicare, et diffamare sermonem, ita ut jam non
  posset manifeste introire in civitatem, sed foris in desertis locis
  esset, et conveniebant ad eum undique.-->
But when that one had gone out he began to proclaim, and to spread news of the
speech, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but stayed outside in
deserted places, and people would come to him from all directions.
